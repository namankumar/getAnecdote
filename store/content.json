Glamorous, influential and inspiring, she has bagged dozens of honours, while forging a career in research and guiding national policy, as the government\u2019s former chief maths adviser.\n\nWith maths education rising ever higher up the political agenda, Hoyles, 71, is in demand for her insights on how best to get children to do their sums.\n\nAnd she doesn\u2019t think much of the UK government\u2019s proposed times-table tests for nine-year-olds.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really worried about them,\u201d she says. \u201cI have yet to see a primary school that doesn\u2019t teach times tables. Everybody knows it\u2019s important. You really need to know your basic facts \u2013 that is not the contention \u2013 but why do you have to have this timed test? I don\u2019t quite get it. It will cause a lot of anxiety and waste a lot of money and time.\n\n\u201cWhere is the evidence that this will make a difference? If there is evidence, I\u2019m very happy to read it.\u201d\n\n\u2018We could set the world on fire\u2019\n\nThroughout a long and varied career, Hoyles has retained an academic\u2019s thirst for questioning. Although she was once in the thick of policymaking, as a government adviser and then as the first director of the National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics (NCETM), she has always retained her post as a professor at the UCL Institute of Education.\n\nHoyles has always shined at maths. She went to Loughton County High School for Girls in Essex \u2013 a grammar that later became part of Roding Valley High \u2013 where she remembers her pure-maths teacher being very \u201ccareful and caring\u201d, and her applied-maths teacher being \u201cvery dashing\u201d.\n\nShe won a place at the University of Manchester and graduated with a first-class degree in maths, before returning south, moving to Plaistow, East London. Over the next five years, Hoyles taught maths at London schools, but continued her studies, going on to complete a PGCE and MEd.\n\nHer first lecturing job was at the former Polytechnic of North London, and in 1984 she was made professor of maths education at the UCL Institute of Education (IoE).\n\nNearly 30 years on, she is now thinking of going part-time in January when her husband and IoE colleague Richard Noss, also a maths education professor, retires. But she eschews the idea of giving up work entirely; after all, there is always so much going on in maths.\n\nIn the past few years, the East Asian style of \u201cmastery\u201d teaching has been sweeping across England. There has been a new curriculum, new Sats, a new GCSE and a new A level. And that\u2019s not all. We meet just after chancellor Philip Hammond announced a Budget that was big on maths teaching. The government has promised to spend millions on getting the nation\u2019s children skilled up in the subject. Hoyles hopes this will help to close the large variations in maths achievement \u2013 most obviously between disadvantaged and advantaged pupils, but also between boys and girls, and between Asian, white and black students.\n\nHammond\u2019s announcement of an \u00a38.5 million pot for piloting new methods of teaching children who failed to get a grade 4 (formerly C) at GCSE maths \u2013 156,352 pupils in 2017 \u2013 is \u201cbrilliant\u201d, she says. \u201cIf they try to do something different using digital technologies, we could set the world on fire,\u201d she says.\n\nThe use of computers in maths education has been a major strand in her research. She believes that although these pupils might not see the fascination of maths, there are ways to persuade them to invest the effort to improve in the subject.\n\nBetween 1987 and 1990, Hoyles was involved in one of the more unusual ways of doing this \u2013 as the \u201cmaths prof\u201d on TV show Fun and Games. \u201cOne thing that has underlined all my working life, perhaps my life, is that I like doing new things,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cIt was great. They had a celebrity who set the puzzles and they wanted a maths professor to say, \u2018If you think of this mathematically, everything will be clear\u2019 \u2013 and that was my job.\u201d\n\nHer work ever since has been about engaging pupils \u2013 she is currently working on a project to use the Scratch starter programming language developed by Massachusetts Institute of Technology to teach maths.\n\n\u201cDigital technology can make maths come alive\u2026 One kid said, \u2018It\u2019s like magic in front of my eyes.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u2018It\u2019s just too much\u2019\n\nThe argument that education is about more than just test results has been a long-held belief of Hoyles\u2019. In a piece she wrote with Richard Noss and Harvey Goldstein in 1992, the authors argued against the introduction of Sats, branding them \u201ccrude standardised tests\u201d and calling for sampling instead.\n\n\u201cI suppose, in a funny way, maths has benefited [from Sats],\u201d she reflects. \u201cBecause it gets more money. But it [the Sats system] has its downsides in that it causes so much stress. I\u2019ve noticed in many primaries just how long they spend in Year 6 training for the key stage 2 tests. I understand why, but it\u2019s too much.\u201d\n\nArguing from the outside is one thing, but when she had the chance to join the former Department for Education and Skills as chief mathematics adviser, she gained an insider\u2019s insight into policymaking.\n\nOne of her jobs was to push through the recommendations from the 2004 Making Mathematics Count report by Adrian Smith \u2013 one of which was to set up the NCETM, which she went on to lead.\n\nBut during this entire time, she kept her job at the IoE, working part-time in both posts. (Working with PhD students while teaching and doing research \u201ckeeps you quite sane\u201d, she says.)\n\nHer work has brought great recognition: she was made an OBE in 2004; was the first recipient of the Royal Society Kavli Education Medal in 2010; and was made a Dame in 2014.\n\n\u201cI have done a lot of very different jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cYou meet people from all over the world and it opens your eyes to how maths might be taught in different ways.\u201d\n\nHoyles describes herself as \u201cenergetic\u201d. She is lucky to be fit and still playing tennis, she says. But does she never become dispirited by the mantra that the UK is bad at maths? After all, that is why all these millions of pounds are being pledged. Of course, Hoyles is happy about money going into maths education. But after many years, visiting many schools in many countries, she is concerned at the rhetoric about our \u201cfailing\u201d pupils and teachers.\n\n\u201cI know we could do better,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we\u2019re not so bad. I think it is over-egged, how bad we are. I think there are some fantastic schools and fantastic maths teachers, and when you get a good community of maths teachers who are really working together here. I don\u2019t think you will get anywhere better.\u201d\n\n@teshelen", "image": "https://www.tes.com/sites/default/files/news_article_images/tes081217_18_hero.jpg", "subject": "anxiety"}, "2acc39066c2506eae4b85db2d4cb4def": {"title": "Children Counselled For Anxiety By Childline At Highest Ever Levels, And They Don&#39;t Feel Like ...", "summary": "A 17-year-old girl told Childline: \u201cI suffer with anxiety and panic attacks and find it difficult to leave the house.

A 17-year-old girl told Childline: \u201cI suffer with anxiety and panic attacks and find it difficult to leave the house. I was referred to CAMHS but I was on a waiting list for eight months and during that time my anxiety got worse so I never went because I was too scared. \u201cEvery day feels impossible and so difficult and I know I need help but the thought of having to sit there and talk openly, having to re-visit old memories and thoughts with a stranger terrifies me.\u201d\n\nEvery day feels impossible and difficult and I know I need help but the thought of having to sit there and talk openly with a stranger terrifies me.\" Anonymous 17-year-old girl calling Childline.\n\nYoung people have also experienced challenges at home, with some having their anxiety dismissed by parents as an \u201coverreaction\u201d or a \u201cpassing phase\u201d. In some cases, young people turned to self-harm as a means to cope with their anxious feelings, while others told counsellors they experienced other mental and emotional health problems, such as loneliness and depression. In response to the increase in figures, the NSPCC has published advice for parents to help manage their children\u2019s anxiety: 1. Listen carefully to your child\u2019s fears and worries. 2. Stay calm and offer reassurance and comfort when they become anxious. 3. Find ways to help them relax, such as breathing exercises which is also a good way to control panic attacks. 4. Encourage them to live healthily and exercise. Dame Esther Rantzen, founder and president of Childline said: \u201cIt\u2019s only natural for children and young people to feel worried sometimes, but when they are plagued by constant fears which result in panic attacks and make them too anxious to leave their homes, then they need urgent support. \u201cChildline is often the first place they come for help because they know they can talk to us in confidence about their fears and worries.\u201d Children and young people can contact Childline for free, confidential support and advice, 24 hours a day on 0800 1111 or at www.childline.org.uk.

E: Extraversion; I: Introversion; S: Sensing; N: Intuition; T: Thinking; F: Feeling; J: Judging; P: Perceiving.\n\nENTP: When you feel stuck and unchallenged in your career.\n\nFeeling locked into a job or career field you dislike is what causes you the most anxiety. You\u2019re prone to feeling trapped and unfulfilled in your work, especially when you\u2019ve been in your position for some time or you seem to do the same tasks every day. Make sure you\u2019re challenging yourself to explore opportunities within the confines of your job before jumping to a new one. Familiarity can be stifling, or it can be the stable base from which you roam and grow.\n\nISTP: When everyone is stressing out at work.\n\nAs long as you have time and space to work through problems on your own, you could go years without feeling stressed. But if everyone is freaking out on the job, forcing you to step in and solve tons of problems for others? You\u2019ll come home from work every day feeling anxious. Luckily, you can think of this as a problem to solve creatively and logically \u2014 which is your strong suit. Propose a setup where you feel you can be most effective, or find a way to completely detach from work when you head home at the end of your day.\n\nENFP: When you feel trapped in a relationship.\n\nWhen you feel you haven\u2019t grown in your relationship or there\u2019s nothing left to explore with your partner, you may start to feel anxiety \u2014 almost like you\u2019re living in a cage. This is the time to express to your partner your need to branch out (which you tend to bottle up), and propose an interesting new way you can expand as a couple, whether that\u2019s picking up a new hobby, trying something new in bed, or having more date nights like you did in the beginning of your relationship. If that doesn\u2019t work, it may be time to move on.\n\nISFJ: When you\u2019re constantly pushed outside your comfort zone.\n\nYou\u2019re not the \u201ctry anything once\u201d type by any means. You know your values, and you know what you stand for. You know what\u2019s best for you and your relationships. You don\u2019t like to be constantly pushed outside the box. Remember, sometimes trying new things can help you grow \u2014 but only if they fall within the scope of what you care about. If your friends or partner is constantly trying to get you to do something you simply don\u2019t want to do, explain that you\u2019re feeling pressured (no matter how much you hate these loaded conversations).\n\nESTP: When you\u2019re locked into a rigid routine.\n\nYou crave the ability to do what you want, when you want. You also like being challenged with constantly new and evolving environments, whether you\u2019re playing pick-up sports or working with technical problems on the job. You dislike anything that\u2019s too sequential or routine, from a job where you do the same thing each day to a relationship that\u2019s pretty vanilla. Stick to your commitments each day, but carve out time in your schedule that\u2019s planned as well as time when you can be entirely spontaneous.\n\nINTP: When you\u2019re \u201cthe shoulder to cry on\u201d with friends.\n\nYou like hanging out with your friends, but you really like coming and going as you please \u2014 with some periods of alone time when you\u2019re simply not as social. When you have a friend who leans into you too much for emotional support, you start to feel very anxious. You dislike being tied to strong emotions in a way you can\u2019t escape. Next time you\u2019ve got a friend who\u2019s feeling down, remember that it\u2019s important to be there for those you care about, but you can also enlist the group to help with the pick-me-up efforts.", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4ZeDhygR4PhFKsPR5ch73g--~B/aD0xMDAwO3c9MTUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/8b1b2a01fc3f0b9975cb9475bf4a7e26", "subject": "anxiety"}, "3a9589773794da2850a940c40dfbd6a4": {"title": "Having it all?: Is anxiety the new hysteria?", "summary": "LOCAL Stress Pexels pexels.comI began out-of-water drowning in March of 1999.

No matter what I tried, I could not breathe. I was a sophomore in college and I went to the health clinic on campus, where everyone emerged diagnosed with either an STD or mono. The doctor examined me for asthma symptoms and determined I was fine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s midterms,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re probably just anxious. Are you anxious?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said.\n\nHe ignored me, scrawled \u201cAnxious\u201d across my chart, and prescribed Paxil. The drug didn\u2019t help me breathe, but it did disorient me for weeks. I feared another doctor\u2019s dismissal, and I quit the drug and suffered until the ailment abated.\n\nTen years later, I had a similar experience here in Tampa. I was on the way to work when a pain in my side dropped me to my knees. I felt an invisible knife slide beneath my ribcage, and then I felt like something was leaking into my body cavity. Short on cash, I tried to drive myself to the hospital, rather than call an ambulance. When the horizon went vertical and the pain blurred the edges of my vision, I pulled into a doctor\u2019s clinic for help. I can still picture the nurse looking over a manila file folder at the front desk. He refused to look up at me and shooed me away. Eyes still on his chart, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re probably fine. Just go to the ER to get it checked out.\u201d\n\nI crawled to my car on all fours in a business suit, now aware an ambulance was a must. The pain was too great to use the phone, and I collapsed on the black asphalt next to a huge blue dumpster. I looked up at the sky and noticed two rainbow-stockinged feet in Converse shoes sticking out of the blue bin. The dumpster-diver heard me moaning and sat up like a prairie dog sentinel. He jumped out, knelt next to me, and whipped out a cell phone. He called an ambulance and stayed until it arrived; it was the only kindness I received that day. The ambulance took me to a physician who ran a series of tests. The tests were inconclusive.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s probably one of those housewives who just wants benzos,\" he stage-whispered to my nurse. \"Send her home. I think it\u2019s just . . .\u201d but I finished for him: \u201cAnxiety.\u201d I was readmitted to the hospital by dawn the next day, suffering from multiple, sharp, kidney stones.\n\nWhen, in the spring of 2017, both of my arms suddenly went numb and felt like they were on fire, I knew that I was going to have a long fight ahead of me to find out what was wrong. I went to the emergency room, but the doctors examined me and said they found nothing.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re probably just anxious. Are you anxious?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, feeling an overwhelming sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\n\nHe ignored me, scrawled \u201cAnxious\u201d across my chart, and proscribed Xanax. I considered strangling him with his stethoscope. I left that doctor and visited, not one, but twelve other specialists \u2014 hand, wrist, nerve, shoulder, and so on \u2014 and each one either ruled or said they suspected that the ailment was the result of anxiety.\n\nI had a breakthrough when a physical therapist treated me for a shoulder injury that I knew I did not have.\n\n\u201cI believe you,\u201d she insisted. This was the first time anyone in the medical field had said those words to me. \u201cAnd,\u201d she added, \u201cI think I know what it is.\u201d She asked me to hold up my hands like a goalpost and to open and shut my fists rapidly for 30 seconds. I went numb, shoulder to fingertip. She ran a few more tests and declared, \u201cYou have thoracic outlet and pec minor syndrome,\u201d translating, \u201cyour chest muscles are crushing the nerves in your neck.\u201d Thanks to her, four months later, I was healed.\n\nNicholas Zaorsky, M.D., via Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n\nAll of these experiences made me wonder: Is anxiety the new hysteria? Doctors in the 19th century often diagnosed ailing women with hysteria because they believed that the existence of the uterus made them emotionally unstable. They were so unstable, in fact, that men must regulate their bodies, lest they make improper choices on their own behalf. Thus \u201chysteria\u201d and \u201chysterectomy\u201d have the same prefix; \u201chystero\u201d is Greek for womb or uterus. I don\u2019t mean anxiety isn\u2019t real. I do mean that, in my experience, doctors seemed to equate my female body with the propensity for an inability to regulate my emotions, which they diagnosed as anxiety, despite my insistence that I did not suffer the symptoms that align with that disorder. These assumptions about my body and my gender allowed them to dismiss me altogether, much as women were dismissed via hysteria 175 years ago. What\u2019s more is that this assumption caused them to miss multiple diagnoses that could have saved me weeks, if not months, of agony.\n\nThree months ago, the shortness of breath that I experienced in 1999 came back with a vengeance. I am desperate to breathe, in so many ways. If, or when, the next physician dismisses me, I\u2019ll continue to search for someone that operates from the initial standpoint that my troubles may be physiological rather than psychosomatic. I\u2019m not hopeful, but I remain insistent.\n\nDo you suffer invisible diseases? I want you to know that you are not alone. If you do, let me be the one to say what no one else has: I believe you.\n\nKacy Tillman is a displaced Texan who is an Associate Professor of English and Writing at the University of Tampa.

Psychiatrists and psychologists using CBT teach patients new cognitive and behavioral techniques to better manage anxiety and related symptoms.\n\nBoth CBT and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, the most common type of anxiety drug, have good track records in treating generalized anxiety. Therapy can sometimes help patients deal with anxiety without resorting to medications, which can cause side effects, but CBT involves a significant time commitment and doesn't work for everyone.\n\nThe test developed by Chicago researchers, however, can help care takers determine whether CBT will work or not -- before a patient invests their time.\n\nThe tests measures a patient's ERN using electroencephalography, or EEG. People with anxiety tend to exhibit high levels of error-related negativity.\n\n\"People with anxiety disorders tend to show an exaggerated neural response to their own mistakes,\" Stephanie Gorka, an assistant professor of psychiatry in the UIC College of Medicine, said in a news release. \"This is a biological internal alarm that tells you that you've made a mistake and that you should modify your behavior to prevent making the same mistake again. It is useful in helping people adapt, but for those with anxiety, this alarm is much, much louder.\"\n\nGorka and her research partner, Dr. K. Luan Phan, a professor of psychiatry, recruited patients with anxiety to don EEG skull caps while playing a fairly straightforward computer game. The game asks participants to identify the direction the arrow in the center of the screen is pointing. The center arrow is embedded in a line of arrows. Each time the player answers, a new screen with a new line of arrows appears.\n\n\"The task is a bit harder than it sounds and the pace picks up, which inevitably leads to mistakes,\" Gorka said.\n\nThe results showed participants with high ERN levels responded best to CBT. SSRIs increased ERN levels of those with already enhanced error-related negativity.\n\n\"We found that ERN can help predict which patients will achieve better outcomes with cognitive behavioral therapy,\" Gorka said.\n\nResearchers published their findings in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology.\n\n\"Using EEG to measure ERN before deciding on a treatment gives us a simple and objective way to help more people get the right treatment the first time around,\" Phan said. \"Patients tend to leave treatment when the first attempt fails to reduce their symptoms. Once people drop out, we lose the opportunity to take care of them, and ultimately these patients continue to suffer from their anxiety.\"\n\nThe researchers believe CBT tends to work better for those with high ERN levels because the behavioral therapy attempts to tap into and adjust the same learning systems that inspire enhanced error-related negativity.", "image": "https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/i/6831512672327/2017/1/15126781248641/v2.1/Simple-evaluation-could-help-choose-therapy-or-medication-for-anxiety-treatment.jpg", "subject": "anxiety"}, "53e644b1ccc6af4b1c771f38d4eaf49c": {"title": "Why Some Of Us Dread Opening Gifts In Front Of Other People", "summary": "According to Boston University psychology professor Stefan Hofmann and Duke University professor of psychology and neuroscience Mark Leary, this is a manifestation of ordinary social anxiety \u2015 or a concern with how we are being perceived and evaluated by others.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hate-opening-gifts-in-front-of-people_us_5a284e48e4b0b185e5390495", "date": "2017-12-07T19:52:30Z", "text": "The most wonderful time of the year isn\u2019t all that wonderful for those of us who hate opening presents in front of other people.\n\nImagine it\u2019s Christmas morning and you\u2019re sitting in your aunt\u2019s living room with your extended family, all eyes glued on you because it\u2019s now your turn to open a present.

I grew up in a prominently manly household where sports were the way things were. So digging through and exploring your feelings really wasn't on the forefront of everybody's mindset and I went through my high school years as a very angry individual.\"\n\nThe singer says that for many years he buried some of the emotions he felt, often separating himself from the people he loved. At one point, he moved out and away from his band and says that it was not uncommon for him to self-medicate with a nightly bottle of vodka and finding himself at the edge of the roof of his building. \"I was just having a hard time dealing with some things I had buried a long time,\" says the singer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll admit I deal with depression and anxiety, I\u2019m not going to say all the time, but these are human emotions, these are things that happen with people and I have to be really clear, I use exercise an meditation to help myself out of these things,\u201d says Arnold. \"These are all natural emotions. You're not different, you're not strange.\"\n\nThe singer says he knows the pain of not being able to verbalize the things that he's feeling, but has found a way to get himself through the tougher times in life. \"I'm here as a person today that combats these things, these natural human emotions with proactive positive choices,\" before encouraging those dealing with the same issues to research meditation and exercise and find out how that might be of help.\n\nThose needing to speak to someone while dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts are also encouraged to call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255) or text 741741 to the Crisis Text Line.

Turtles All the Way Down, John Green\u2019s newest novel, is one those rare books.\n\nDuring my flight home to San Francisco over Thanksgiving break, I sat bent over my tray table for six hours, reading it with tear-blurred eyes.\n\nThe narrator, 16-year-old Aza Holmes, like me, suffers from anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder. Her condition is much more extreme than mine: She fears her body will be colonized by microbes and succumb to bacterial infection; she has a self-inflicted wound that she continually reopens and drains; she drinks hand sanitizer.\n\nAza cannot escape the infinite regression of her thoughts, the spiral of the mind that \u201ckeeps tightening, infinitely,\u201d as Green puts it. Aza\u2019s worries, at times, make it difficult for her to stay present with her vivacious best friend or to fall in love and have a relationship or to simply navigate the daily stresses of being human.\n\nReading about Aza is disturbing and difficult, not only because of the severity of her problems, but also because I see the worst version of myself in her: being self-absorbed, manic and a constant source of stress.\n\nI often struggle to describe what anxiety is like, how one worrisome thought can take over and rule the mind, how the fear refuses to relax its grip. For example, I often think that I forgot to turn the stove off. So I go back to my apartment, take the elevator up to the fifth floor, unlock the double doors and check the stove. The dial is always switched to the off setting.\n\nI leave the apartment and go back to class or to the library. But then the thought arrives again, more insistent: Are you sure you turned the stove off? Is there any chance that it could be on?\n\nNo, I tell myself. I checked. I did turn the stove off. But there is still a needling inside my stomach, a spinning inside my mind. So I go back home again.\n\nI\u2019ve learned to write a note down or take a picture of the stove before I leave for class in the morning. But the anxiety takes other forms, too. I chew on my bottom lip obsessively. I jolt myself awake on a nightly basis from bad dreams.\n\nWorst of all are the panic attacks. My heartbeat accelerates, my breath shortens, and I become hyper aware of my surroundings. But I am also paralyzed.\n\nIt\u2019s a terrible and frightening thing: not being able to trust your own mind, not feeling safe in your own body.\n\nLately, I\u2019ve felt that my anxiety has not only has become more debilitating but has also made me bad at being a person.\n\nI made an appointment at the Counseling Center and slept through it. I woke up late for course registration. I forgot to email an assignment in. I missed a celebration for my roommate.\n\nLast month, I was meeting with a professor, and he asked me about my semester. I replied honestly.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t stop fixating on my problems. I don\u2019t want to obsess, but I can\u2019t stop, and I don\u2019t know how to,\u201d I said.\n\nHe reflected on this for a moment and then looked at me.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to care about the small things,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want to care about the bigger, more important things in life, like finding love or achieving world peace.\u201d\n\nI nodded. But it\u2019s more simple than that. I want to be a good friend and coworker and student. But I don\u2019t know if I can be, and I don\u2019t know how to get better or if I ever will.\n\nFor years, I\u2019ve asked myself: How can I overcome this problem? How can I get rid of it? This year, especially after reading Turtles, I realized I\u2019ve been asking the wrong questions. Mental illness doesn\u2019t work that way. It\u2019s an ongoing process of learning to manage your problems.\n\nGreen, who has long struggled with mental illness, has said he wanted to paint an accurate picture of what mental illness is really like, and I think he does. He shows us that though mental illness is something that people may have to cope with their entire lives, they need not be hopeless.\n\n\u201cSpirals grow infinitely small the farther you follow them inward, but they also grow infinitely large the farther you follow them out,\u201d he writes.\n\nThat\u2019s the key to coping with anxiety and living a fulfilling life. Follow the spiral out. You will find places that ground you, interests that electrify you and people who will pull you out of your mind. Sometimes it won\u2019t be possible, and you\u2019ll be stuck for hours, days, maybe even weeks. But when that happens, focus on the external.\n\nFocus on your friends who bring you coffee and grilled cheese sandwiches when you\u2019re too busy to eat, who make your stomach hurt from laughing, who Skype you from six time zones away, who text you when you\u2019re at the library studying just to check in.\n\nFocus on your family who live on the opposite side of the country but will always welcome you home with open arms, people who are only a phone call away. Focus on yourself, too. Focus on the issues and interests that stir up a desire to do good in the world.\n\nIn the midst of focusing on things outside of my head, I have come to accept myself more. Not completely. I\u2019m still working on that. I am not better. But what I am is growing. Changing. Learning.

Their findings are reported in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology.\n\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and CBT are two often-used, first-line treatment options for anxiety. SSRIs are believed to relieve anxiety symptoms by modifying the transmission of serotonin in the brain. CBT helps patients modify dysfunctional thoughts and behaviors and encourages them to develop new cognitive and behavioral techniques to manage mood and anxiety symptoms. Both are generally and equally effective for treating anxiety, but who responds to one versus the other remains a mystery. In previous research, Stephanie Gorka, assistant professor of psychiatry in the UIC College of Medicine and lead author on the paper, showed that higher electrical activity in the brain in response to committing an error \u2013 known as error-related negativity or ERN \u2013 was associated with greater symptoms of anxiety.\n\n\u201cPeople with anxiety disorders tend to show an exaggerated neural response to their own mistakes,\u201d said Gorka. \u201cThis is a biological internal alarm that tells you that you\u2019ve made a mistake and that you should modify your behavior to prevent making the same mistake again. It is useful in helping people adapt, but for those with anxiety, this alarm is much, much louder.\u201d\n\nERN can be measured using electroencephalography, or EEG, which records electrical signals from the brain through the scalp. A cap embedded with electrodes can pick up these signals. A larger ERN signal reflects an enhanced brain response when a mistake is made.\n\nTo elicit errors, participants in Gorka\u2019s study wore an EEG cap while they performed a task that required them to quickly and accurately indicate the direction of a center arrow embedded within a string of arrows on a computer screen. A new screen would appear each time the participant indicated the direction of the center arrow using a button. \u201cThe task is a bit harder than it sounds and the pace picks up, which inevitably leads to mistakes,\u201d Gorka said.\n\nGorka and colleagues recruited 60 adult volunteers with anxiety disorders and 26 healthy participants with no history of mental health problems. All participants completed the arrow task while undergoing EEG. Next, participants with anxiety disorders were randomized to take an SSRI every day for 12 weeks, or to 12 weekly sessions of CBT delivered by a psychotherapist. After treatment, all participants completed the arrow task again to assess whether there were changes in neural reactivity related to making mistakes.\n\nThe researchers found that an enhanced ERN at the beginning of treatment was associated with greater reduction in anxiety for participants who received CBT, but not for those who received SSRIs. In fact, participants prescribed SSRIs had even more enhanced ERN at the end of the 12-week treatment period.\n\n\u201cWe found that ERN can help predict which patients will achieve better outcomes with cognitive behavioral therapy, and that information is very useful because that CBT is a time-intensive, less-available resource and because SSRIs can be associated with side effects, it\u2019s good to know that a patient will do better on CBT to reduce the exposure to potential side effects,\u201d Gorka said.\n\n\u201cUsing EEG to measure ERN before deciding on a treatment give us a simple and objective way to help more people get the right treatment the first time around,\u201d said Dr. K. Luan Phan, professor of psychiatry in the UIC College of Medicine and a senior author on the paper. \u201cPatients tend to leave treatment when the first attempt fails to reduce their symptoms. Once people drop out, we lose the opportunity to take care of them, and ultimately these patients continue to suffer from their anxiety,\u201d continued Phan, who holds the University of Illinois Center on Depression and Resilience Professorship.\n\nGorka thinks that participants with enhanced ERN do better with CBT because they respond well to the structured learning that occurs in the context of individual therapy. \u201cCBT is all about learning new techniques for reducing anxiety and learning to reframe overly negative ideas or feelings. People highly attuned to their own behavior, as evidenced by their enhanced ERN, might just be more receptive and attentive to the lessons learned through CBT,\u201d she said.\n\nThe total time for set up and arrow task completion is less than 30 minutes, and because EEG equipment is relatively cheap, portable and available, Gorka thinks that it can be easily incorporated into practitioners\u2019 office settings and decision-making process when it comes to determining treatment.\n\nHeide Klumpp, Jennifer Francis, Scott Langenecker, Stewart Shankman, Scott Mariouw, Dr. Olusola Ajilore, Kaveh Afshar, and Amy Kennedy, of UIC and Michelle Craske of the University of California, Los Angeles, are co-authors on the paper.\n\nThis research was supported by grant R01 MH101497 from the National Institute of Mental Health and by grant UL1RR029879 from the University of Illinois at Chicago Center for Clinical and Translational Sciences.", "image": "https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/themes/uictoday/favicon.ico", "subject": "anxiety"}, "6c5e4b9d491ae16642d7b8830a15a0fb": {"title": "Q&amp;A: Before Ybor show, David Ramirez talks abandoning anxiety, seeking the company of others ...", "summary": "&quot;It was, like, such a big deal.

Dec. 13, 7:30 p.m. $14-$16.\n\nCrowbar, 1812 N. 17th St., Ybor City.\n\nMore info: local.cltampa.com\n\nHey, David. What's up? Thanks for working this out, I think we lost touch after the Thanksgiving break, and your show in Tampa is coming up quick.\n\nTotally fine. Yup, next week or week after that.\n\nYeah, the 13th, did you have a good Thanksgiving? I like that picture of you and your family.\n\nOh, thanks. Yeah, it was really nice \u2014 they're sweet. Good times, relaxing, naps, that sort of thing.\n\nAre you like, a one plate in between each nap kind of person.\n\nHaha, um, yeah pretty much \u2014 I'm a pig.\n\nYeah, that's how I kind of feel about myself, too. I just kind of tell people that I'm disgusting.\n\nWe're just horrible people, we'll let them figure it out.\n\nWe're just gluttons who drink too much, and eat too much and then watch TV and choke on our food as we lay on the couch. Was anyone in that picture your wife or your kids? Wasn't sure if you had any kids or anything like that.\n\nOh no, I am, uh, not married, nor do I have any kids, no. It was just parents, siblings, my sister-in-law, kids.\n\nRight on, is that because little kids are hellians? Is that an intentional choice for you?\n\nUm, now, I mean it just hasn't happened. I would love to have some kids \u2014 that would be super rad, but you know, it just hasn't happened.\n\nOK, yeah, you write about familial themes, and other people, the love between people in a really deep way, so I was like, 'If he doesn't have an inkling of interest or experience in that, then he is truly a master [songwriter].'\n\nHaha, yeah. Nah.\n\nWhere do you think that comes from for you. That ability to write about love. It looks like your family is pretty warm. Like where do you learn how to listen to people like that? I know you spend a lot of time with your fans, too.\n\nUm, you know that's a good question. I think I just gravitate towards people. I like being around other souls, even if I'm alone drinking at a bar. I prefer than to drinking at home, uh, I like the energy of the human race even though shitty people exist and shitty things happen between one another, um, I see a lot of good and potential in a lot of us. I like people at the end of the day. I don't know where that comes from. Probably my upbringing for sure, my parents are that way. I moved around a lot as a kid, too. Went to four different elementary school, four different high schools; meeting new people just kind of became part of my life, and I like it. It's a good time.\n\nWhen you're moving around was that just between Texas?\n\nIt was just between Texas.\n\nWhy did you guys move so much?\n\nDifferent reasons, you know. We were pretty poor when I was a kid, so in and out of different apartments, or renting different houses, so you know, old man would have to get a different job and a different place, so we'd have to move closer or, you know, just things like that.\n\nAnd did you have a struggle when you decided to stop doing your normal jobs and pursue songwriting or was it more like a calling because, I think, a lot of times, when you come up in that environment, some kids feel like a burden to be successful \u2014 not that you're not successful, I just mean that from a money standpoint \u2014 sometimes it's tough being a career musician, you know?\n\nUm, yeah, it's tough, but you know, I never had a career or other jobs. I was working service industry stuff, you know working restaurants, coffee, so it wasn't hard to leave all that. I wasn't really attached to the work, but yeah, no, um, success doesn't frighten me, no not at all. My old man is very successful as of today, and you know, he struggled for it, he worked his ass off for it, and he encourages all of us to do the same, so money is not a factor, it's not a fear and being on the road doesn't scare me, so. I mean, shit dude, I get a kick out of it \u2014 it's a good time.\n\nYou don't even get scared when John Moreland is taking your money on dice?\n\nHaha, uh, nah. I don't get scared about that. John Moreland. I don't even know that him and I have actually played dice.\n\nOh, I saw that Instagram post that he put up where he was challenging you to throw some dice.\n\nOh yeah, the challenge has been made for sure, but we see each other maybe once a year, and I don't think we've had the dice on us. But yeah, I am scared of him taking my money, but I think I have a chance at taking his.\n\nDo you guys roll dice with Molly, and does she just, like, bet with coffee beans instead?\n\nHaha, she us, I'm not sure if she plays with us, but yeah that sounds about right.\n\nBefore I switch back to your record, do you mind if I ask you a little bit about Molly. This is a really cool tour because you had that Thanksgiving break, and you kind of had another leg. Can you talk about the decision to bring Molly on tour? She doesn't have a ton of songs, she's got the full-length, the EP, and she's done a lot of writing and a lot opf backup stuff, but what made you really want to take her on this super-long, uh, tour?\n\nThat's kind of how I like to do it anyway. If I am gonna bring an opener, then I want it to be for the long haul. You know, build a relationship and actually, like, put some miles in together. She and I have been friends for about seven years, I believe, and we've played a handful of shows together, and we've always had a blast whether I was opening for her or following her act. And I remember when I just had a couple EPs and people would take a chance on me, take me out on tour, it meant a lot. It helped me grow as a performer, as a writer, and I hope that I can offer that same opportunity for other people. I just love her work. I think she's a joy to be around, you know. So, yeah, that's what the call that was pretty simple, and it's been pretty rad, too because she's been able to jump onstage with us and sing some backup, and that's been really fun as well.\n\nYeah, it's funny because a lot of times when you get a bill like this coming through you kind of, you know, fantasize about the two singers singing together, and she kind of talked about how that's happened and how she's adopted some personnel from your band. I didn't realize that you guys were friends for seven years. I was gonna ask you if you've learned anything about her songwriting/songs that you might not have realized if you weren\u2019t on the road with her or grown more endeared or learned some things about her that you didn't know.\n\nYeah, uh, I don't know if I've learned anything new necessarily. You mentioned coffee, and I guess I had no idea how insanely obsessed she is with coffee.\n\nNobody drinks more coffee than she does, right?\n\nI don't, I don't know, I don't think so. Um, but as far as everything else. You could meet Molly one time, and you'll know she's just a good person. There are no surprises. What you see is what you get. She just is herself, and I think she is great to be around. No surprises, good or bad, it's just been a good time.\n\nYeah, she seems pretty rad and straight up. Like, she didn't really allow me to pander too much in my kitschy questions. She just kind of called me out on my bullshit and stuff, so I thought that was really cool.\n\nHaha, that is cool.\n\nI read that you don't have a lot of fear or anxiety about how people receive your music anymore.\n\nThat's right.\n\nBut there's still a lot of loneliness, sadness and longing in your music \u2014 which doesn't necessarily reflect who you are on a day-to-day basis.\n\nSure.\n\nBut even with all that sadness and loneliness and sadness and longing, it still feels like you're still looking for something. Whether it's some kind of peace of mind or \u2014 after you're hearing your response to the first question \u2014 are you really just kind of looking for people to be around, is it just pure energy for you? When you explained it that way it just made sense because there is just a comfort about being around somebody no matter where you are.\n\nMan, I don't know. What I'm looking for. I guess that's part of it, just being around people. I mean if you want to get, like, specific, yeah it would be super dope to, you know, have a wife. I think that'd be really rad, you know, have some kids. Um, but I don't look for that anymore. I mean, I did when I was like 21.\n\nHow old are you now, actually?\n\n34.\n\n\n\n\n\nOK, OK. So you were looking for it when you were 21, but not anymore.\n\nYeah, when I was 21, it was, like, such a big deal. Like, \"Am I gonna die alone?,\" or like, \"I gotta settle down. I gotta find a lady,\" or whatever. I don't think about that anymore, although I think it would be super sweet. Just not looking for it, but, yeah, I think I am looking for peace of mind, looking to b around people. I think I'm looking to be inspired, and right now my number one priority is my craft, but it hasn't always been that way. I just wanna make better records than the last one I made, and I wanna write better songs. That's pretty much the goal, and the content may be the same, you know where I talk about loneliness or feeling sad or heartbroken. Um, the last set of songs was about that, and I feel pretty good about it.\n\nYeah, I like that you mention working on your craft because I feel like Noah really pushed you on Fables, and you kind of had a similar situation with Sam on this one where Sam..\n\nThat's right.\n\n...where he kind of pushed you into a whole other territory. Obviously, like you mentioned earlier, there is no more guard up, there is really no more fear, and I read that you started writing on the road for We're Not Going Anywhere, so I was wondering if you were able to write many songs on the last leg of this tour or if you've even started writing now. Are you in a mode where you're writing every day?\n\nNo, I wrote a little bit on the break, you know, the holiday. You know, writing for We're Not Going Anywhere was more, kind of, there was just more time available. When I was doing that tour I was playing solo and there wasn't an opener, so I'd show up to the venue at 5 to load it, soundcheck would take half an hour, show doesn't start until 9.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo I would just sit on stage for three hours and just fuck around, you know. And, uh, that;s just not possible on this run, you know.\n\nYeah.\n\nI got the fellas with me, and then Molly is opening.\n\nAnd how long did you say soundcheck is for this tour?\n\nOh, this one we kind of knock it out in about half an hour.\n\nOh, OK.\n\nBut, load in is a little longer, and we have to set up everthing. But once we get all set up it's like 20, or so minutes. From the time we walk in the door to the time Molly is done soundchecking it's probably an hour-and-a-half, two hours. So I just had more time on the road. This time I don't have as much, but I'll get back into it when I get home. I'm looking forward to it.\n\n\n\n\n\nAwesome, so you're not a person \u2014 well I guess we talked about not having fear \u2014 but you're not somebody who worries about whether or not you're gonna write another song or write enough good songs to get a record.\n\nNo.\n\nJust keep writing, methodical, going to work on it.\n\nYeah, just going to work on it. I used to be afraid of that. \"Maybe I wrote my last song,\" but I don't really believe that anymore. I think it just takes work and takes time.\n\nHell yeah. And you mentioned that load in takes longer. I'm assuming it's because you have adopted a little bit of synth in your sound, so there's more gear. What do you feel like the sound has done on the first leg, and what are you hoping the band, do you have hopes for the band as far as evolving the set, evolving the sound, certain songs growing, becoming more muscular or allowing for more space in the live setting. The record you have out, there's a lot of texture, a lot of space, obviously, very musical. Do you feel like that's being executed onstage, could it be better? What do you wanna do on the second leg?\n\nYeah, I mean, when we first started it was like, \"Let's learn the songs and make sure we know the parts,\" and then that felt comfortable, then it was like, \"Well, let's tighten the set,\" you know, it was like \"Boom, boom, boom\" \u2014 song after song we're just knocking them out. Now what's really cool is that all of the guys feel so comfortable with the music that they're all creating new parts on the fly, in the set.\n\nOK.\n\nSo it's been pretty exciting and super rad to be singing the songs and then they're all playing this new part that I haven't heard before, and it's, everyone is just feeling pretty nice and so comfortable that they can kind of spread their wings, and they're not just playing my songs, but we're playing our songs together. That's kind of what's been happening as of late, and that's been really exciting to be a part of, so yeah, the set is super tight now. We all know the songs, everyone plays really well, but now the songs are kind of changing live, which has been really neat to see.\n\nYeah that sound like an addicting situation.\n\nYeah, it's pretty cool.\n\nSo when you say the set is getting super tight, does that mean it's not getting any longer because I think, some people, when they hear musicians talk about their band like that they kind of get excited to see a set that may be an hour get longer, move towards two hours, things like that.\n\nYeah, it's roughly an hour-and-a-half, some days a little shorter, some days a little longer, but I don't think we're getting close to two hours.\n\n\n\n\n\nUm, I wanted to ask you about \"Stone Age.\" There's always been a little bit of rallying against institutions, whether they are big institutions or the institutions of our ideas. That line of Lady Liberty and Uncle Sam moving to San Francisco to run a startup is very stinging, very powerful, and that's an angry song, but you still don't give, like, a guidebook or instructions on how to deal with the anger. It's more like, \"This is why I'm angry,\" and \"This is what I think it looks like.\" Is that something intentional that Sam did, where he's like, \"Try not to say too much,\" or is it that something that you've always tried to do in your songwriting where you try not to, um, maybe tell a listener how to act.\n\nYou know, that's interesting. For me writing is, uh, personally me trying to get an idea about how I feel, you know. Songs are art itself. It doesn't have to be a guidebook, uh, with answers on how to respond to the work, uh, my goal is just to make people think. Because I'm going through these things, and I'm questioning stuff, and through those questions hopefully I can find my own personal answers, but I would never be able to find answers if I wasn't able to just feel it. Just the simple experience of feeling insecure or hopeless or out of control. It has to start there. So I am never gonna write a song where, \"Alright, here's a feeling,\" and then, \"Here's how you should respond.\" I'm gonna write a song that says, \"This is a feeling, this is all it is. How does it make you feel?\" And then your response is completely up to you. I think that's my job. My job certainly, I hope to God my job is not to tell people how to respond to that. I just wanna pull something out of you and make you feel it \u2014 that's all.\n\nRight on, and do you regret \u2014 it's kind of weird just because of the times that we're in, and obviously your heritage \u2014 some people kind of latched onto this idea that you were a Mexican-American writing songs, well, you just happened to write these songs with this guy in office, but really, especially since you live in Texas for so long, the shits been kind of fucked up like that for a long time.\n\nSure. Yeah, I was watching Arrested Development the other day, and they were talking about building a wall in that show, you know? I mean we've been dealing with this in Texas forever. It's not a new thing.\n\nDo you regret \u2014 well, I guess you don't have regrets. I'm gonna stop asking you that. You just don't seem the kind of guy that is gonna sit there and wring his hands over the thing he wrote, like, you're just gonna write the song and then write the next one, and try to do a better job, so maybe I shouldn't have asked that.\n\nNo, no regrets. I love that song.\n\nNah, I didn't know, sometimes it\u2019s tough, and sometimes it's good I guess, when your record gets pinned to the zeitgeist, but I feel like your songs, they're timeless, and when you go back a lot of the themes are the same.\n\nOh, I see what you're saying. The Mexican-American thing. Yeah man, people are so desperate to make a narrative about everything. Like, \"We have to have a story, and it has to sell, there's no story there.\" And I'm like, \"Can't the songs just be the fucking songs?\" Like \"Can't this record come out, we'll put my name on it, and then we'll tell people that it's out?.\" you know. We don't need a narrative for everything. I see what you're saying. Yeah, it's kind of shitty, but whatever.\n\nIt's not as bad as having nobody listen to your record, I guess, right?\n\nYeah, for sure.\n\n\n\n\n\nI guess we're short on time now. I couldn't tell, but I don't think you've played Tampa or St. Pete before.\n\nOh no, never. I've never been down there. This, I mean in the past I've played St. Augustine before, like, but it wasn't like a proper show. I played a patio of some Italian restaurant, you know, like eight or nine years ago.\n\nIn St. Augustine?\n\nIn St. Augustine.\n\nWhoa.\n\nBut as far as doing a proper Florida run, I've never done that in my life, so this would be the first time. I'm pretty stoked about it and to see what's going on down there.\n\nAre you going the beach, or going to the strip clubs or eating Cuban sandwiches...\n\nI think Cubanos are on the menu for sure.\n\nCigars and stuff?\n\nMaybe so. You know, I haven't really thought about what we're gonna do. I imagine there'll be some drinking.\n\nWell you are going to be in Ybor City.\n\nIs that a drinking town?\n\nYeah, it's not quite like Bourbon Street, I think it feels more historic than drunk. It's an old immigrant town, like a mixture of old Cuban, Italian, Spanish immigrants and then even within the different populations the light-skinned, dark-skinned. Lots of bars, yeah, the bar that you're playing is a nice bar to hang out in and to also get wasted in, so.\n\nWell, right now. Well I'm looking forward to it, it should be cool.\n\nAnd did you find a Halloween party in Spokane? I didn't see any pictures after that.\n\nMan, we didn't no one responded. Quite the let down to be honest.\n\nThat sucks. How does nobody respond about a Halloween party?\n\nI'm like, \"Surely there's something going on,\" but whatever.\n\nMaybe we'll bring candy and party for you down here.\n\nWe'll do a Halloween party in Florida.\n\nThanks you for your time, and thanks for hiring your PR firm because Joe Sivick is awesome.\n\nYeah, Joe is great.\n\nThanks for bringing Molly, too. My wife turned me onto you and then turned me on to Molly, so it's been a good time getting to spend time with your music.\n\nKiller. Thanks a lot. Well we'll see you in couple weeks.\n\nAlright drive safe.", "image": "https://cdn.cltampa.com/files/base/scomm/cltampa/image/2017/12/960w/music_DavidRamirez_wide_creditStefanieVinsel.5a296c578f873.jpg", "subject": "anxiety"}, "9d1441d9d1119577c052bb88fdc86cac": {"title": "Quick evaluation can predict whether drugs, talk therapy work better for anxiety patients", "summary": "Clinicians and patients often struggle to find the right treatment for anxiety, sometimes cycling through various therapies for months before the patient begins to feel their symptoms improve.

Their findings are reported in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology.\n\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and CBT are two often-used, first-line treatment options for anxiety. SSRIs are believed to relieve anxiety symptoms by modifying the transmission of serotonin in the brain. CBT helps patients modify dysfunctional thoughts and behaviors and encourages them to develop new cognitive and behavioral techniques to manage mood and anxiety symptoms. Both are generally and equally effective for treating anxiety, but who responds to one versus the other remains a mystery. In previous research, Stephanie Gorka, assistant professor of psychiatry in the UIC College of Medicine and lead author on the paper, showed that higher electrical activity in the brain in response to committing an error - known as error-related negativity or ERN - was associated with greater symptoms of anxiety.\n\n\"People with anxiety disorders tend to show an exaggerated neural response to their own mistakes,\" said Gorka. \"This is a biological internal alarm that tells you that you've made a mistake and that you should modify your behavior to prevent making the same mistake again. It is useful in helping people adapt, but for those with anxiety, this alarm is much, much louder.\"\n\nERN can be measured using electroencephalography, or EEG, which records electrical signals from the brain through the scalp. A cap embedded with electrodes can pick up these signals. A larger ERN signal reflects an enhanced brain response when a mistake is made.\n\nTo elicit errors, participants in Gorka's study wore an EEG cap while they performed a task that required them to quickly and accurately indicate the direction of a center arrow embedded within a string of arrows on a computer screen. A new screen would appear each time the participant indicated the direction of the center arrow using a button. \"The task is a bit harder than it sounds and the pace picks up, which inevitably leads to mistakes,\" Gorka said.\n\nGorka and colleagues recruited 60 adult volunteers with anxiety disorders and 26 healthy participants with no history of mental health problems. All participants completed the arrow task while undergoing EEG. Next, participants with anxiety disorders were randomized to take an SSRI every day for 12 weeks, or to 12 weekly sessions of CBT delivered by a psychotherapist. After treatment, all participants completed the arrow task again to assess whether there were changes in neural reactivity related to making mistakes.\n\nThe researchers found that an enhanced ERN at the beginning of treatment was associated with greater reduction in anxiety for participants who received CBT, but not for those who received SSRIs. In fact, participants prescribed SSRIs had even more enhanced ERN at the end of the 12-week treatment period.\n\n\"We found that ERN can help predict which patients will achieve better outcomes with cognitive behavioral therapy, and that information is very useful because that CBT is a time-intensive, less-available resource and because SSRIs can be associated with side effects, it's good to know that a patient will do better on CBT to reduce the exposure to potential side effects,\" Gorka said.\n\n\"Using EEG to measure ERN before deciding on a treatment give us a simple and objective way to help more people get the right treatment the first time around,\" said Dr. K. Luan Phan, professor of psychiatry in the UIC College of Medicine and a senior author on the paper. \"Patients tend to leave treatment when the first attempt fails to reduce their symptoms. Once people drop out, we lose the opportunity to take care of them, and ultimately these patients continue to suffer from their anxiety,\" continued Phan, who holds the University of Illinois Center on Depression and Resilience Professorship.\n\nGorka thinks that participants with enhanced ERN do better with CBT because they respond well to the structured learning that occurs in the context of individual therapy. \"CBT is all about learning new techniques for reducing anxiety and learning to reframe overly negative ideas or feelings. People highly attuned to their own behavior, as evidenced by their enhanced ERN, might just be more receptive and attentive to the lessons learned through CBT,\" she said.\n\nThe total time for set up and arrow task completion is less than 30 minutes, and because EEG equipment is relatively cheap, portable and available, Gorka thinks that it can be easily incorporated into practitioners' office settings and decision-making process when it comes to determining treatment.\n\n###\n\nHeide Klumpp, Jennifer Francis, Scott Langenecker, Stewart Shankman, Scott Mariouw, Dr. Olusola Ajilore, Kaveh Afshar, and Amy Kennedy, of UIC and Michelle Craske of the University of California, Los Angeles, are co-authors on the paper.\n\nThis research was supported by grant R01 MH101497 from the National Institute of Mental Health and by grant UL1RR029879 from the University of Illinois at Chicago Center for Clinical and Translational Sciences.", "image": "https://www.eurekalert.org/images/EurekAlert_StackedLogo_RGB.jpg", "subject": "anxiety"}, "d3131f784b0cd18c66fbf89b7f8eaa15": {"title": "Lithium for Severe Depression", "summary": "Dr. Tiihoneh and colleagues studied . . . their entire population!2 Of all 123,712 patients hospitalized in Finland for severe unipolar depression during 1987-2012, 40% were re-hospitalized.

It seems like lithium is a lot more effective than any antidepressant,\u201d said the principal investigator in a recent Finnish population study.1\n\n\n\nThis was not a randomized trial. But it did have a strength: sheer size. Dr. Tiihoneh and colleagues studied . . . their entire population!2 Of all 123,712 patients hospitalized in Finland for severe unipolar depression during 1987-2012, 40% were re-hospitalized. In 8 years of follow-up after the first hospitalization, those who were taking lithium were just under half as likely to be rehospitalized, compared with the group not taking lithium.\n\n\n\nGranted, this is a rather crude measure of treatment effectiveness. Long-term assessment of mood or quality of life would be nice, as attempted in a similar Cochrane review of lithium for unipolar depression by Andrea Cipriani and colleagues.3 But such detailed follow-up is difficult, compared to population-based measures like rehospitalization; data quality was insufficient to report on anything but rehospitalization.\n\n\n\nThis Cochrane review did not find superiority of lithium over antidepressants for prevention of rehospitalization in unipolar depression. But their net sample size was only 475 patients (assembled from multiple studies in a meta-analysis). So while the Finnish result is stunning, it emerges only because they were looking at a vast number of patients. Remember, statistical significance is a function of sample size as well as treatment efficacy.\n\n\n\nStatistical blip or clinical guide?\n\nSo is the Finnish finding just an interesting statistic, or should it change your practice? To put this in more direct terms: if your patient is hospitalized for depression after a suicide attempt, should she leave there on lithium? Does the benefit depend on \u201chow bipolar is she?\u201d Several recent studies help address these questions.\n\n\n\nIn a recent study from Sweden, Jie Song and colleagues studied 51,535 patients who were started on lithium or valproate for bipolar disorder.4 The incidence of suicide attempts decreased 14% during lithium treatment but not during valproate treatment. But again, this was a population-based study that found a significant result in part because of the huge sample size. Better would be a randomized trial of lithium looking specifically at the prevention of suicide attempts.\n\n\n\nRemarkably, a team from New York completed such a study in 2011. Maria Oquendo (yes, our recent APA president) and colleagues studied patients with bipolar disorder who had a previous suicide attempt.5 They randomized patients to lithium or valproate (plus whatever else they needed) and followed them for\u2014get this\u2014nearly 3 years. Fortunately, in that time there were only 18 suicide attempts among their 98 subjects. But as a result, statistical power was low, only enough to detect a 5-fold advantage of one agent over another. Darn\u2014okay, forget that approach.\n\n\n\nWhat if you put together all the patients who were randomized to lithium for a mood disorder (of any kind) versus other medications, and looked at suicide rate? Another Cochrane study by Dr. Cipriani used this approach.6 Of 3458 patients, the 40% who received lithium were less likely to die by suicide (2 versus 11 suicides; odds ratio = 0.26\u2014one quarter the rate). Comparison treatments ranged from placebo to amitriptyline to carbamazepine and lamotrigine.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nLithium has already shown value as an augmentation agent in Major Depression: in recent meta-analyses, augmentation with lithium was nearly 3 times more likely to produce a response than placebo.7,8 Forty percent showed response versus 14.4% in the placebo group, for a number needed to treat (NNT) of 5: you\u2019d need to treat 5 patients with lithium to see an effect of statistical magnitude; a less pronounced effect could be seen in even fewer patients.7 True, the antidepressants in these studies were mostly tricyclics, though 3 of 9 studies used SRIs8; do we have to wait for yet more studies with newer antidepressants? I think the Finnish population data, while they do not specify an NNT, are compelling\u2014especially given the size of the effect seen (50% lower rehospitalization rate). As advocated in the most recent review,9 if my patient was hospitalized with severe depression, and there were no contraindications, she\u2019d likely leave on lithium\u2014regardless of how bipolar she is.", "image": "http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/sites/all/themes/ubmslatePT/favicon.ico", "subject": "depression"}, "3ad29e198e433a919bfde1adc2a65a85": {"title": "Brainstorm Health: Alzheimer&#39;s Cases to Skyrocket, Medical &#39;Virtualists&#39;, Sage Depression Drug", "summary": "A National Institutes of Health-funded (NIH) study presents a sobering projection: The number of Americans with Alzheimer&#39;s or cognitive impairment will hit 15 million by 2060, fueled by an aging population.

The trouble is that there aren\u2019t really any drugs that tackle the root of Alzheimer\u2019s rather than just its symptoms. Companies attempting to innovate in the space, like Eli Lilly and Merck, have been hit with costly failures (although Biogen is still marching forth in its efforts). And some scientists even disagree with each other about what, exactly, it is that should be targeted in the hunt for a cure.\n\nThe dearth of treatment options ups the ante for finding effective prevention techniques, whether they be diet, exercise, \u201cbrain games,\u201d or other activities; but the first step in assessing those options is getting the numbers right\u2014which is the broader goal of this new methodology.\n\nRead on for the day\u2019s news.", "image": "https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/fortune-logo.jpg", "subject": "depression"}, "7fac14cf5e36b91329a7602c1bbddbbe": {"title": "Peterhead FC tackling suicide and depression risks", "summary": "A Scottish football club is putting its players and officials through suicide prevention training in a project which it is hoped could be adopted by other teams around the country, BBC Scotland can reveal.

In the strongest of these studies, researchers followed 639 participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging with available audiometric testing data who had no dementia at baseline.\n\nOver a 17-year follow-up, participants who subsequently developed dementia had significantly greater hearing loss per year vs. those without dementia. The researchers also identified data from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Study (NHANES) which showed an association between worsening hearing loss and decreased processing speed and executive function. In the Health Aging and Body Composition Study, participants with hearing impairment at baseline showed significantly higher rates of cognitive decline on the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination and Digit Symbol Substitution Test over 6 years. These studies suggested that central auditory processing dysfunction, as evaluated by dichotic listening tests, is strongly correlated with later dementia diagnosis.\n\nThe authors then evaluated associations between hearing loss and cognitive decline and depression. Behavioral analyses of these associations found that hearing loss frequently leads to impaired social functioning, with older adults often withdrawing from social circles and leaving their homes less frequently. Observational studies of older adults have reported that in both community and nursing home environments, individuals with hearing loss have 1.4 times greater likelihood of showing low social engagement, and 1.3 times greater odds of less frequent participation in social activities. In addition to its effects on social engagement, impaired hearing can also reveal or accelerate cognitive decline by reducing cognitive reserve. Depletion of cognitive reserve is associated with significantly increased risk of dementia.\n\nThe authors also reviewed and reported on the results of neuropathologic studies on these correlations.\n\nThey cited recent neuroimaging studies of age-related hearing loss, which have begun to characterize compensatory and neuroplastic changes linked to degraded auditory input that may represent pathways through which chronic hearing loss may lead to cognitive dysfunction and affective disorders. As hearing loss deteriorates over time, there is reduced input to the primary auditory cortex, which leads to secondary association cortices, and the auditory thalamus, which is seen in functional neuroimaging tasks as reduced activations to auditory stimuli. Diminished neural response to auditory input changes functional connectedness in the default mode network, leading to increased activity in the cognitive control network to aid effortful listening. The use of this compensatory activity may burden the network\u2019s capacity, and lead to executive dysfunction, which is frequently seen in older patients with depression, and is predictive of suboptimal response to antidepressants as well as recurring illness.\n\nauthors noted the etiological complexity of late-life depression and cognitive decline, and limitations of current treatments for both.\n\n\u201cIdentifying risk factors or pathophysiologic subtypes based on neurobiological and or behavioral data may facilitate the development of novel treatment approaches tailored to the underlying pathophysiology,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cFor these reasons, in combination with the data reviewed above, age-related hearing loss merits further empirical attention as a causal and/or precipitating factor for the development of dementia and depression.\u201d \u2013 by Jennifer Byrne\n\nDisclosure: Dr. Golub reports travel expenses paid for by Cochlear when involving training events organized by the company.

One of the main challenges for those experiencing depression is not knowing where to turn. Twitter is likely not the first place you\u2019d go, yet when a woman recently tweeted at Rick and Morty co-creator Dan Harmon asking how to deal with depression, it didn\u2019t take him long to reply:\n\nIn a 2014 interview Harmon claims that the early days of blogging helped him deal with his own duress. Writing down his troubles on a MySpace blog served as a form of catharsis.\n\nFor example, Harmon recalls the time he tried to be funny on Ben Stiller\u2019s answering machine, which \u201cprobably made him hate me forever.\u201d Instead of discussing the incident with friends, Harmon allowed it to stew inside until, one day, he blogged about it. The simple post proved to be an exorcism of guilt.\n\nAs he had lost faith in therapists, Harmon realized that, unlike the well-circulated claim that great art comes from dark places\u2014especially true of comedians\u2014he could forge an uplifting life without falling back on stereotypes:\n\nI\u2019ve met too many very happy, very ingenious people to believe in that. People have different personalities; they have different crutches; they have different processes. I think there are people that go to a dark place when they create. I don\u2019t think that creation requires darkness.\n\nThis philosophy has spilled over into Rick and Morty. Even if therapy didn\u2019t quite work out for Harmon, he\u2019s normalized it on the show. In this light therapy is just a boring accessory that is applicable to everyone. By destigmatizing the simple act of talking with another human being, Harmon\u2019s ideology regarding depression makes others feel it to be a simple fact of life.\n\nLaughter has healing qualities. But there\u2019s a big difference between the cynical chuckles of trolling and the hearty, belly laughs of true humor. Harmon has found a way of honoring the latter while not losing his social media chops. There\u2019s a lesson in there for all of us, should we be open to talking it through.\n\n--\n\nDerek Beres is the author of Whole Motion: Training Your Brain and Body For Optimal Health.

SAGE-217 demonstrated a placebo-adjusted clinical benefit of 6.9 points on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression at day 15.\n\nPatients who received SAGE-217 for 15 days and were no longer on therapy still saw a statistically significant benefit at week four. By week six, the benefit was \"numerically greater\" than the placebo, but was no longer statistically significant, Sage said.\n\nAt the 15th day, 64% of patients treated with SAGE-217 achieved remission vs. 23% of those who received a placebo. Remission is defined as a Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score of 7 or lower.\n\nThis \"is a very important data point that's often not cited as a selling point for standard-of-care medicines ... because the bar is so high,\" Leerink analyst Paul Matteis wrote in a note to clients.\n\nIBD'S TAKE: Sage has an IBD Composite Rating of 49 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it performs in the bottom half of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics.

Other antidepressants work to make changes in levels of serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine.\n\nFor patients treated with the drug, the benefit could be seen on day two. By comparison, most other trials in depression run four to six weeks \"with the assumption that it should take this long to show an effect,\" Matteis said.\n\nAdverse events were similar between those treated with SAGE-217 and the placebo, 53% vs. 46%, respectively. These included headache, dizziness, nausea and sleepiness. Two patients discontinued treatment with SAGE-217, though the press release doesn't detail why.\n\nRELATED:\n\nSage Therapeutics Shows Rising Price Performance With Jump To 91 RS Rating\n\nSage Dies On Seizure Trial, But Could Double On Depression Drugs\n\nWhy Gilead Could Have 'Greatest' Ever In HIV Drug Launches", "image": "https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/stock-brain-01-adobe.jpg", "subject": "depression"}, "66abe01ec4ac1fcf21641092e4b0b076": {"title": "Sage Therapeutics stock surges 70% on high hopes for depression drug", "summary": "Sage Therapeutics Inc. stock soared more than 70% Thursday to mark its biggest-ever one-day price and percentage gain, after the company reported positive results in a mid-stage trial of a treatment for severe depression that could offer doctors a new mechanism to treat the disease.

Six years later, her group, dubbed Butterflies in Spirit, is still performing.\n\nWilliams is also the women\u2019s co-ordinator at the Vancouver Aboriginal Community Policing Centre, and has participated in \u2014 and sometimes publicly criticized \u2014 the national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want any more violence for any woman or girl,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to do this for my daughter.\u201d\n\nFor the first time, there are four winners in the under-30 category. Noah Irvine, 17, from Guelph, Ont., made national headlines after he sent a letter to every MP in Canada asking them to fight for better mental-health services. Irvine\u2019s mother died by suicide when he was five years old, and his father died a decade later after struggling with mental-health issues.\n\n\u201cMany politicians will say that the system is working, and my argument really has been the system never worked for me and our family,\u201d he said. \u201cWith those two losses, it really motivates you to do something more.\u201d\n\nInitially disappointed by the responses to his letter, Irvine took his story to the media and eventually got a call from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in October and a meeting with then-health minister Jane Philpott. He said he spoke to them about the need for a national mental-health strategy and a mental-health and addictions secretariat.\n\nHe said his parents would \u201cabsolutely\u201d be proud of his work. \u201cThey\u2019d be a little surprised seeing their pictures on national television,\u201d he said.\n\nJanelle Hinds, 25, taught herself software development at McMaster University and decided to put her new skills to good use. She built an app, called Helping Hands, that helps match Ontario students with volunteer placements that will suit their interests. Helping Hands also runs workshops for youth of colour and new arrivals to Canada, to help get them engaged in civic life. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to be new to a country and to go and get to know your community,\u201d she said.\n\nAs a biomedical and electrical engineer, Hinds is also passionate about encouraging young girls to pursue careers in science and technology. \u201cIt was hard for me to ignore the barriers that females have to endure to get into engineering,\u201d she said.\n\nHinds has also organized a student-run hackathon at McMaster with a focus on social change, and was involved in setting up a makerspace at the university, where students have access to a range of tools and technical resources.\n\nAcross the country in Whitehorse, Yukon, Teagyn Vallevand, 21, has been making waves with her organization, Youth for Lateral Kindness. With her business partner, Aurora Hardy, Vallevand organizes workshops for Indigenous youth to teach them about lateral violence \u2014 the pain that they can inflict on each other because of the legacy of colonization and intergenerational trauma.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s being mean to your peers and members of your own community,\u201d said Vallevand, a member of the Kwanlin Dun First Nation.\n\nVallevand and Hardy also organize blanket exercises for Indigenous and non-Indigenous groups, which she described as \u201c500 years of history from an Indigenous perspective\u201d compressed into an hour and a half. The interactive exercises use blankets to represent Indigenous land before colonization. The blankets gradually disappear as the organizers recreate treaty-making, residential schools and the Sixties Scoop.\n\n\u201cWe tell you of the past, and we give you hope for the future,\u201d said Vallevand. She said she\u2019s fortunate to live in the Yukon, where Indigenous culture is \u201cmore visible.\u201d\n\nIn Calgary, Nabaa Alam, 24, was chosen for his work on a new process for producing renewable gasoline, diesel and biojet fuel from canola oil. Alam worked on the project during his last year of university, with Alberta-based SBI BioEnergy. Energy giant Shell has recently bought the licensing rights for the technology, and Alam said the company is looking at building a 240-million-litre pilot plant in Edmonton. \u201cI think it has feasibility across Canada, for sure,\u201d he said.\n\nAlam is now employed by Imperial Oil, where he\u2019s working to improve efficiency and cut greenhouse gas emissions. He said growing energy demand means it\u2019s important to make existing energy sources more environmentally friendly, and to develop new renewable fuels.\n\nThis year, more than 200 Canadians were nominated for the Everyday Political Citizen award.

Most recently, he became a Grammy-nominated producer for his work on Kendrick Lamar's \"LOVE.\" as well as GoldLink, Brent Faiyaz and Shy Glizzy's \"Crew.\" The up-and-coming creative is being heralded by industry insiders as the next great producer, and it's obvious from his vision and insistence on doing work that has substance that he has a shot at greatness.\n\nInfluenced by artists like Three 6 Mafia and Tame Impala, Walton first gained buzz in the industry by releasing a project in 2012 called EVOL with his brother June. The record made its way around the Internet and soon caught the attention of the likes of Drake and others.\n\nHowever, a year ago, Walton was dead broke, making beats at home in Missouri -- a place he moved to when he was 15 -- with no money to his name. Holding true to his ambition and character, Walton kept working and eventually caught the attention of Kendrick Lamar after working with the artist Zacari, who also appears on \"LOVE.\" His relationship with RCA's Tunji Balogun would also prove instrumental in landing him a placement with GoldLink for his popular record \"Crew.\"\n\nWhen asked about what kept him focused during times of hardship, Walton responded by saying, \"for three years straight, I told my self that a lot of stuff that doesn't make sense, I'm throwing it out. Like madness. After you get mad at somebody, what happens? Nothing. It doesn't make any sense, I don't get anything from it.\" He added by saying, \"I just practice treating people the way I want to be treated. Once I started doing that, things that were bad for me like finances did a 180 overnight.\"\n\nBillboard spoke to Walton about growing up in Memphis, making music and what he wants people to pay attention to.\n\nWhen did you know music was your calling?\n\nI knew it was my calling basically when my brother June and I put out our project EVOL. The reviews it got (Pauses) back then it was so crucial to be on blogs and we didn't have the PR. We literally just put it on Dat Piff and it was on every blog. It got to the point where my brother got invited to go to the Smoker's Club Tour. I saw 200 people at once sing his words so I knew then it was real.\n\nSpeak about the relationship that you have with your brother and how it was pivotal to your career?\n\nWhen I started doing music, he was actually in jail. I was just making beats before we did the EVOL project. Now, my work relationship with my brother is so crazy and is at the craziest point right now. It's like me and brother talk on occasion, but when we do, it's super serious. It's on a whole other level where he's making sure I'm saying something. My brother is an artist, writer, producer, motivational speaker, all that.\n\nHe tells me if I'm going to get this far, make sure I'm self-aware. Me and his conversations be about what people want musically. For example, tracks like \"Crew\" with all of the '90s vibes, sounds like SWV, [and] TLC. My brother was on that four, five years ago. Me and my brother were putting out those vibes a while ago like that and people liked it.\n\nHow did you keep your spirits up when you were broke?\n\nThroughout those three years [after making EVOL] of practicing music and being broke, people who saw me as a good person helped me out. I have a lot of people willing to help me anytime just because of the energy I bring when I come around. It's priceless to be a good person.\n\nIn your opinion, what's special about \"Crew?\"\n\nWhat made you want to do a project like Mental Health?\n\nI was in a world where I was thinking, how did I get comfortable in less than 24 hours, but at the same time, I was doing the same things. Nothing changed really in my life. I realized money really is a leverage thing. It's really nothing. It's some people out here that are super paid and super sad. So, after I got signed, I was thinking if I'm going to do something and spend money or drop music, I'm going to let somebody know something that's going to help them out.\n\nI get a lot of messages where sometimes I think, \"Damn. Did I sign up for this?\" But then, I'll get a message and think, \"Whatever I'm going through, I can throw that out the window.\" That's why I named my project Mental Health. My mom also talks to mentally ill people. She works at Boys and Girls Clubs and other places as a social worker in Illinois. She's back and forth between Memphis and Missouri.\n\nWhat's next for you?\n\nI'm working on a short film. It's about different moods and relates to mental health as well. It's about being a human and not taking things in life too seriously. It's real life. It's going to make you connect with more people.", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/teddy-walton-2017-billboard-1548.jpg", "subject": "mental health"}, "643f1d3d467ebbbcfc54b768fdf4a0e5": {"title": "Dealing with mental health issues in the classroom", "summary": "Being a teenager or young adult has always presented challenges throughout the ages, but it seems that in the modern age they are finding it harder than ever to cope.

The ability to spot the signs of a pupil struggling with mental health issues early is vital for teachers or lecturers so that the relevant help can be signposted to the student or pupil involved. It may be that attending Newport Academy or other rehabilitation centers is the best answer.\n\nWhat can affect a child\u2019s or young adult\u2019s mental health?\n\nThere are many different things that can affect a child\u2019s or young adult\u2019s mental health. While the below is not an exhaustive list, these are the most common issues that can take their toll:\n\n1. Social media\n\nBy far one of the most toxic influences that you see in this sector now is the way that social media can play its part. Most children now, certainly as they move towards their teenage years, will have a smartphone and access to sites such as Twitter or Facebook. Unfortunately, these can be misused by some and lead to cyber-bullying. The effects of this for mental health can be very serious and lead to issues such as low self-esteem and social problems.\n\n2. Traditional bullying\n\nAlongside cyber-bullying through social media, traditional physical bullying still happens and can be devastating for a child\u2019s or young adult\u2019s mental health. Aside from the actual stress and physical injury inflicted on a regular basis, this can bring on issues of violent emotional outbursts, a sense of low self-worth, and suicidal thoughts.\n\n3. Academic pressure\n\nWithin the modern educational system, there is an increased academic pressure. The importance of good results for institutions has seen them drive standards up to gain better grades. In addition, the pressure put on pupils and students from pushy parents can really impact on a child\u2019s mental health. The main side effects of this revolve around anxiety issues that can be caused along with the stress that this type of pressure can put on the mind.\n\n4. Family issues\n\nAnother major cause of mental health issues for children is what is going on in their home life. Within this, marriage break-ups, divorces, or abuse can have a huge impact on them. If you notice a change in the behavior of one of your pupils, then often it can be something like this that is causing it. You may find that it manifests itself in general behavioral problems and out-of-character, rowdy behavior.\n\nHow can you spot possible mental health problems?\n\nWhile there is no absolute science to spotting potential mental health issues in any of your pupils or students, there are some things to look out for. If you notice these and are worried, then it is worth speaking to the relevant person(s) at your institution along with the child themselves.\n\nMood or behavioral changes\n\nBy far one of the biggest flags for possible mental health problems is a sudden and sustained change to their usual behavior for the worse. The general advice is to look for behavior that suggest difficulty concentrating, sadness, or withdrawal for up to two weeks, along with destructive behavior around interpersonal relationships in school, college, or university.\n\nEmotional outbursts\n\nIf you find that a pupil or student is suddenly coming out with violent or extreme emotional outbursts for no reason. then this could be a sign of mental health issues. The outbursts are a way of expressing their pent-up negative feelings, so this is something that you need to watch out for.\n\nPhysical self-harm\n\nOne real warning sign if you notice it in regard to a pupil is physical self-harm. This involves the child or young adult physically injuring themselves through cutting or burning their own body. It is thought that the act of self-harm gives a level of control to a situation that they may be finding hard to deal with (such as bullying) along with a release for their feelings on the issue.\n\nVigilance is key\n\nIf you are a teacher or lecturer, then this issue is something of which you will no doubt be aware. Being able to spot any potential signs of mental health issues in your classroom is vital in protecting the children or young adults you teach and helping them progress through life. Hopefully, this article will have given you some idea of what may cause mental health issues and how to look out for them.", "image": "https://signalscv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/phone.jpg", "subject": "mental health"}, "b3d0327c429c13f35dd5fa22ba61a4a7": {"title": "Nationally recognized mental health and suicide prevention program coming to IU Southeast", "summary": "NEW ALBANY, Ind. \u2013 Indiana University Southeast Counseling Services has received a $7,500 grant from the Horseshoe Foundation of Floyd County to bring a nationally recognized mental health and suicide prevention event to the IU Southeast campus in the fall of 2018. \u201cSend Silence Packing\u201d is a&nbsp;...", "url": "https://now.ius.edu/2017/12/nationally-recognized-mental-health-and-suicide-prevention-program-coming-to-iu-southeast/", "date": "2017-12-07T23:03:53Z", "text": "7th December 2017\n\nNEW ALBANY, Ind. \u2013 Indiana University Southeast Counseling Services has received a $7,500 grant from the Horseshoe Foundation of Floyd County to bring a nationally recognized mental health and suicide prevention event to the IU Southeast campus in the fall of 2018.\n\n\u201cSend Silence Packing\u201d is a public exhibit with the goal of raising awareness of the incidence and impact of suicide, connecting students to needed resources, and bolstering suicide prevention efforts on college campuses.\n\nThe exhibit features 1,000 backpacks that represent the more than 1,100 college students who die by suicide each year. Attached to each backpack is a personal story of a college student who has lost his or her life to suicide.\n\n\u201c\u2018Send Silence Packing\u2019 will help us increase understanding of mental health issues and and raise awareness for suicide prevention on our campus and in our community,\u201d said Beth Rueschhoff, associate professor of biology at IU Southeast and co-organizer of campus mental health events. \u201cWe hope to decrease stigma and create an open dialogue on mental health and wellness.\u201d\n\nThe exhibit is sponsored by Active Minds, a national nonprofit dedicated to young adult mental health advocacy and awareness. Active Minds is student-driven, with 400 student-led chapters working with parents, families and school administrators to change the conversation on mental health and suicide prevention on college campuses.\n\n\u201cBy displaying backpacks with personal stories, Send Silence Packing puts a \u2018face\u2019 to lives lost to suicide and carries the message that preventing suicide is not just about improving statistics, but also about saving the lives of daughters, sons, brothers, sisters and friends across the nation,\u201d the organization notes on its website.\n\nActive Minds will have trained staff on hand all day at the IU Southeast event to answer questions and provide resources for students, and a follow-up discussion will be held to allow participants to process and reflect on the experience.\n\nDisplayed for the first time in 2008 on the National Mall, \u201cSend Silence Packing\u201d has since traveled to more than 140 cities. It will come to IU Southeast as part of the campus\u2019s interdisciplinary Mental Health and Wellness Seminar Series, a series of lectures, discussions, films and events designed to promote dialogue about mental health and provide support and information to those suffering from and affected by mental illness, especially those who may not be comfortable seeking help or may not know where to turn. Past seminars have resulted in 96% of attendees stating that they were more likely to openly discuss the mental health topic covered with family, friends and/or peers following the event.\n\nOver the past three years, a wide range of topics has been covered in the series, including Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), heroin and opiate addiction, costs of mental illness for the business community, challenges of mental health management in disenfranchised populations (such as those who are incarcerated), managing stress and anxiety, the biology of mental illness and maintaining mental health while caregiving. The series also presents activities for Suicide Prevention Week, including depression screenings, a resource fair and the Out of the Darkness Community Walk.\n\nThe Horseshoe Foundation of Floyd County is a private foundation created to benefit the Floyd County community. The Foundation\u2019s philanthropic focus falls into the categories of grant making to charitable non-profit organizations, educational scholarships and program-related investments that encourage economic development. Since its founding, the Horseshoe Foundation of Floyd County has given more than $42 million to the Floyd County Community.\n\nIndiana University Southeast is one of seven campuses of Indiana University. Offering more than 100 degree programs and concentrations, the scenic 180-acre campus is located less than 15 minutes from downtown Louisville, Kentucky. As a public comprehensive university, IU Southeast prepares graduates for productive citizenship in a diverse society, and it contributes to the intellectual, cultural, civic and economic development of the region. It currently has an enrollment of more than 6,000 students and employs more than 400 faculty members. About 400 students now live on campus in five fully furnished, lodge-style residence halls.

(Photo: NpIC file photo)\n\nIowa County supervisors are being asked to consider a partnership with the Abbe Mental Health Center to provide what some experts are saying is much-needed professional services to residents suffering from mental health issues.\n\nAs many as 20 percent of Americans have or will have a mental health issue at some point in their lifetime. Based on that, as many as 3,300 Iowa County residents may have some sort of mental health issue, and just over 700 adults and 430 children might have a condition serious enough to require professional care.\n\nThat\u2019s according to Kathy Johnson of the Iowa City-based Abbe Center, who spoke with supervisors Friday, Dec. 1, about having a provider to assist those with mental health issues.\n\nThe Abbe Center is a state-accredited community mental health care center providing outpatient services in a nine-county area, including -- besides Iowa County -- Benton, Buchanan, Cedar, Delaware, Fayette, Johnson, Jones and Linn counties.\n\nPreviously, the Mideastern Mental Health Center was the designated provider for Iowa County residents. Mideastern and the Abbe Center merged in 2015, and a small therapy office is currently at the Amana Family Practice. Efforts began earlier this year to other providers in Iowa County to have a collaborative discussion about community needs.\n\nSpecific among them, those needs include:\n\n* Untreated depression and isolation among the elderly.\n\n* Children struggling in school with behavioral issues.\n\n* Adult children with unmet mental health needs living with parents.\n\n* Individuals traveling to Iowa City or Cedar Rapids for treatment.\n\nJohnson stated that as many as 1 in 17 adults and 1 in 10 children have serious-enough mental health issues that professional care is needed.\n\nThe professional care provider would \u201cenhance the provision of mental health services to the citizens of Iowa County,\u201d wrote Johnson in her letter. \u201cThe timing is right, with a unique opportunity through (Senate File) 504 to use local fund balances to provide start-up funding of projects that will improve the mental health system of care available.\u201d\n\nThe proposal calls for a full-time dedicated licensed mental health professional for one year, with Iowa County providing 75 percent of the funding for the first year and the Abbe Center the remainder, and the Abbe Center picking up the full tab after the first year. Total investment would be $85,000, or $63,750 for Iowa County.\n\nThe provider would be responsible for completing community assessments to determine current and future needs, building collaborative relationships, providing mental health consultation, establishing a permanent office in the community with the greatest needs, and providing mental health first aid classes to schools, churches and community groups. The first three activities would be completed in five communities through collaborations with the five school districts with schools in the county (Iowa Valley, Williamsburg, HLV, Clear Creek Amana and English Valleys), churches (31 churches), Compass Memorial Healthcare and other human service agencies.\n\nNo decisions were made at Friday\u2019s meeting.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://icp-c.com/2BcBzKI", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e34438eb19025a460a505abca5bb81d50889d491/c=0-225-1025-804&r=x803&c=1600x800/local/-/media/2016/01/09/IAGroup/IowaCity/635879428129467575-Iowa-County-Courthouse.jpg", "subject": "mental health"}, "8e6c863d7b3f0e9728dff09fcaa1983f": {"title": "APA: Don&#39;t Forget About Physical Health in Treating Mental Illness", "summary": "WASHINGTON -- People with serious mental illness die 10 to 25 years earlier than the rest of the population, and mental health experts spoke of ways to reverse this trend at a briefing on Thursday hosted by the American Psychiatric Association (APA).

Also, psychiatric medications have certain side effects, which lead to weight gain, diabetes, and other cardiovascular problems. People with serious mental illness also tend to be less physically active, have poor diets, and often have substance use disorders.\n\nStress, social isolation, and poverty can exacerbate these problems, he continued.\n\nRelated to the briefing, the APA released a white paper released a white paper with detailed recommendations for improving the physical health of patients with serious mental illness. The document is the final product of an APA working group that convened in 2016, and their findings are based on peer-reviewed literature.\n\nSpeaking broadly, Druss said that lifestyle interventions -- such as helping people quit smoking and lose weight -- integrated care mangers that help coordinate behavior health and primary care, and self management groups, led by peer support workers with \"lived experience\" of mental illness, have all been shown to have an impact on these individuals' physical and mental health and quality of life.\n\nDruss listed the following specific APA recommendations from the working group he chaired:\n\nProvide training programs in outpatient medical care during psychiatry internships and residency programs\n\nEncourage psychiatrists to advocate for population models and integrated payment systems that would enhance communication, incorporate patient registries, and enact evidence-based interventions\n\nIncrease research to evaluate programs that target improving the physical health of people with serious mental illness\n\nUrge psychiatrists to push for \"enhanced Medicaid rates\" that mirror federally qualified health centers\n\nSupport federal health policies that would help track and monitor the health of people with serious mental illness\n\nEngage with state policymakers including Medicaid directors and other state mental health authorities\n\nDruss and several panelists also specifically highlighted the connection between diabetes and mental health providers and stressed the critical need for mental health providers to be literate in medical issues -- for example, knowing how to recognize dangerously high hemoglobin levels.\n\nPanelists also discussed new and recent interventions that aim to improve care for people with serious mental illness and target the problem of premature mortality.\n\nGlenda Wrenn, MD, director for the Kennedy-Satcher Center for Mental Health Equity at the Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta, agreed with Druss that mental health professionals need more training in medical issues. People with serious mental illness have died because their physical health problems have been overlooked, she said. For example, patients have died from delirium tremens -- confusion brought on by extreme dehydration, often related to alcohol withdrawal.\n\nOne intervention that she believes is having an impact is the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration's Sequential Intercept Model, which focuses on five key \"intercept\" points where people with behavioral issues can be connected with services and diverted from the criminal justice system.\n\nPayment can also be a clear-cut driver for change, said Julia Harris, MPH, primary care transformation manager for Tennessee's Medicaid program, TennCare.\n\n\"It's not that providers don't want to do the right [thing], but when you pay for stuff, people pay attention,\" she said.\n\nIn 2016, using a $65 million state innovation grant from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI), TennCare launched Tennessee Health Link, a health home model, targeting individuals with the highest behavioral health needs.\n\nPeople with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, homicidal ideation, or suicidal ideation are automatically eligible, as is anyone who has had a behavioral health-related inpatient admission or an admission for crisis stabilization. Participants can also be referred by their provider, Harris explained.\n\nWhat the program does differently is hold behavioral health providers accountable for physical health measures, she said. It provides a customized curriculum to help providers learn from each other and quarterly performance reports, so they can assess the quality of their care.\n\nAnother important feature is a care-coordination tool offering \"near real-time access\" of emergency room admissions: \"It's giving providers access to information that they never had access to before,\" Harris said.\n\nLauren Swanner, RN, of Mosaic Community Services, a subsidiary of Sheppard Pratt Health System, Inc., based in Timonium, Maryland, spoke of her own work in a health home model.\n\nOne clear focus for all mental health providers should be on the side effects of the medications they give patients, she said.\n\nShe noted that she saw one patient who hadn't had a bowel movement in 2 weeks, because of her medications. Swanner sent that patient directly to the emergency room. She ended up needing a colostomy.\n\n\"We're trying to treat their brain, and we're getting their body sick while doing it,\" said Swanner, noting the importance of finding a medication regimen that patients can comply with, without endangering their health.\n\nA different report from the Interdepartmental Serious Mental Illness Coordinating Committee (ISMICC), an offshoot from the 21st Century Cures Act, is due out next week.\n\n2017-12-07T17:15:00-0500", "image": "https://clf1.medpagetoday.com/assets/images/defaultLede.png", "subject": "mental health"}, "f186fdbca732809f671f4a8d6bdd61ae": {"title": "Authorities continue search for escaped mental health patient", "summary": "RUTLAND, Vt.

This was before hoarding was a popular topic. Because it was a series on mental health, we were a little nervous that this was a niche issue. We were not sure anyone would show up.\u201d\n\nSo they set a modest goal. \u201cWe told ourselves if 25 people show up for this film on hoarding, we\u2019ll consider it a success,\u201d Cowing recalls.\n\nThings didn\u2019t go quite as expected. \u201cThe night that we premiered, we not only sold out \u2014 we had a line around the corner,\u201d Cowing says.\n\nKeeping it Reel\n\nSince 2009, the Reel Mind Theatre and Film Series has brought mental health-themed stage and film productions to Rochester, before frequently sold-out crowds.\n\nRuth Cowing and Dr. Larry Guttmacher with Robynn Murray, the subject of the Academy Award-nominated film 'Poster Girl,' at a past year's screening. (Photo: Provided)\n\nDr. Guttmacher wanted to show films of hope and recovery. He approached Herb Katz, who was on the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) board and was also the artistic director of the Jewish Community Theatre at the time. And they approached Cowing, she says, while she was with the High Falls Film Festival.\n\nTypically, the series includes four to five films each year, presented over several weeks in May and June. It has also included works for the stage, and fine art exhibitions and short films in recent years.\n\nOne year, \u201cHerb Katz brought in a play called Living With It, a one-person play [written and performed] by Frank LaFrazia about his experience growing up with a mother who suffered from bipolar disorder,\u201d Cowing says. Because the playwright \u201chad grown up in Rochester, the therapist who had worked with the family was able to join in the panel discussion afterward.\u201d\n\nOrganizers, audience members and even the filmmakers often say those panel discussions are the most compelling aspect of the series.\n\n\u201cThe films are great, but the part that blows me away every time is the discussion that follows the film,\u201d Dr. Guttmacher says. \u201cOur format is, show the film then follow it up with a panel that typically has somebody living with the disorder, a subject expert and very often the filmmaker.\u201d\n\nOne such filmmaker is Glenn Holsten, an award-winning director and producer of documentary films. \u201cI\u2019m super in love with it,\u201d he says of Reel Mind. \u201cI screen film fests and attend mental health conferences all over the world, and Reel Mind is a great combination of both, because you have audiences that are so eager to discuss topics that are important to their lives.\u201d\n\nHolsten, who lives in Philadelphia, co-directed OC87: The Obsessive Compulsive Major Depression, Bipolar Disorder, Asperger\u2019s Movie with Bud Clayman, the film\u2019s subject. Speaking of his co-director, Holsten says: \u201cAll the symptoms in our title, he lives with.\u201d\n\nDr. Guttmacher says the discussion after screening OC 87 brought the \u201call-time greatest moment.\u201d He explains: \u201cThe filmmaker [Clayman] is this wonderful guy from Philadelphia, who by his own account is somewhere on the Asperger\u2019s spectrum. He got up to speak after the film and you could see it was hard for him, but he talked to the audience, and then this \u2026 17-year-old kid got up and said, \u2018You told my story.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a dry eye in the house,\u201d Dr. Guttmacher says.\n\nHolsten has found that film is the right medium for this kind of storytelling. \u201cThe language of film works really well with mental health. Trying to present sensations to an audience \u2014 what it feels like to have an experience of insecurity, or panic \u2014 you can use sound and pictures in creative, clever ways.\u201d\n\nAfter a screening of OC87, Holsten recalls a gratifying exchange. \u201cThis man came up to me with a big, big smile and said, \u2018You gave my story the red carpet treatment!\u2019 That was quite powerful, to think that somebody felt like their journey \u2014 probably full of challenges and hardships \u2014 was beautifully filmed and beautifully told and given the respect that it deserves.\u201d\n\nReel Mind\u2019s mission is to address the social stigma of mental illness and provide a message of hope that recovery is possible. The organizers also work to make local audiences aware of the resources that are available in Rochester.\n\n\u201cRochester makes it easy in a lot of ways,\u201d Dr. Guttmacher says. \u201cThe mental health community here is very special. We talk to each other and cooperate in a way that is very unusual.\u201d\n\nIn addition to NAMI, Dr. Guttmacher cites the Mental Health Association, the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Rochester, the Rochester Psychiatric Center, East House, DePaul, Creative Wellness and others. \u201cIt really cuts across the entire mental health community. They\u2019ve been incredibly supportive.\u201d\n\nWide-ranging films\n\n\u201cThe films have ranged all across the spectrum,\u201d Cowing says. Previous selections include these award-winning films:\n\n'Swim Team,' about a group of boys on the autism spectrum, was featured on ABC World News Tonight and in other national media. (Photo: Provided)\n\nSwim Team featured the Jersey Hammerheads, a team of boy swimmers on the autism spectrum whose parents refuse to accept society\u2019s low expectations of their children with autism.\n\nHollywood Beauty Salon, directed by Holsten, focused on a beauty parlor that\u2019s part of an outpatient mental health center, where community members facing mental illness, addiction and trauma find healing, community and beauty within.\n\nAlmost Sunrise told the story of two Iraq veterans haunted by their experiences in combat and suffering from unseen wounds, who search for peace walking across the country from Milwaukee to Los Angeles.\n\n'Almost Sunrise' was an award-winning film about two Iraq veterans. (Photo: Provided)\n\nIn addition, \u201cone of the things we focus on is art as therapy, and we tie that into an art exhibit that we do in collaboration with the Creative Wellness opportunity center,\u201d Cowing says. The curated, juried show represents the work of artists who have mental health issues. Following the exhibit, \u201cwe\u2019ll watch a film about artists who also have mental health issues, and who use their art to heal,\u201d Cowing says.\n\nThe theater and film presentations are almost exclusively documentary.\n\n\u201cWe have tried on occasion to show things other than documentaries, but it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d According to Dr. Guttmacher, \u201cthe audience wants true stories. They want to see people who have struggled and triumphed.\u201d The films are hard to find, he says, \u201cbut they are incredibly inspiring.\u201d\n\nFor Holsten, the goal in making documentary films about mental health is to present audiences with \u201cthe shared human experience we all have, and then, \u2018Oh by the way the [films\u2019 subjects] also have this going on in their lives,\u2019 which is just as interesting.\u201d\n\nIn that context, being different isn\u2019t a problem.\n\n\u201cMy approach is to find connections with humor and beauty and hopes, which we all share,\u201d Holsten adds. \u201cThen we find out that some of us are different in other ways, but it\u2019s not a scary difference. It\u2019s just another reality.\u201d\n\nThe all-important audience\n\nAudiences are a significant part of the Reel Mind experience. Cowing says \u201cthe conversations that happen after the films or after the performances are really quite remarkable and very moving. Often people will tell us they came in feeling very isolated and they left feeling hopeful that recovery is possible.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s one reason Reel Mind has developed a committed following. \u201cWe have a core audience that shows up every time, but it\u2019s not that large. Then we have a much larger audience of people who are topic-dependent,\u201d Dr. Guttmacher says.\n\nFor example, \u201cif we have a film about bipolar disorder, we have a different audience than if we have a film about PTSD. And what we\u2019re getting are people living with the disorder or their family members, or therapists working with them,\u201d he says.\n\nA few seasons ago, approximately 40 educators from the Fairport School District started attending as a group. \u201cThey had seen increasing numbers of kids coming through their classrooms with issues, and they wanted to become more sensitized,\u201d Cowing explains. \u201cThe feedback from the teachers was that it was an enormous experience for them.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny time you can become sensitized to another person\u2019s struggle or another person\u2019s pain, that\u2019s always a good thing\u201d she adds.\n\nNext year\u2019s offerings\n\n2018 Reel Mind Theatre and Film Series events will be scheduled approximately two weeks apart, over the months of May and June. Each screening, performance or exhibition is followed by a panel discussion. Advance tickets will be available at the Reel Mind website (www.reelmindfilmfest.com) or at the door of each event, if available. Events frequently sell out.\n\nDespite the founders\u2019 initial doubts, the Reel Mind series has proven popular as it engages audiences and promotes hope and a sense of community. \u201cI just want everyone to not be scared to look at each other and to acknowledge that this is the definition of community,\u201d Holsten says. \u201cWe all have some struggles.\u201d\n\nAward-winning film set for 2018\n\n'Alive Inside,' about the life-changing Music and Memory program, will be part of the 2018 series. (Photo: Provided)\n\nFilms for the Reel Mind film series in May and June are typically finalized in January, but one big title is already creating a buzz among organizers.\n\nAlive Inside, which won the coveted Audience Award at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival, will be screened at Reel Mind.\n\nThe documentary, says Cowing, tells \u201cthe remarkable story of how social worker Dan Cohen was able to awaken memories, using carefully personalized playlists on re-purposed iPods, in thousands of Alzheimer\u2019s patients and others suffering from memory loss, dementia, severe anxiety or other ailments.\u201d What\u2019s more, part of the film was shot in Rochester at St. John's.\n\nSt. John\u2019s will be a sponsor of the screening, and Reel Mind is working to bring in Cohen as a special guest to introduce the film and participate in a Q&A.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty impressive that what started as a pilot program at four New York long-term care facilities is now in 10 different countries at 4,500 sites,\u201d Cowing says. \u201cMusical artists such as Elvis Costello, Carole King and Kenny Chesney have come on board to champion his breakthrough.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/lifestyle/2017/12/07/reel-mind-theatre-film-series-conversation-mental-health/924701001/", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a89011cd1b000106d77ba0d911100dfa4a75c7c2/c=1-0-898-507&r=x803&c=1600x800/local/-/media/2017/12/05/Rochester/Rochester/636480873402530153-Hollywood-Beauty-Salon---girl-with-flowers.jpg", "subject": "mental health"}, "f19034eee3a914137facce8fd7851f95": {"title": "Daisy Ridley: Social media is bad for your mental health", "summary": "The more I read about teenage anxiety, the more I think it&#39;s highly unhealthy for people&#39;s mental health.&quot; It&#39;s hard to view the obsessional, self-obsessional nature of social media as a wonderful thing.

Coping with stress, body image and depression also take out three of the top four spots in the list of personal concerns.\n\nJust over 24 000 young people aged 15 to 19 took part in the 2017 survey. One-third (33.7 per cent) considered mental health the most important issue in Australia today, up from 20.6 per cent last year and 14.9 per cent in 2015. Alcohol and drugs (32 per cent), equity and discrimination (27.3 per cent), international relations (13.6 per cent) and education (13 per cent) completed the top five in this year\u2019s survey.\n\nWhen asked about issues of personal concern, 45.3 per cent said they were \u2018extremely concerned\u2019 or \u2018very concerned\u2019 about coping with stress. School or study problems came in second spot (35.6 per cent were \u2018extremely concerned\u2019 or \u2018very concerned\u2019), followed by body image (31.1 per cent), depression (23.7 per cent) and family conflict (20 per cent). Other results for this question include 15.3 per cent being \u2018extremely concerned\u2019 or \u2018very concerned\u2019 about bullying and emotional abuse, and 12.9 per cent about suicide.\n\nMission Australia CEO James Toomey says important work is already taking place to destigmatise mental health issues, but the survey data suggest much more needs to be done. \u2018Young people need a coordinated, comprehensive and cohesive national response to ensure they can access the right mental health supports when they need them. It makes sense to invest in universal mental health programs in schools, as well as community-based mental health services, and to design services with young people to ensure they are youth friendly.\u2019\n\nThe survey asked young people where they would go for help in dealing with issues in their life. The top three answers were friends, parents, and a relative or family friend (84.4 per cent, 77.7 per cent and 61.3 per cent, respectively). Half of those surveyed said they would look for help on the internet, four in 10 said they would seek support from a teacher and one-third said they would go to a school counsellor.\n\nDiscussing these findings, the Mission Australia Youth Survey Report 2017 says: \u2018Young people need to feel confident seeking help and know where to turn. Equally those who young people turn to for support must be equipped with the information and resources to effectively help young people in times of need. In light of rising concerns about mental health, young people\u2019s tendency to turn to friends should be recognised as an opportunity to educate young people about \u201cmental health first aid\u201d and provide peer support networks.\u2019\n\nThe report says females reported higher levels of concern in relation to personal issues like coping with stress, body images and depression, were more likely to choose mental health as a national concern and, according to previous Mission Australia research, were around twice as likely to meet the criteria for having a probable serious mental illness. \u2018A gendered approach to the mental health of young people is therefore required that takes into account help seeking preferences, as well as other social pressures such as gender-based discrimination and ideals of appearance.\u2019\n\nIt adds ensuring Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people have access to culturally sensitive and age appropriate mental health services is essential. \u2018Intergenerational disadvantage must also be addressed as a priority, with efforts led by Aboriginal elders and communities.\u2019 In the 2017 survey, coping with stress also came out as the top personal concern for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander participants and one in five (20.1 per cent) said they were \u2018extremely concerned\u2019 or \u2018very concerned\u2019 about suicide.\n\nReferences\n\nBullot, A., Cave, L., Fildes, J., Hall, S. & Plummer, J.

But it\u2019s clear that the candidates for governor \u2014 and state leaders as a whole \u2014 have a lot to learn about how to reform the system.\n\nAt a forum Tuesday sponsored by the Register, Des Moines University and the Iowa Hospital Association, 12 candidates answered questions on how to improve mental health care in Iowa. A 13th, Gov. Kim Reynolds, had a scheduling conflict and provided a pre-recorded video statement.\n\nThe postmortem: The event included a dose of denial (thanks to the governor), a dearth of details and plenty of delusions. But advocates saw signs of hope from the discussion.\n\n\u201cThere were platitudes, sure, but there were also sharp observations and specific suggestions. It was not all political talking points,\u201d said Peggy Huppert, executive director for NAMI Iowa. \u201cHonestly, when I compare their performance at the forum to what they had to say to me in July and August, the progress is remarkable.\u201d\n\nThe candidates present \u2014 Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians and an independent \u2014were nearly united in their criticism of privatized Medicaid management under Reynolds and her predecessor, Terry Branstad. Our editorial board, of course, agrees that it has been a disaster. Private managed care organizations have pulled the plug on care for some mental health patients and reduced payments for providers. An innovative crisis-stabilization program in Centerville was forced to close because state officials failed to write rules to allow Medicaid payment for such services.\n\nIowa\u2019s problems go much deeper than Medicaid privatization, however. The state had barriers to care, a shortage of psychiatrists and funding issues long before the new system launched April 1, 2016.\n\n\u201cThey all criticized Medicaid managed care, but none of them addressed the big question on that \u2014 how would they contain costs if it went back to the state?\u201d Huppert noted.\n\nIn fact, none of the candidates had any realistic answers on how to pay for improving mental health care. Manage the state budget better than Reynolds and Branstad have? OK, how? Establish programs to divert mentally ill Iowans from jail or psychiatric hospitals? Great \u2013 that should save money in the long run, but it still requires upfront investment. Pass single-payer health care and legalize cannabis? That might be a realistic solution in another state or nation.\n\nObradovich: Iowa governor candidates combat mental-illness stigmas with personal stories\n\nPrompted by a question, some candidates agreed that the state should lift a state law that caps the amount of property taxes that counties can collect to pay for mental-health services. The cap is stuck at 1996 levels, even though some counties have seen large population increases since then. But none of the candidates addressed how to overcome the primary barrier to lifting the cap: The Iowa Farm Bureau Federation, which opposed any changes last legislative session.\n\nOther candidates, such as Democrat Jon Neiderbach and Libertarian Marco Battaglia, questioned why Iowa ties mental-health funding to property taxes. It\u2019s a great question, and it's worth re-examining Iowa's regional system that is governed by county supervisors.\n\nA few candidates took the easy answer: reopen the Mental Health Institutes in Clarinda and Mount Pleasant. But other candidates \u2014 including Republican Ron Corbett and Democrats Fred Hubbell, Andy McGuire and John Norris \u2014 recognized that the state doesn\u2019t necessarily need to reopen the institutes, but create more community-based approaches that include several types of beds: acute, transitional and long-term.\n\nA separate event could be organized just to address the night\u2019s final question, on creating a mental health system that serves children. Iowans should demand answers from all elected leaders on how we can intervene earlier to treat children.\n\nBut sometimes it\u2019s just better for candidates to keep their mouths closed. Independent candidate Brent Roske said it\u2019s an \u201cobvious correlation\u201d that Iowa has seen an increase in violent crime and that it ranks last in its proportion of mental health beds. This comment perpetuates the unfounded stereotype that mentally ill people are violent.\n\nCandidates and public officials have come a long way, but they must spend more time with Iowans to solve this issue \u2014 people like Leslie and Scott Carpenter of Iowa City, who were in the audience of about 400 people at DMU. In 2008, their then-16-year-old son was first hospitalized for suicidal thoughts. He\u2019s since been diagnosed with schizo-affective disorder and other illnesses. They\u2019ve struggled with long waits for a bed; privacy laws that prevent them from even talking with their son\u2019s doctors without a release; a lack of continuity of care between rotating doctors and community agencies; and other holes in the system.\n\nTheir solutions include opening more psychiatric beds in regional medical centers and more efforts to recruit more psychiatrists, social workers, nurses and other care providers.\n\nThe Carpenters suggested the next event should include parents, medical professionals and others living the crisis every day. We agree. All of us must be involved in the solutions, from patients to whoever will be the next governor.\n\nObradovich: Here's why Gov.

Most studies in this field of research report that singing can enhance your mood and create a sense of group identity, Stephen Clift writes in Music, Health, and Wellbeing.\n\nSome scientists theorize that those feelings of belonging may stem from a rush of hormones \u2014 endorphins and oxytocin \u2014 released by singing. Together, the feel-good chemicals may bring pleasure and alleviate stress, according to TIME. There's also limited data supporting the idea that group singing can even help combat depression and anxiety, and provide a respite for people suffering from dementia and Parkinson's.\n\nThe physical act of singing may boost your respiratory health too. A 2014 review of research conducted on singing and asthma revealed that music therapy may help symptoms, but the authors caution further research should still be done.\n\nSo while scientists continue to collect more data, it's not a bad idea to warm up those vocal cords now.

After bringing her baby from the hospital nearly a decade ago, she felt \u201can injection of anxiety,\u201d and describes, \u201cI spent so much time washing her clothes and cleaning her bottles and disinfecting myself that I wasn\u2019t sleeping \u2013 I was alone and desperate.\u201d She says in a whispering voice, \u201cI thought then I had to give her up for adoption.\u201d\n\nOne of the biggest misconceptions about Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is that it is merely a personality quirk. As a clinical psychiatrist and researcher, I see first-hand the impact OCD has on people like Jennifer. For half of newly diagnosed adults, standard recommended treatments for OCD (medications and cognitive behavior therapy) will help them achieve a meaningful reduction in their symptoms. That\u2019s good news for those suffering. But the other half continue to have symptoms that can limit their lives.\n\nI study new pathways having the potential to rapidly (within hours) relieve OCD symptoms. I also work to understand how we can target treatment to brain OCD circuits. Yet, while we have some important advances, we need additional research to discover novel treatments that will effectively prevent or treat OCD. This OCD research stands to also positively impact treatments for depression, anxiety, suicide, schizophrenia, autism, eating disorders and many other serious mental illnesses, because underlying brain circuit abnormalities may be shared across diagnoses.\n\nPatients and their family members often ask me, what can be done to advance research that produces new treatments? Here are three ways we all can start, today:\n\n1. Inform Yourself and Inspire Others\n\nTake time to learn more about mental illness, serving as a local ambassador for awareness. If you read about a captivating research or treatment discovery, send it to a friend or post the link on your website to inspire others to learn more. One good source for information is the National Institutes of Mental Health (NIMH).\n\nCreated by President Truman in 1949, the NIMH is the largest funder of mental illness research in the world. Its mission is to \u201ctransform the understanding and treatment of mental illness through basic and clinical research, paving the way for prevention, recovery, and cure.\u201d\n\nThe NIMH also contributes to novel approaches to mental disorders by community outreach. Since 2004, the NIMH has annually hosted the NIMH Alliance for Research Progress, a group of patient and family advocates representing national volunteer nonprofit organizations. The group is convened to discuss research priorities and advances, and allow the NIMH Director and staff to hear the views and concerns of representatives of stakeholder groups regarding its research. NIMH Director, Joshua A. Gordon, M.D., Ph.D., convened the twenty-fourth meeting of this group (see photo below). Topics included improving suicide risk and detection, novel treatments for opioid dependence, rapid-acting treatments for OCD, improving our understanding and treatment of depression, and advancing family-centered research, which involves collaboration with consumers to design, implement, and disseminate child mental health research.

Of those seeking help for mental health, 33.2 percent have seriously considered attempting suicide\u2014a number that has steadily increased over the past five years\u2014as shown in the annual report.\n\nIn a survey conducted during the 2016-17 academic year, as many as 86 percent of students labeled academic stress as their primary concern, according to a Feb. 23 article in The Lamron.\n\nGeneseo is increasing efforts to help combat mental health and stress-related issues, especially during finals week, according to Director of Student Life Charles Matthews.\n\n\u201cWe have really high expectations for ourselves, certainly, but Geneseo\u2019s a demanding school and the students who come to Geneseo are demanding of themselves as well,\u201d Matthews said. \u201cYou couple those things and it just causes stress. There\u2019s a lot going on in the world, in our society, that adds to that stress and I see that.\u201d\n\nIn collaboration with Lauderdale Health and Counseling, GFR is similarly readjusting the training process for medics responding to mental health issues, according to Geddes. The organization is trying to improve how medics converse with patients and is working to teach volunteers how to act as a calming presence for stressed students before transferring them to higher health authorities.\n\nGFR is also aiming to increase its visibility on-campus and interact with students in non-emergency situations. In doing so, GFR hopes to allow students to feel more comfortable contacting emergency medical services, Geddes said.\n\n\u201cOne of the problems that studies have shown is that if someone\u2019s having a stress-related emergency, and three EMTs come in \u2026 and then maybe another ambulance is going to come and that\u2019s a lot,\u201d Geddes said. \u201cEngaging with students when there isn\u2019t a medical emergency, it makes it a little less scary if they know our faces, know who we are, know why we\u2019re there.\u201d\n\nBeyond GFR and Student Life, programs such as the anonymous talk-line service Geneseo Pathways, acknowledge the presence of stress on-campus, according to Pathways coordinator and professor of psychology Jennifer Katz.\n\n\u201cWe responded to 90 calls last year, so I imagine there are more people experiencing stress who don\u2019t reach out to us and don\u2019t reach out to other places,\u201d Katz said. \u201cWe definitely want people not to feel alone.

The Fed would also provide more information about the scenarios it builds each year to put bank balance sheets under stress.\n\nGiving banks better clarity about how they may perform during the annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process would come as a significant relief, as major Wall Street banks complain the current process is time consuming and resource intensive. Better predictors for stress test success could also aid banks in capital planning, as they need a passing grade from the Fed before paying out more capital to shareholders.\n\nUnder the proposed changes, the Fed would provide a list of hypothetical loan portfolios, and then allow banks to see how those portfolios perform under the Fed's model before testing begins each year. This approach would allow banks to compare their own portfolios to the Fed's, as well as see how closely their own internal models compare.\n\nThe Fed also said it would be providing more detailed descriptions of its models, including certain equations and variables it uses. It also plans to give banks more information about how home prices would hypothetically sink in an economic crisis, and additional variables it may include in concocting those scenarios.\n\nThe Fed is soliciting public comment on those changes until Jan. 22.\n\nThe move marks the first significant policy shift at the Fed under the watch of Randal Quarles, who became the central bank's chief regulator in October. However, Fed officials had indicated they were looking for ways to increase transparency around the tests for some time.\n\nFed officials, including Chair Janet Yellen and her nominated replacement, Governor Jerome Powell, have said they want to improve transparency around stress tests. But there remains concern at the central bank that giving banks too many specifics about the testing model could render it less effective.\n\nFormer Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo, who built the original stress testing process after the 2007-2009 financial crisis, proposed the idea of creating hypothetical portfolios as a way to give banks some sense of how their portfolios may perform without giving away exactly how the Fed will do the testing.\n\n\"A set of hypothetical portfolios ... would permit a fairly accurate inference of the expected losses on any given set of assets. At the same time, they would not permit participants to game the models by scrutinizing them for the precise points where they were weakest,\" he said in his farewell remarks in April.\n\nConsumer advocates have argued against giving banks more information on the models, arguing banks could game the system, or risk management in the industry will become focused around a single 'mono' model, potentially increasing concentration risk.\n\nSpeaking during an event in New York on Friday, Quarles dismissed concerns over banks gaming the system, saying over time they would inevitably work out more or less how the models work - but he did acknowledge concerns over mono models.\n\n\"The proposals that you'll see coming out from us will be significantly more transparency than we have had - but not full transparency because we still don't have an answer in my view to the mono-model risk,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by Pete Schroeder, Michelle Price and Jonathan Spicer; Editing by David Gregorio and Susan Thomas)", "image": "http://www.kitco.com/images/kitco-news-social-share-logo.jpg", "subject": "stress"}, "bea8876e15d917d95773ee31d6708577": {"title": "Callie at the Catch: Stress-Free Zone", "summary": "The semester closing in means that finals are coming and the stress levels are rising.

Thankfully the eight-hour schedule we are in allows us to be flexible, which is especially nice when we need extra time to study, write papers, or work on projects. What we are good at doing is letting go of our finals stress as soon as we walk into the boathouse. It is our place to let loose and becomes our stress-free zone. This week, we had a fun and festive practice to shake things up and help us distress even more, all while still putting in that hard work.To start practice off, we began warmups with the lights off and plugged in the colorful, bright party lights. Being early in the morning and still pitch black outside, it looked pretty cool!I think what made this practice even more fun was the fact that coxswains and even some of our coaches were getting on the erg for some short, hard pieces during a relay., a junior coxswain, volunteered to erg to make the teams even (what a trooper). Before coxing, Martin used to row early in high school, but has not done much since then, so she admits it can be easy to forget how hard erging can be.She said, \"Today was fun for me because not very often do the coxswains get to really be with the team during the winter, since our roles become so different.\"It is not like sitting in the coxswain seat. However, \"even just a few short pieces was enough to remind me how much work the rowers are putting in every single day,\" she added.Even Assistant Coachgot on the erg and was pulling some fast splits while in jeans!

Request a free sample report\n\nTechnavio\u2019s sample reports are free of charge and contain multiple sections of the report including the market size and forecast, drivers, challenges, trends, and more.\n\nIncreasing technological innovations in CPAP devices\n\nTechnological innovations have resulted in the development of improved continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices. Technological advances have led to the development of lightweight interface masks with soft sealing flange and fewer accessories that are easy to use and more adaptable to different face geometries. These masks will improve the usability of CPAP devices. The integration of IT data systems with CPAP and associated monitoring devices helps in improving therapy for sleep-disordered breathing by reducing cost and time. For instance, the latest CPAP devices by ResMed include integrated humidification with wireless connectivity so that medical equipment providers for home-care and other healthcare providers receive regular reports on the patients' progress.\n\n\u201cCPAP devices backed by IT data will allow improved patient-care and increase the compliance rate of obstructive sleep apnea therapy. These offer a range of opportunities for healthcare providers to stay virtually connected to patients and train them more efficiently. The added benefits of these products offer significant value addition to a consumer's life. The rise of innovative products will lead to increased adoption of these products, resulting in the growth of the global sleeping aids market,\u201d says Amber Chourasia, a lead analyst at Technavio for health and wellness research.\n\nGrowing patient-care services\n\nPatient-care services are broadly classified into two types which include healthcare-based patient-care services and home-care-based patient-care services. Due to the increased incidence of chronic diseases, lifestyle-related diseases, and medical emergencies, the number of patients undergoing post-treatment patient-care has increased substantially.\n\nDuring post-treatment patient-care, the patients need to take rest for a long duration, and they are highly prone to various skin infections and bed sores. To avoid these post-treatment complications, pressure-relief mattresses are used as preventive measures. These mattresses aid in supporting the pressure points in the body, specifically the shoulders and the hip, which are often stressed in the side-sleeping position. Older adults are especially prone to get bed sores owing to their vulnerable skin conditions. The increasing recommendations of these mattresses by healthcare practitioners to avoid post-treatment complexities are driving the growth of the global sleeping aids market.\n\nIncrease in human lifespan and working hours\n\nThe geriatric population is increasing due to the advances in medicine, which is helping people live longer. Countries that have the highest geriatric population include Japan, South Korea, China, Germany, Israel, and the US. The number of people aged 60 years and above is expected to double soon. An increasing number of people prefer to work past the standard retirement age by either launching supplementary careers or working longer because they are not ready for a change. Many nations are raising the age of retirement to reduce the escalating cost of pensions and healthcare for retirees.\n\nMany people experience stress during a normal working week, and it is a major cause of burnout and depression. Also, due to busy schedules, it has become difficult to take out time for exercise and fitness activities. The lack of proper, nutritious meals and increasing workload elevate the level of stress among people. Increased stress levels can raise blood pressure, resulting in faster heartbeats and narrowing of blood vessels. High blood pressure further causes a reduction in blood oxygen levels leading to sleep apnea.\n\n\u201cTo relieve stress, patients use products such as foam pressure-relief mattress and special pillows for uninterrupted sleep and a healthy life. The global sleeping aids market is expected to grow during the forecast period owing to the rising stress and anxiety levels in individuals, prompting the need for sleeping aid products in the future,\u201d says Amber.\n\nBrowse Related Reports:\n\nAbout Technavio\n\nTechnavio is a leading global technology research and advisory company.

Nitrate-rich foods: dark leafy green vegetables, beets, fennel, berries, melons, prunes, figs, dates. (Avoid artificial nitrates or nitrites found in processed meats, which tend create a harmful compound called nitrosamine.)\n\n4. Tea up\n\nTea contains a compound called L-theanine which inhibits the stress hormone, cortisol, as well as aids in the production of GABA, a neurotransmitter that increases dopamine and serotonin. Together these hormones produce a sense of happiness and relaxation. Green tea, chamomile, lavender, peppermint, as well as ginger tea are all great soul-soothing options.\n\n5. Crunch down\n\nResearch shows that the mechanical nature of chomping and chewing can help release tension. Instead of potato chips, let crunchy vegetables, nuts, and seeds serve as an edible stress ball to relieve a clenched jaw.\n\n6. Cut back on caffeine\n\nCaffeine can increase the stress hormone cortisol and heighten the activation of the fight or flight system. There\u2019s no need to ditch your caffeine fix altogether, but reducing your daily intake could be helpful.

The meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya has come under the microscope because Trump Jr. accepted the invitation from British publicist Rob Goldstone after being promised Veselnitskaya would provide incriminating information about Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump Jr. has maintained that it quickly became clear Veselnitskaya had no such information and the meeting revolved around the subject of Russian adoption. He has also said that nothing came of the event and he never followed up with any of the attendees. None of the emails CNN reported on Thursday were sent to Trump Jr. directly, but were instead missives sent by Goldstone to Dan Scavino, then a top aide to the Trump campaign and now the White House's social media director, as well as Ike Kaveladze, a Russian who was present at the meeting.\n\nJust days after the meeting, Goldstone apparently forwarded a message to Kaveladze referencing a report about Russia's breach of the Democratic National Committee. He sent the missive while \"describing the news as 'eerily weird' given what they had discussed at Trump Tower five days earlier,\" CNN reported.\n\nAn attorney for Kaveladze said Kaveladze did receive the email but found it to be \"odd because hacking was never discussed in the meeting,\" CNN wrote. Two sources told CNN that when Trump Jr. published the email chain that resulted in the June 2016 meeting, Kaveladze's son emailed his father asking why Trump Jr. was \"admitting 'collusion,'\" though it is unclear whether the younger Kaveladze was joking.\n\nThe other Goldstone email in question urged Scavino to put then-candidate Donald Trump on the Russian social networking site VX.

They would also provide an explicit path for the nominal housing price index \u2014 giving more detail on how the Fed assumes housing prices and values will be affected in a severely adverse scenario.\n\nThe Fed also proposed that its policy statement be changed to allow for the incorporation of the costs of short-term wholesale funding in adverse and severely adverse scenarios \u2014 a consideration that had not been made in scenarios to date. The proposal said it does not expect such considerations to be included in scenarios \u201cuntil 2020 at the earliest\u201d but wanted to lay the groundwork for their inclusion.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s stress testing regime is widely understood to be among the most consequential post-crisis innovations. It requires all banks with more than $50 billion in assets to submit their balance sheets to the Fed, which examines how those assets would perform under hypothetical future scenarios of varying degrees of economic stress. If banks fail to maintain a minimum capital level throughout each of the scenarios, they can be penalized by blocking their payments of dividends.\n\nBanks have mostly accepted stress testing as part of the regulatory landscape, but have complained about specific aspects of the testing program \u2014 namely the opaqueness with which the scenarios are decided and the opaqueness of the models that assess a bank\u2019s performance through those scenarios.\n\nUntil now, the Fed has been wary of disclosing too much about its models and its scenario design, arguing that if the industry had a more comprehensive knowledge about the models then it could manage its portfolios to achieve the desired stress test results, potentially making the bank appear better capitalized than it really is.\n\nQuarles echoed this sentiment earlier this month, when he said that banks clearly have a vested interest in figuring out what is in the models and are working to reverse-engineer the models all the time.\n\n\u201cThe banks are figuring it out,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are very smart people who have devoted lots of resources to figuring out what\u2019s in the model.\u201d", "image": "https://assets.sourcemedia.com/dims4/default/6b75af9/2147483647/thumbnail/1200x630%3E/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.sourcemedia.com%2Ff2%2F50%2Fe4c0fb8a4246a928ad7ec6b8ad86%2Fquarles-randal-bl-072717.jpg", "subject": "stress"}, "dd405042c172f637f1680b56240d1bc6": {"title": "Fed proposes changes to make US bank stress tests more transparent", "summary": "The proposed tweaks mark a major win for big banks which have for years complained that the Fed&#39;s stress testing process is too opaque, leaving them in the dark over whether they will pass or fail.

But there remains concern at the central bank that giving banks too many specifics about the testing model could render it less effective.\n\nFormer Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo, who built the original stress testing process after the 2007-2009 financial crisis, proposed the idea of creating hypothetical portfolios as a way to give banks some sense of how their portfolios may perform without giving away exactly how the Fed will do the testing.\n\n\u201cA set of hypothetical portfolios ... would permit a fairly accurate inference of the expected losses on any given set of assets. At the same time, they would not permit participants to game the models by scrutinizing them for the precise points where they were weakest,\u201d he said in his farewell remarks in April.\n\nConsumer advocates have argued against giving banks more information on the models, arguing banks could game the system, or risk management in the industry will become focused around a single \u2018mono\u2019 model, potentially increasing concentration risk.\n\nSpeaking during an event in New York on Friday, Quarles dismissed concerns over banks gaming the system, saying over time they would inevitably work out more or less how the models work \u2013 but he did acknowledge concerns over mono models.\n\n\u201cThe proposals that you\u2019ll see coming out from us will be significantly more transparency than we have had \u2013 but not full transparency because we still don\u2019t have an answer in my view to the mono-model risk,\u201d he said.", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20171207&t=2&i=1212930374&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPEDB61UZ", "subject": "stress"}, "e6b117209726fcc9374c778e386f7082": {"title": "Think you&#39;re bad at handling stress?

When stressed, they use up almost all of their energy in an instant by essentially stopping their hearts while thrashing as hard as they can to swim away. It\u2019s one of the most panicked reactions to stress scientists have documented in the animal kingdom.\n\nEvolution has equipped all creatures with the tools to deal with stressors or threats. Sometimes, the body does a quick shot of adrenaline to give itself a rush of super-strength, either for fighting off an enemy or running for the hills. Other times, the body takes the opposite approach and slows itself way down, in theory, so the animal will look dead and a predator will lose interest. In most creatures, these two reactions can\u2019t happen simultaneously because of the way the nervous system is wired.\n\nResearchers previously thought narwhals fell into the latter category. When threatened by a killer whale or another predator, narwhals dive deep, requiring them to lower their heart rates in an effort to save oxygen. However, when researchers tagged five narwhals off the east coast of Greenland with the porpoise equivalent of a Fitbit and trapped them briefly in a net to temporarily stress them out, they found that the animals somehow combine the two common stress reactions. The narwhals end up struggling with every ounce of their strength, while lowering the hearts to between three and four beats per minute. Normally, a narwhal\u2019s resting heart rate at the surface is around 60 beats per minute, based on recordings the team took of nine other narwhals during the experiment. That\u2019s just 5% of their normal average. The findings, from researchers at the University of California- Santa Cruz and the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources, was published (paywall) Dec. 7 in the journal Science.\n\nThe two responses together could potentially strangle the animal\u2019s vital organs; the creature\u2019s body is essentially force its muscles to exert maximum firing power with no fuel. It doesn\u2019t seem like something any creature\u2019s body would be designed to do.\n\nThe authors of the study write that narwhals have likely made it this long despite these apparently maladaptive stress responses because they\u2019re able to escape natural predators by swimming deep beneath them. Once they\u2019ve escaped, they can swim more slowly in the ocean depth, using only about half of the usual oxygen supply, the scientists calculated.\n\nBut the researchers are worried what may happen when shipping, seismic exploration, and fishing in the Arctic become more common as climate change melts sea ice and opens the region up to human activity. If narwhals exert themselves forcefully to try to swim away from pervasive, human-made underwater noise, or get caught up in nets, they may run out of oxygen too quickly to keep their bodies going even at their deep-water, slow-paced swimming. The threat to these creatures won\u2019t be human activities themselves, but rather narwhals\u2019 innate overreactions to it. If we plan to do more in narwhal territory, we\u2019re going to have to figure out how to keep them calm, or else risk the demise of the closest thing nature has to a mystical sea mammal. Luckily, the International Union for Conservation of Nature states that narwhals have a healthy population size at the moment.", "image": "https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/narwhals-horns-stress.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=1600", "subject": "stress"}, "56577bf611be6fc376cda2d2f7938dff": {"title": "Heart monitors on wild narwhals reveal alarming responses to stress", "summary": "But Williams said she worries that the stress from human disturbances could cause behavioral responses in narwhals that are inconsistent with their physiological capacities.

Credit: M.P. Heide-Jorgensen Narwhals released after entanglement in nets and outfitted with heart monitors performed a series of deep dives, swimming hard to escape, while their heart rates dropped to unexpectedly low levels of three to four beats per minute. This combination of hard exercise and low heart rate while not breathing under water is costly and could make it difficult for the deep-diving whales to get enough oxygen to the brain and other critical organs, according to a new study.\n\n\"How do you run away while holding your breath? These are deep-diving marine mammals, but we were not seeing normal dives during the escape period. I have to wonder how narwhals protect their brains and maintain oxygenation in this situation,\" said Terrie Williams, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz who has studied exercise physiology in a wide range of marine and terrestrial mammals.\n\nWilliams is first author of a paper on the new findings published December 8 in Science. Narwhals, known as \"unicorns of the sea\" for the large tusks on the males, live year-round in Arctic waters. They have been relatively isolated from human disturbances until recently, when declines in Arctic sea ice have made the region more accessible to shipping, oil exploration, and other human activities.\n\nNarwhals monitored after release gradually returned to more typical behavior and normal heart rates. But Williams said she worries that the stress from human disturbances could cause behavioral responses in narwhals that are inconsistent with their physiological capacities. Their natural escape response to avoid killer whales and other threats typically involves moving slowly either to great depths or into shallow coastal areas beneath ice cover where killer whales can't follow. \"This is not a speedy animal,\" she explained.\n\nHeart rate monitor used in this study on the back of a narwhal. Credit: M.P. Heide-Jorgensen\n\nA decreased heart rate (called bradycardia) is a normal part of the mammalian dive response, along with other physiological changes to conserve oxygen. In narwhals, the researchers measured resting heart rates at the surface of about 60 beats per minute. During normal dives (after the escape period), their heart rates dropped to between 10 and 20 beats per minute, depending on exercise level. Heart rate normally rises with increased exercise, even during a dive.\n\n\"That's what is so paradoxical about this escape response\u2014it seems to cancel out the exercise response and maintains extreme bradycardia even when the whales are exercising hard,\" Williams said.\n\nThe extremely low heart rates that Williams observed in fleeing narwhals are similar to those seen in animals with a \"freeze reaction,\" one of two mutually exclusive responses animals can have to perceived threats, the other being a \"fight or flight\" response that revs up heart rate and metabolism. The narwhals, in their response to a stressful situation, seem to combine elements of a physiological freeze reaction with a behavioral flight reaction, with potentially harmful consequences.\n\n\"For terrestrial mammals, these opposing signals to the heart can be problematic,\" Williams said. \"Escaping marine mammals are trying to integrate a dive response on top of an exercise response on top of a fear response. This is a lot of physiological balancing, and I wonder if deep-diving marine mammals are designed to deal with three different signals coming to the heart at the same time.\"\n\nImmature male narwhal resting in shallow water in Scoresby Sound, Greenland. Its heart narwhal heart rate pulse of 60 beats per minute can be heard on the audio as well as some breathing sounds. Credit: T.M. Williams\n\nThe same phenomenon may occur in other deep-diving whales when they are disturbed by human-generated noise in the oceans, which has been associated with strandings of deep-diving cetaceans such as beaked whales, she said.\n\n\"The disorientation often reported during strandings of deep-diving whales makes me think something has gone wrong with their cognitive centers,\" Williams said. \"Could this result from a failure to maintain normal oxygenation of the brain?\"\n\nShe calculated that the escape dives her team monitored in narwhals required 97 percent of the animal's oxygen supply and often exceeded its aerobic dive limit (meaning depletion of oxygen stores in the muscles, lungs, and blood, followed by anaerobic metabolism). Normal dives of similar duration and depth used only about 52 percent of a narwhal's oxygen store, the study found.\n\nThe study was conducted in Scoresby Sound on the east coast of Greenland, where coauthor Mads Peter Heide-J\u00f8rgensen, a research professor at the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources, has been studying narwhals since 2012. Native hunters in the area set out nets to catch fish, seals, and other animals, including narwhals. Heide-J\u00f8rgensen developed a collaboration with the hunters to allow scientists to tag and release narwhals caught in the nets. He has been using satellite tags to study the movements of the East Greenland narwhal population.\n\nTeam release of a male narwhal with a heart rate monitor (in yellow). Credit: T.M. Williams\n\nWilliams's group at UC Santa Cruz developed unique tagging technology for marine mammals that enables researchers to monitor exercise physiology during dives by recording electrocardiograms, swimming movements (stroke rates), and other data. The tags function much like the Fitbits people use to monitor their daily activities. For this study, resting heart rate was measured in nine narwhals, and five were monitored during dives after release. The instruments were attached to the narwhals with suction cups and fell off after one to three days, floating to the surface where they could be recovered by the scientists.\n\nIn previous studies, Williams has used the instruments to study exercise physiology and dive responses in bottlenose dolphins, Weddell seals, and other species. \"This was our first opportunity to put the tags on a deep-diving whale to monitor its physiological and behavioral responses,\" Williams said. \"It all began with the work on dolphins in our facilities at Long Marine Laboratory.\"\n\nAmong the findings of her earlier studies was a surprising frequency of heart arrhythmias in dolphins and seals during intense exercise at depth. The new findings add to her concerns about the effects of disturbances that cause an escape response in deep-diving marine mammals.\n\n\"Unlike threats from predators like killer whales, noise from sonar or a seismic explosion is difficult to escape. Problems can start if the whales try to outrun it,\" Williams said. \"The implications of this study are cautionary, showing that the biology of these animals makes them especially vulnerable to disturbance. This technology has given us a window into the narwhal's world, and what we see is alarming. The question is, what are we as humans going to do about it?\"\n\nExplore further: Heart arrhythmias detected in deep-diving marine mammals\n\nMore information: T.M.

What about stress over the news, or could it be relationship strain? Before you get too stressed about trying to guess which one it is, the answer is actually pretty obvious: money.\n\nThat\u2019s right, according to researchers at the medical school at the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa, your financial problems could literally kill you. \u201cSignificant financial stress is associated with a 13-fold higher odds of having a heart attack,\u201d stated the group of researchers that carried out a study looking at links between stress and heart problems.\n\nPresented by the European Society of Cardiology at the 18th Annual Congress of the South African Heart Association, the study looked at heart attack patients at a major hospital in Johannesburg and assessed their stress levels. \u201cOur study suggests that psychosocial aspects are important risk factors for acute myocardial infarction [heart attack],\u201d concluded Dr. Denishan Govender, an associate lecturer and lead author of the study.\n\nThe study was relatively small and included just 212 participants. Half were hospitalized and recovering from recent heart attacks. The other half were a control group of other patients at the same hospital, but with no serious heart problems.\n\nThe researchers found an overwhelming majority (96 percent) of the heart attack patients had reported significant levels of stress in the month leading up to their hospitalization. Around 40 percent reported severe levels of stress. Different stress levels were determined using the Likert scale to categorize and compare the individual experiences of each patient.\n\n\u201cRegarding financial stress, patients were graded with no financial stress if they were coping financially, mild financial stress if they were coping financially but needed added support,\u201d researchers explained. While moderate financial stress was tied to patients with reasonable income but high expenses, the worst level of stress was reserved for those with \u201cno income and at times struggled to meet basic needs.\u201d\n\nWork stress comes in second place\n\nPatients in that last category were the only ones to experience the whopping 13-fold increase in heart attack risk, though researchers noted any stress can be bad for your health. In particular, the second most notable source of stress was the workplace. According to the study, patients with \u201cmoderate or severe work stress\u201d are 5.6 times more likely to have a heart attack than those with \u201cminimal or no stress.\u201d\n\nHowever, even at the higher end of the spectrum, work-related stress was barely half as dangerous for your heart as financial woes. The authors argued the results should be a wake-up call to patients and doctors alike, particularly general practitioners. According to Govender, stress should be put on the same level as cigarette smoking during routine check-ups.\n\n\u201cFew doctors ask about stress, depression or anxiety during a general physical and this should become routine practice, like asking about smoking,\u201d he said. \u201cJust as we provide advice on how to quit smoking, patients need information on how to fight stress,\u201d he argued.\n\nStress: a national crisis?\n\nAlmost three-quarters of Americans suffer some kind of financial stress, according to a 2015 study by the American Psychological Association. That same study found over one in four American adults suffer financial stress \u201cmost or all of the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Great Recession may have officially ended, but most American households face stagnant wages and increasing debt \u2014 many Americans are actually considered to be poorer than they were a decade ago,\u201d researchers noted, after finding financial problems aren\u2019t just making us sick; they\u2019re also making it harder for us to deal with being sick.\n\nWhile a third of participants admitted money problems made a \u201chealthy lifestyle\u201d difficult or impossible to maintain, one in five said they \u201cconsidered skipping (9 percent) or skipped (12 percent) going to the doctor in the past year when they needed health care because of financial concerns.\u201d\n\nBack in South Africa, Professor Pravin Manga said prevention and psychological health care is better than trying to cure the plethora of problems that can crop up down the track. \u201cThere is growing recognition that many developing countries are experiencing an increasing prevalence of chronic diseases of lifestyle such as myocardial infarction [heart attack],\u201d Manga said.\n\n\u201cOur study shows that psychosocial aspects are an area of cardiovascular prevention that deserves more attention,\u201d he stated.\n\nHow to handle stress\n\nIf you\u2019re suffering from high levels of stress, the U.K.\u2019s National Health Service has a helpful checklist of ways you can improve your mental health.\n\nSome of the highlights include taking on an exercise regime, or finding people you can confide in. If that doesn\u2019t help, try reading over this long list of scientifically proven ways to lower stress levels. It likewise includes some obvious behaviors like meditation, art and music. However, it also features some other less orthodox but reliable ideas, such as sex, self-hypnosis and chewing gum (presumably not at the same time, though). If you\u2019d rather something stronger than gum, in low doses marijuana is also proven to reduce stress, while psilocybin (the active ingredient in magic mushrooms) has also been shown to reduce stress and depression while improving overall mood.\n\n\u2014 Ryan Mallett-Outtrim", "image": "https://cdn.thealternativedaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/thiscommontypeofstresscanliterallygiveyouaheartattack_featured_960x540-1.jpg", "subject": "stress"}, "d7b156074192025e35c958ec178c0700": {"title": "Guided imagery and mindfulness to thwart stress", "summary": "Stress can affect anyone one of us at any time, but the holidays seem to take the cake when it comes to being frazzled.

Thankfully, you have inexpensive options that don\u2019t even involve leaving the house to help keep you calm and able to enjoy every moment as it comes.\n\nGuided imagery\n\nThere are two parts to the human mind - the conscious and subconscious -explained Gail Elliott Patricolo, director of Integrative Medicine at Beaumont.\n\n\u201cThe conscious mind is the verbal mind, which can be the irritating \u2018monkey mind\u2019 constantly chattering, where the subconscious mind is quiet and can\u2019t talk back,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause they are connected to your nervous system, when the monkey mind is chattering away, you can feel tense and your \u2018fight or flight\u2019 response kicks in, which can be harmful to your health, if you stay there too long.\u201d\n\nGuided imagery is a great way to ward off the effects of stress. Best of all, it\u2019s easy to do at home, at the office or in a quiet area where you can take a few minutes for yourself.\n\n\u201cListening to a guided imagery tool over and over, gives you the ability to help yourself. We need tools we can draw on ourselves, so finding one that\u2019s right for you is important. There are CDs, apps, such as Insight Timer, as well as websites you can use.\u201d\n\nMindfulness\n\nMindfulness is another inexpensive, easy accessible way to refocus and enjoy the moment.\n\n\u201cThe idea is to notice when the mind wanders off,\u201d said Lucy Sternburgh, Ph.D., mindfulness-based stress reduction teacher at Beaumont. \u201cIf we\u2019re replaying situations of the past in our minds, we\u2019re wandering off. When the mind gets into planning mode of rehearsing what hasn\u2019t happened yet, it can cause a sense of anxiety.\"\n\n\n\nSo, the benefit of being aware of the present moment, is you might notice a sense of being a little less stuck in the past, less anticipation about the future, and you can be a little more accepting of things just the way they are right now.\n\n\u201cGenerally, the most common technique of practicing mindfulness is to be aware of the breath. Breathing with awareness and noticing it. It doesn\u2019t have to be anything special. We can use it as an anchor to the present moment because we can\u2019t breathe in the past or the future, we are breathing right now,\u201d added Sternburgh.\n\n\u201cOne of the best things you can do is breathe properly - slow diaphragmatic breathing. Most of us run around all day taking short, shallow breaths. Take a few deep breaths and you automatically move yourself out of the stress response,\u201d Patricolo agreed.", "image": "https://www.beaumont.org/images/default-source/news/holiday-stress50080109149c6502a29dff00004a72eb.jpg?sfvrsn=0", "subject": "stress"}, "3d6df4fa5db54664ab9a67c7ceb2d4f1": {"title": "Anxiety and panic attacks are leaving thousands of children feeling trapped and even struggling to ...", "summary": "Counselling sessions about anxiety have risen by 59% over the past two years.

You may feel uneasy about how you can help, but try not to let this show. Stay calm and acknowledge the person\u2019s feelings, with words such as, \u201cI can see you are feeling this way. Would you like to talk about it?\u201d Ask curious, non-threatening questions.\n\n2. Try to really understand how they are feeling. Younger children may find it hard to explain their anxiety, so asking them to draw a picture of themselves to illustrate the emotion may help. Naming the feeling often helps.\n\n3. Be on their side \u2013 use words such as, \u201cLet\u2019s talk about what we can do about this\u201d. Be on their side physically too \u2013 you might find they talk more easily when walking side by side, as opposed to sitting face to face, for example.\n\n4. Be empathetic (not sympathetic), and non-judgemental \u2013 something that makes a young person anxious may seem trivial to you, but huge to them.\n\n(Thinkstock/PA)\n\n5. Use positive body language \u2013 and recognise what is appropriate use of touch. A reassuring hand on a shoulder may make one young person feel supported, but could make another feel more anxious.\n\n6. Do explain they are not alone. Reassure them that other people have anxiety and that the physical sensations they are experiencing \u2013 sweating, dry mouth, racing heart \u2013 are normal in an anxious situation.\n\n7. Encourage the use of coping strategies \u2013 deep mindful breathing, going for a walk, noticing their own feelings and paying attention, etc.\n\n8. Recognise your limitations \u2013 there are many forms of anxiety in children and young people. Some anxiety is temporary but some anxiety might be longer term and harder for someone to cope with, and may be beyond the help you can offer. You might need to signpost to professional help. Of course, some anxiety could be linked to specific phobias or situations.\n\n\u00a9 Press Association 2017", "image": "https://93546-d-c.ooyala.com/content/images/1122/1512730988_f6d9d159-7ede-4690-b127-b1eb7257c2d1_636x357.jpg", "subject": "mental health"}, "008dfd9efe88fd10355b86d92739a3db": {"title": "Seven tips for party phobics: how to get through Christmas and New Year festivities", "summary": "\u201cWorries about how you look on top of pre-existing nerves, will only heighten your anxiety.

About 13 per cent of people will develop it at some point in their life, psychologist Dr Tess Browne says.\n\nBrowne, who runs her TalkSpace Psychology service out of Hong Kong\u2019s Central Minds Clinic, says the anticipation can be even worse than being at a festive event.\n\n\u201cRepeatedly thinking about the potential future negative outcomes of social interactions, which psychologists refer to as anticipatory rumination, can heighten emotional distress and physiological symptoms of anxiety, before even stepping foot in a party,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cDistracting yourself from unhelpful thoughts via involvement in an engaging activity, focusing only on factors you can control, or mindful meditation can all be useful strategies to help reduce pre-party rumination.\u201d\n\nPrep positively pre party\n\nWear something that makes you feel comfortable and confident, Browne advises. \u201cWorries about how you look on top of pre-existing nerves, will only heighten your anxiety. Now is not the time to experiment with a new hairstyle or look \u2013 save that for when you are feeling generally more confident about attending parties. And practise calm breathing while you\u2019re getting ready,\u201d she says, adding Smartphone apps, such as Headspace or Calm, offer brief guided mindful meditations to help you relax.\n\nShow you care by showing up\n\nCaroline Goyder, a British public speaking coach and author of The Star Qualities and Gravitas, acknowledges parties can be a challenge for introverts, but that is no excuse to turn invitations down.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to the big occasions, such as the company year-end party, this won\u2019t do. Unless you have a cast-iron excuse not to go, no matter how shy you feel, you need to make the effort.\u201d Showing up shows you care.\n\nBrowne says avoiding situations you feel anxious about is the wrong approach. \u201cThis actually maintains social anxiety as it prevents your worst fears from being disconfirmed. Facing your fear head on, repeatedly, across different social situations if possible, will gradually help to reduce your fears. Approaching, rather than avoiding, chatting to people is critical. This will understandably feel uncomfortable at first, but over time, with repeated practice, will get easier.\u201d\n\nChunk it down\n\nOnce you\u2019ve psyched yourself up, how to get through the front door? Actors terrified of premieres are taught to go in imagining that they only have to stay for five minutes. Then you can cope as you walk into the room, because you can leave soon if you need to. And because you tell yourself you are only staying for a short time, you make the effort to go up to people and say hello. And once you\u2019re in, you start to enjoy yourself, and five minutes becomes five hours. Hong Kong psychologist Dr Sue Jamieson, of Integrative Medical Practice in Central, calls this \u201cchunking it down\u201d. \u201cMake a plan to only go for 15 minutes. Actually look at your watch,\u201d she says. \u201cTell yourself, \u2018You can do this\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe more exposure you have to social interactions at parties, the quicker you will combat your anxiety\n\nDr Tess Browne, psychologist\n\nThink positively\n\nOnce you have arrived, says Dr Browne, \u201cthere are several strategies you can try to help manage anxiety. Trying to challenge negative thoughts about how you think you are interacting, or how others might be perceiving you can be helpful. Asking yourself questions such as: what\u2019s the evidence that what I am thinking is accurate? Is there any evidence to suggest an alternative explanation? Are there any strengths or positives in the situation that I am ignoring? Using the answers to such questions to generate a more accurate realistic interpretation, can help reduce feelings of anxiety.\u201d\n\nTurn the lights on\n\nScientists have discovered there\u2019s a physiological reason why genuine warmth and positivity has such a good effect on others. When they compared electrical activity, the signals between one person\u2019s heart and another\u2019s brain had a measurable effect on each other and you kick-start it by projecting outwards. Who needs another drink? Who needs to be brought into the conversation? Ask questions if you don\u2019t know what to say, maintain eye contact, laugh at jokes, don\u2019t cross your arms (this reads as keep out) and smile, smile, smile: Psychologists call this the \u2018spotlight effect\u2019. Australian actress Cate Blanchett calls it \u2018turning the lights on\u2019. As people warm to you, you\u2019ll warm up and the more engaged you are, the more you\u2019ll enjoy your evening.\n\nEngaging conversation\n\nPrepare and practise small talk so you have something to say. People love to talk about themselves, so ask questions about their lives or what they do, or admire what they are wearing. A little bit of flattery goes a long way.\n\nBrowne recommends directing conversations towards topics which you feel knowledgeable about, \u201cor recruiting the support of a friend who knows you suffer with anxiety, and asking them to direct the chat to subjects you feel comfortable with. Focusing your attention on the conversation, and others\u2019 responses, rather than your own responses or any physical symptoms of anxiety you might be feeling, can also help you feel engaged and competent.\u201d\n\nPractice makes perfect, she suggests. \u201cThe more exposure you have to social interactions at parties, the quicker you will combat your anxiety.\u201d", "image": "https://cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/620x356/public/images/methode/2017/12/08/7db96a14-db0d-11e7-91af-f34de211f924_image_hires_142124.JPG?itok=kvr0Wczs", "subject": "anxiety"}, "075b8a7bcf53b036601790abfb222d4c": {"title": "US Anxiety Disorder Market Research Report, 2016-2022", "summary": "According to the report, The U.S. demand for general anxiety disorder market was valued at USD 3,251 million in 2014 and is expected to generate revenue of USD 3,775 million by end of 2020, growing at a CAGR of 2.4% between 2015 and 2020.

But, for children whose symptoms persist or get worse it is vital they have access to professional support and treatment.\n\nHowever, some young people have told Childline they do not fit the criteria for Children and Mental Health Support (CAMHS), or have been left on their waiting list for months.\n\nA 17-year-old girl told Childline: \u201cI suffer with anxiety and panic attacks and find it difficult to leave the house. I was referred to CAMHS but I was on a waiting list for 8 months and during that time my anxiety got worse so I never went because I was too scared.\n\n\u201cEvery day feels impossible and so difficult and I know I need help but the thought of having to sit there and talk openly, having to revisit old memories and thoughts with a stranger terrifies me.\u201d\n\nYoung people have also experienced challenges at home in getting help, with some having their anxiety dismissed by parents as an overreaction or a passing phase.\n\nIn some counselling sessions young people are able to identify triggers for their anxiety such as starting a new school, moving to a new area or upcoming exams; but many don\u2019t think there is any reason for their feelings.\n\nOne 16-year-old girl said to counsellors: \u201cRecently I\u2019ve been feeling anxious and the smallest things make me feel scared. I don\u2019t understand because nothing has happened to trigger it. I\u2019ve just been feeling worse and worse lately.

It is a feeling affecting adults and children alike. But while adults have the maturity to understand the nature of the pressures affecting them and how to cope, for children it is often a very different story.\n\nAs the Childline charity reports in this newspaper today, the number of young people contacting it with feelings of anxiety has reached record levels in Northern Ireland and resulted in an increase in counselling sessions.\n\nThere are the expected triggers which affect growing youngsters - relationships, upcoming examinations and peer pressure. But cyber bullying is a growing and insidious development that can have tragic results, as can be seen from even a cursory glance at recent media reports.\n\nSocial media has turned life for many young people into a goldfish bowl where their every move, anxiety, relationship, or home or school life, is often laid bare for all to see. There is a pressure to conform to the norm, but social media also gives the closet bullies free range to vent their bile.\n\nThe remedy for this pressure on young people might seem obvious: simply get off social media or cut back on the information posted. But for a young person wanting to interact with his or her peers that would seem a step too far.\n\nYet many young people realise the results of the pressures that come to bear on them. Saying they suffer from anxiety, or even require counselling, does not do full justice to what they are experiencing. Many talk about having panic attacks, even as they make the phone call to seek help.\n\nAnd for a young person, opening up to a parent or relation, never mind a stranger, about the traumas in their lives can be difficult. They are left with a feeling of helplessness, not quite sure where to turn. They are not helped by parents or relations who regard their problems as just a phase that will pass.\n\nThe young people under pressure are fortunate that a charity like Childline exists and that its reputation is such that many feel secure enough to turn to it for help. Trust for young people is a very fragile thing.\n\nOf course, most parents will try to help their children, but with their own busy lives in many instances they are often unaware of what is happening in their own home. Making time for our children must be the priority in today's very challenging world.\n\nBelfast Telegraph", "image": "https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article36389184.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/lonely.jpg", "subject": "anxiety"}, "5432430641627ad3581ef370310b4e3b": {"title": "Disturbed Sleep May Up Depression Risk, Try These Herbs to Curb The Symptoms!", "summary": "If you have been experiencing quite a few days of sleeping disorders, there is a chance you may develop the symptoms of depression.

According to a study conducted by University of Pittsburgh in the US, teenagers dealing with sleep deprivation may indulge more in risk-taking behaviour and addictions. This is because chronic sleep deprivation reduces the proper functioning of putamen- an area of the brain that plays a vital role in goal based movements and learning from rewards. Lack of proper sleep also leads to less activity in the brain's reward system.\n\nFor the research, the team studied the sleeping behavior of participants aged between 11 to 15 years. The team divided the total participants in two groups and allowed one group to sleep for four hours while the rest completed 10 hours of sleep. While noting the MRI scans of the participants each time the team repeated the same sleeping patterns and interchanged it in between the groups. While in rest condition, the brain region did not show any difference between high and low reward conditions. After a night of restricted sleep, the participants who experienced less activation in the putamen also reported more symptoms of depression.\n\nDepression has become a common condition nowadays. Its symptoms may include stress, anxiety and overthinking. Here are some herbs that may help curbing these symptoms, if the not the condition completely.\n\n1. Ashwagandha\n\nAshwagandha is one of the best treatments for anxiety and stress; it is believed to relieve both the symptoms due to the presence of active compounds like steroidal lactones, saponins, alkaloids and withanolides that provide antidepressant, anti-inflammatory and anti-anxiety properties.\n\n2. Brahmi\n\nBrahmi has an age old reputation of relieving stress. Brahmi acts as an adaptogen that simply means it helps the body adapt to new or stressful situations. When consumed, it is believed to up the serotonin levels in the brain that help the mind keep calm.\n\n3. Jatamasi\n\nJatamasi has anti-depressant and anti-stress properties. The roots of jatamasi are used for the medicinal purposes in Ayurveda which are known to give a therapeutic effect to mood swings and stress disorders.\n\n4. Pudina\n\nPudina has been used for centuries to cure nervous system disorders due to the presence of menthol as it helps calm the frazzled nerves and has a cooling effect.", "image": "https://i.ndtvimg.com/i/2017-08/red-wine-effective-in-curing-depression_650x400_71503916265.jpg", "subject": "depression"}, "c1b456cc799f03069eac3e2abcf309ef": {"title": "Anxiety in Ekiti over condition of abducted senator", "summary": "There is concern in Oye-Ekiti, headquarters of Oye Local Government Area of Ekiti State, about the continued abduction of their illustrious son, Senator Ayodele Arise.

You\u2019re excited about your trip, looking forward to relaxing, reconnecting with loved ones or sightseeing. Then there\u2019s the other side of travel: going through security, presenting your papers, being searched, hoping you remembered all the rules and that you don\u2019t get bumped or charged extra for your bag. Sometimes there are additional fears about destinations \u2014 worries about potential emergencies, whether a wildfire, blizzard or act of terror \u2014 that causes havoc on the ground.\n\nThe travel industry media company Skift devoted its annual journal to the theme of Travel in the Age of Permanxiety. Skift CEO Rafat Ali recently spoke about the topic in an interview for the AP Travel podcast Get Outta Here! Here are some excerpts:\n\nQ: What is permanxiety?\n\nA: We coined this term permanxiety, which is essentially a short form of permanent anxiety. It\u2019s this constant state of anxiety ... that pervades every part of our lives today, whether it\u2019s politics, social media, our daily lives commuting, whether it\u2019s listening to news and how that then translates into the anxieties that show up when we travel.\n\nTo reduce anxiety, it\u2019s good to be informed about every part of your journey. (Shutterstock)\n\nQ: Is there anything travel providers can do to compensate for all the negative things we experience or anticipate when we travel?\n\nA: The travel industry markets itself as a sensory deprivation bubble. I think it\u2019s done a disservice to itself by separating from the realities of the world. Travel is the world\u2019s largest industry. Let\u2019s start acting like it. We are enmeshed in every big sector, every big geopolitical issue. Why run away from it? ... There are those outside issues the travel industry warns against, but the daily-ness of the anxieties, it doesn\u2019t warn against or doesn\u2019t do enough to soothe the anxieties of the traveller.\n\nIn many ways, a lot of travel brands have latched onto tech and digital in general as a shortcut, but in many cases that exacerbates anxieties. A lot of travel brands say, \u2018We\u2019re adding a lot of digital and hopefully that will solve everything\u2019. But it turns out what they need is humans at the other end of it. Every part of our travel these days is primarily about the lack of human touch or nobody listening to us on the other end.\n\nQ: Is there anything travellers can do to reduce their own anxiety?\n\nA: It\u2019s good to be informed about every part of your journey, (for example if) you\u2019ve never flown through the New York airports \u2014 you\u2019re going to be in for a huge shock. My cousin literally landed here for the first time ever and I told him, \u2018I know you\u2019re saying this is so much worse than India (where he lives) because it is.\u2019 Being informed at least gives you the right context when you travel. That may potentially increase anxieties but at least you\u2019re informed enough to make an informed decision.\n\nQ: The journal includes an essay you wrote about travelling as a Muslim, with a Muslim name, and about being perceived as the \u201cabstract villain\u201d of everyone else\u2019s collective and imagined anxieties. So in addition to the travel anxieties we all have, you are also burdened with our reaction to you.\n\nA: I\u2019m an educated, successful entrepreneur, an epitome in some sense of the American dream. Imagine a lot of people who don\u2019t have the privilege I\u2019ve gained over my life. Not that I face all of these in every bit of my travel every time I travel. This is an amalgamation of the challenges (such as) ... when you\u2019re booking things online, something was triggered because of my Muslim name. Or whether it\u2019s getting to the airport, worrying about why TSA is staring you down or scribbling something on your ticket. ...\n\nWhen you board the flight as a Muslim, one of the examples I gave in the essay, if I am calling my wife to say that I am fine, I boarded, everything is fine, I don\u2019t want to say something in Arabic because there are real cases of people on the plane reporting somebody speaking Arabic. It\u2019s just a language! I\u2019m sure different minorities in their own ways have their own anxieties ... travelling while black or travelling with a physical disability.\n\nQ: Is social media a force for good or evil when it comes to travel in the age of permanxiety?\n\nA: I do feel that it exacerbates our anxieties. It is an addiction. ... We are hyperventilating, checking all kinds of news, all kinds of bad stuff happening out there. We internalise it. It shows up in our travel. Any small issue that happens probably gets overplayed as a result of social media.\n\nFollow @htlifeandstyle for more", "image": "http://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2017/12/07/Pictures/_c8502888-db3f-11e7-9b6d-9e5c5485959d.jpg", "subject": "anxiety"}, "133909aff0ad9ba1167a6dd4ad059d53": {"title": "Singer Lights comes out as bisexual and opens up about how her album helped address her ...", "summary": "Singer Lights comes out as bisexual and opens up about how her album helped address her depression ...

New research finds that accessing data from electronic medical records could greatly benefit this practice.\n\nPersonalised medicine has been one of the most promising medical developments in recent years and this entails determining which patients will benefit from various treatments.\n\nA new study from Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Harvard University finds that using data from electronic medical records in those models could hold a lot of promise.\n\nDepression is a condition that is notoriously difficult to treat, with patients often having to try several different medications before finding an effective one.\n\nResearchers \u2013 MGH\u2019s Roy Perlis and Harvard\u2019s Finale Doshi-Velez, joined by postdoctoral researcher Michael Hughes \u2013 examined large amounts of electronic data from the medical records of over 50,000 people with depression. By applying machine learning they were able to sort the data into depression subtypes \u2013 represented by clusters of symptoms and features highlighted by the data, such as age, sexual dysfunction, weight gain, or obesity.\n\nDoshi-Velez\u2018s team also looked at 16 types of antidepressants that were ultimately successful in treating the patients\u2019 depression. From these data, they were able to develop an algorithm to predict an antidepressant\u2019s effectiveness based on depression subtypes.\n\nWhen implemented in clinical settings, the new tool was found to be more accurate than existing methods. In addition, the clinicians polled by the researchers said they found the tool more user-friendly than existing predictive models.\n\nAs there is a 50 percent failure rate among patients trying a first treatment for depression, and a 50 percent failure rate among those who try a second type of treatment, cutting down the inherent guesswork could be life-changing.\n\nCommenting on the value of more accurately pinpointing an effective treatment for patients, Doshi-Velez said: \u201cEach try can take multiple weeks to assess, while you\u2019re playing around with dosages. And these are already people for whom morale is sapped. Even if we could make a modest improvement \u2013 for instance, one less try \u2013 this could be a very significant result.\u201d\n\nWhile the researchers focused their study on mining records on depression, the method could apply more broadly to help patients with a variety of health problems \u2013 an exciting proposition for the industry and sufferers alike.", "image": "https://www.europeanpharmaceuticalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/depression-1.jpg", "subject": "depression"}, "016af54cbd9acbc2a7a88c2144250a44": {"title": "Where to find light in the darkness of depression", "summary": "He got her a year ago to help him with his depression - routine and responsibility work wonders.

He got her a year ago to help him with his depression - routine and responsibility work wonders. When GQ gets there at 4pm, Lyla's sleeping on his lap. Edwards, drinking lemonade, is nervous. \"It's still massively a work in progress,\" he says of his current condition, glancing over. \"Just knowing I'm doing this, meeting you... I've been in a bit of a state all day.\" The day after he first wrote about his depression on Facebook, in May 2016, he wrote a public blog post. He was going to be cycling around and climbing up Mount Snowdon, then kayaking for 4km, to raise money for mental health charity Mind and needed to explain why. He'd wanted to do a positive post, but when it came to it, he couldn't. \"I'm low,\" he wrote. \"Lower than a snake's belly. I cannot cope.\"\n\nAccording to the recent Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey conducted by NatCen Social Research for NHS Digital, one in six adults surveyed in England met the criteria of a common social disorder. This, consultant psychiatrist Lenny Cornwall tells GQ, takes in a wide range of issues, including anxiety, OCD, panic and depression - but many more of us could be affected at some point in our lives. \"Everybody will have had an experience when, looking back on it, they may say it was a pretty bad time,\" says Cornwall. \"If you look at whether you've had a mental health problem at any time in your life, it's probably more like one in two people.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecently, after a decade of physical and mental suffering, Edwards was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, which has led to depression. In retrospect, he says, his anxiety was born ten years ago, when he became a policeman in Hackney. He didn't realise it then, but he was being bullied at work by a senior member of staff who, he says, made his life hell. This resulted in irritable bowel syndrome, which was enormously disruptive. Eventually he had a couple of breakdowns: one saw him smashing his car up while he was driving and then, at work, \"I ripped my clothes off; had a full-blown anxiety attack. I couldn't do my job. I needed serious help. After that I was off work for nearly a year. Things got a lot worse before they started to get better.\"\n\n76% of UK suicides are male - it's the biggest killer of men under 50\n\nHis breakdowns, he says now, stemmed from years of emotional denial. As a policeman, due to his steely demeanour, he'd often be the one sent out to deal with heavy situations. It was the same in his personal life - people would come to him with problems, because he \"never got wound up, never got upset, never got angry, never got excited. I'd shoved everything in a box for so long and now it was trying to get out.\" His parents split up when he was 16; later his mother told him he didn't cry, just took it on the chin. \"I was like, 'Whatever. Getting upset isn't going to help me.' But it turns out it would have done!\"\n\nRead next Get insider access to Art Basel Miami Beach with super DJ Guy Gerber Get insider access to Art Basel Miami Beach with super DJ Guy Gerber Get exclusive insider access to Art Basel Miami with Israeli DJing legend Guy Gerber, see our Bossman Birdie and Diztortion video premiere and find out which musicians GQ is loving right now\n\nDuring her speech to the Charity Commission in January, Theresa May proposed plans to transform attitudes to mental health, aware that it is \"dangerously disregarded\" as secondary to physical health. \"If you have a mental health problem, people are more likely to try to avoid you,\" she said. Edwards has had extreme experience of this. \"As police officers we deal with mental health every day,\" he says. \"You've got drug addicts, missing persons, people with bipolar, all day, every day. People describe them as nutjobs, so for anybody else to say that maybe they've got some of those problems, you just automatically get put in that box. Someone will turn up in an office role and everyone's always like, 'Oh, what are they doing there? They've gone a bit wibble.'\"\n\nIstock\n\nNaturally, this attitude does not encourage openness. Edwards believed that showing his emotions would be a weakness, so for years he never did. After his breakdowns came horrific bouts of self-harm, some of which, he says, were a way of communicating how much trouble he was in, because he didn't know how to talk about it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"People can be worried about opening up for fear of another person's reaction,\" says Cornwall. \"Even I have patients who say to me, 'I didn't want to tell you that because I thought you might be cross with me.' That just doesn't happen! The important step forward is for the person to think about what they're doing and talk to somebody about it, but somebody who's not going to panic about it or be judgemental. Helplines such as the Samaritans' can be great as a way to talk to somebody about it in a useful way.\"\n\nThere were 6,188 suicides in the UK in 2015, an increase on 2014\n\nRead next The best technology gifts for men The best technology gifts for men The best technology and gadget gift ideas for men in 2017\n\nAfter trying to strangle himself with a T-shirt in bed one night - thankfully thwarted by his wife - Edwards went to his GP and was prescribed antidepressants, which had a temporarily positive effect. Then, though, came more self-harm, a return trip to the GP and some different drugs. Transitioning between antidepressants created awful side effects, but finally last summer he saw a psychiatrist who prescribed him something that helped substantially.\n\n\"The trouble,\" says Cornwall, \"is that medications can be very effective, but the science isn't there to say who's going to respond to what. There's a lot of trial and error to find something that's going to work. It's a discussion that has to be had at the outset - it's going to be a difficult process to get to what's going to work for you. If a person knows that, then they're more likely to put up with side effects in the hope it gets somewhere.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSearching for a better way to express his pain than self-harm, Edwards finally started to talk about how he felt and then write about it. \"People knew I was ill,\" he wrote on his blog last September, \"so I didn't have to show them any more.\" Opening up has helped immeasurably. \"Before, if I felt something, I would suppress it,\" he says. \"But what helps me is the opposite - talking about it is how I cope with it.\" He's also decided that police work is not for him. There's still a long way to go, but today he seems healthy, happy - and talkative.\n\nIstock\n\nCornwall believes that people today are communicating more about their mental health issues. \"I think the stigma is going down,\" he says. \"People are in the media talking about what's happened to them, and that helps people, undoubtedly.\" Indeed, millennials are highly vocal on the subject. While promoting his debut album, grime artist Stormzy spoke to Channel 4 about his experiences with depression, which he documented through song. \"The NatCen Social Research data shows the proportion of people who have got a significant problem and are getting help,\" continues Cornwall. \"In 2009, it was 30 per cent. In 2014, it was 45 per cent. So it's got better, but it's still bad.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a police officer, feeling that he needed to be the embodiment of strength, Edwards found it tough to talk, to the point of denial - but such trepidation affects many of us. \"Sometimes,\" says Cornwall, \"telling independently minded men - or women - who consider themselves the type of person who sorts their own problems out, that the solution to their problem is to talk to somebody can be undermining or counterintuitive for them.\"\n\nBut it's worth a push. Suicide rates have been rising - there were 6,188 in the UK in 2015, an increase on 2014, and 76 per cent of UK suicides are male - it's now the biggest killer of men under 50. It needn't be. If you're suffering, talk. If you sense someone is suffering, talk.

My sympathies go to those who have suffered because of treatments.\n\nDr Des Spence is correct to raise awareness of issues associated with the level of prescribing of psychoactive drugs such as the \u201cmodern\u201d antidepressants.\n\nAs he points out, GPs, despite working at speed, do need to observe the mantra \u2013 first appointment, diagnose, do not prescribe.\n\nReassessment after a short interval, having provided a listening ear and some information on the condition and non-drug options for treatment, can mean different shared decisions. Patients should expect no less.\n\nProzac (fluoxetine) was the first of the new breed of anti-depressants to be prescribed in quantity after its launch in 1986.\n\nIt remains the most widely used antidepressant in history, prescribed to millions of people worldwide, and many feel they owe their lives to it.\n\nIt is prescribed for depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, panic disorder, eating disorders and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (formerly known as PMT).\n\nThat does not mean that it and other commonly used similar drugs such as citalopram and sertraline do not have side effects nor withdrawal effects; they do.\n\nMany previously used antidepressants were dangerous and often fatal when there was an overdose.\n\nAn opportunity was missed when, in the 1980s and 1990s, such prescriptions cost the NHS \u00a322 per month (in today\u2019s terms, \u00a363).\n\nCognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and similar approaches had by then been more or less established as an effective intervention for mild to moderate depression or anxiety disorders.\n\nIt would have cost a lot less then for a course of such treatment than a six-to-12 month course of the drugs.\n\nBut this was not explored as a cost-effective alternative, this despite the fact that mental health became a Scottish NHS priority alongside cardiovascular disease and cancer.\n\nIn more recent years, health psychologists (honours psychology graduates with a year\u2019s CBT training) began working in NHS clinical psychology departments and deliver such talking therapy courses to individuals.\n\nHealth psychologists cost on average around \u00a323 for an hour\u2019s treatment.\n\nOut of patent since 2001, in contrast, fluoxetine now costs the NHS just under \u00a31 for a month\u2019s prescription at standard dose.\n\nWaiting times for psychology treatment tend still to run to several months with small reductions since targets were introduced.\n\nOnline treatment courses such as Beating the Blues do suit some and can be offered promptly in my own health board area to those who have computers and printers at home.\n\nThe drugs are cheap but other options are not. That said, private CBT is available from around \u00a355 per session which, for many, is an affordable and successful treatment often requiring fewer than 10 sessions.\n\nIt is time for GPs and the NHS to do better.\n\nPhilip Gaskell, GP,\n\nWoodlands Lodge,\n\nBuchanan Castle Estate,\n\nDrymen.", "image": "http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7154462/", "subject": "depression"}, "faaedb8dab41f0a686c0b9dcf9f5f971": {"title": "Weather update: Deep depression in Bay to weaken before landfall", "summary": "The latest deep depression over Central Bay of Bengal has been located to 590 km south-south-east of Gopalpur (Odisha) and 660 km east-southeast of Machilipatnam (Andhra Pradesh) this morning.

One in every 20 individuals will, at some point in their lives, be diagnosed with the illness. According to government estimates, 1 in 5 people are in need of some form of mental health therapy - counselling, psychotherapy or psychiatric treatment. There are many such intimidating statistics, but let's not get into that. The point is that mental illness, and especially depression, is a lot more common than we would like to believe. Yet, there is little we know about it. Chances are, that at some point in your life, somebody you know, or you yourself, will suffer from depression. Because it is invisible, it often goes unrecognised, as a result of which many suffer. This is why everybody needs to know these basic facts about depression.\n\n1. Depression and sadness are different things\n\nWhile sadness is a perfectly healthy response to many life situations, and an emotion that we all feel at some point, depression is an illness that may or may not be a response to a life situation. The biggest difference between sadness and depression is that the latter lasts two weeks or longer, and is not alleviated by feel-good things.\n\n2. Depression is an illness, just like asthma\n\nIt's not a phase. It's not a luxury. It's not a mood. It is a mood disorder. There is a biological component to depression wherein the neurotransmitters that keep our mood balanced go haywire. There are symptoms of the disease, and a proper treatment protocol.\n\n3. Sadness is not the ONLY symptom of depression\n\nWhile sadness may be the most prominent symptom for some people, for others, it might be extreme anger and snappiness. Other symptoms include changes in appetite, sleep patterns, feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, and fatigue.\n\n4. Depression requires treatment\n\nThis can't be emphasised enough. Depression is an illness and, like any other illness, it requires proper treatment by qualified mental health professionals.\n\n5. Treatment for depression involves medication and psychotherapy\n\nIn mild to moderate cases of depression, psychotherapy alone may be helpful. But, in severe cases, a combination of both psychotherapy and medication is ideal.\n\n6. Depression can lead to physical ailments and discomfort\n\nHeadaches, IBS, hypertension, arthritis, and ulcers are some of the diseases that are commonly seen among patients of depression. The body and mind are interconnected, and a mental illness can lead to other health problems.\n\n7. You can't talk someone out of depression\n\nPep talk doesn't work, and no, psychotherapy is not just about talking. You can't talk someone out of depression. You can temporarily make them feel better (if the depression is mild), but the heaviness that is inherent in the disease will come back.\n\n8. If left untreated, depression can lead to suicide\n\nPeople don't just decide one moment to end their lives. They usually do it when they are pushed to a point of no return, after a long internal struggle. That struggle is depression. If left unrecognised and untreated, it can progress to suicidal thoughts and intent.\n\nFor more article by the author on depression, click on the links below:\n\n1. Not Just A Passing Phase!

One in three who had been in hospital more than a month said they had been given less than 48 hours\u2019 notice.\n\nResearch published in 2014 found that during the first three months after discharge, patients were at a \u201cparticularly high\u201d risk of taking their own lives.\n\nDespite this, fewer than half (44%) of the people Mind surveyed said that managing their mental health or self-care had been considered in their plans for leaving hospital.\n\nHalf (51%) said their accommodation needs were considered in any plans, and less than one third (29%) said money and benefits were considered.\n\nPerennial problem\n\nMental health experts contacted by Community Care said without exception that Mind\u2019s findings came as \u201cno surprise\u201d.\n\nAndy Bell, deputy chief executive at the Centre for Mental Health, said the survey results \u201creflect to a large degree perennial problems\u201d in the system.\n\n\u201cYou could probably have seen responses like this at any time in the last 20 years,\u201d Bell said, \u201cand it\u2019s hard without a time series to pick out the precise impact of current [financial and resource] issues in different places, and how much practice is not up to the expected standards.\u201d\n\nBell said that it was essential the commitment to expanding crisis resolution services in the NHS England-commissioned Mental Health Five Year Forward View was implemented properly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s often forgotten that planning for discharge is as much a part of that work as gatekeeping and preventing hospital admission when they can,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to ensure that, as crisis teams go back up to nationwide coverage, they include discharge planning and support as a fundamental part of what they do \u2013 this survey shows it cannot be optional.\u201d\n\nPressure on \u2018leave\u2019 beds\n\nSteve Matthews, who blogs as the Masked AMHP, said that \u2018leave\u2019 beds, which are supposed to be kept open for people making short stays at home, were being filled by others, exacerbating the situation.\n\n\u201cYou have a patient supposedly [staying at home as part of] a planned discharge, and then can\u2019t come back to hospital \u2013 so they are simply discharged before they\u2019re ready,\u201d he said.\n\nMatthews described recent examples of people being discharged and inadequately supported, leading them to relapse and be readmitted to hospital.\n\nHe said shortages of both beds and staff were contributing to a \u201ccomplete disregard\u201d of the Care Programme Approach (CPA), which is meant to provide for a smooth transition between health and social care services for people with mental health needs.\n\nAnother AMHP, \u2018AsifAMHP\u2018, said service cuts and welfare reforms meant that trying to ensure housing and benefits were in place for people who had been in hospital was becoming ever more difficult, even for staff willing and able to put in the effort.\n\n\u201cThe CPA and the old Community Care Act were clear that discharges should be properly planned but in the chaos we are working in, how do you practically do that?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf people have good social networks, [friends and family] will step into the breach but it\u2019s very hard for people who are isolated,\u201d he added. \u201cTen or 15 years ago there were more \u2018other services\u2019 to pick things up.\u201d\n\n\u2018Left to cope alone\u2019\n\nPaul Farmer, Mind\u2019s chief executive, described the picture painted by the survey as \u201cshocking\u201d, adding that it was \u201ca tragedy that so many people, so very recently leaving the care of hospital are being left to cope alone\u201d and at potential risk to their lives.\n\n\u201cWhether you\u2019ve been in hospital for days or months, when you come out you need the right care and support to help you stay well,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cLeaving hospital and coming home can be daunting \u2013 you need to feel prepared and confident you will get the support and services you need to help pick up the pieces and continue getting better,\u201d Farmer added. \u201cProviders must urgently make the improvements needed for everyone in their care.\u201d", "image": "https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/cjp-rbi-comcare/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2016/10/Fotolia_42756054_S.jpg", "subject": "mental health"}, "f6dab4a827c6f397cd15905ba315740c": {"title": "\u201cYou&#39;ve got be strong and honest\u201d: Peace talk mental health and brand new song &#39;From Under ...", "summary": "A good thing: the charity MQ, which takes a research-led approach to treating mental health issues.

Harry told NME why it\u2019s high-time to talk about mental health.\n\nFrom Under Liquid Glass From Under Liquid Glass, a song by Peace on Spotify\n\nHow did MQ become involved with \u2018From Under Liquid Glass\u2019?\n\n\u201cI was a bit shy about [the song] \u2018cause it was a very personal account of what was going on at the time. But I was encouraged to put belief in the song and then it was put forward for this partnership with MQ. There was a statistic that took me back a bit: 75% of mental illnesses start before the age of 24. And less than 30% of the research spending goes on understanding mental illness in children. I was really grabbed by that \u2013 it just opened my eyes that our society is built wrong around mental illness. It\u2019s wrong and there needs to be change.\u201d\n\nHow does this issue resonate with you personally?\n\n\u201cIn the last year or so I found that I was really struggling, being visited by demons that I hadn\u2019t been visited by for a long time. The six months running up to the writing of this song were really hard, so I wrote it as a personal account. When I saw this campaign, it really took me. As a songwriter, I\u2019m really blessed that I can write songs about the way I feel and put things out to the universe \u2013 even if no one hears them. It was the first time that I\u2019d written a song really that really scared me.\u201d\n\nMen often find it hard to open up about mental health. Did you find it embarrassing to reveal the track to the rest of the band?\n\n\u201cYeah, definitely. Peace has always been a big eruption of positivity \u2013 our thing has always been to push positivity. Peace has always been about love and these explosions of happiness. Then writing a song that didn\u2019t fit with that was really strange, even though it was really honest for me. I didn\u2019t want people to be disappointed. It\u2019s really hard \u2013 especially for men, because there\u2019s an expectation to be strong. Even for me, a publicly known weakling.\u201d\n\nWhat was the reaction from the rest of the band?\n\n\u201cI think everyone just loved the song and felt the honesty of it, you know? I felt that they understood. Everyone, at some point in their lives, will come into contact with mental health issues, whether it be yourself or someone you know. I was really surprised; I kind of thought everyone would just be like, \u2018Woah what\u2019s going on?\u2019 But they got it immediately and thought it was really honest.\u201d\n\nNME Newsletter Sign up for the newsletter Your email address: Sign Up\n\nThere\u2019s an amazing lyric in the chorus: \u201cI\u2019m left alone with my big fucking mental head\u201d. Was that plain-speaking language an conscious attempt to demystify issues around depression and mental health?\n\n\u201cYeah, definitely, I wanted it to be as straightforward as possible. It actually felt really good saying it. I wrote down how I felt: \u201cI\u2019m left alone in my big fucking mental head.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to change it at all. It felt like that\u2019s exactly what it needed to say, but also that\u2019s the biggest fear \u2013 people knowing. But I thought: \u2018You\u2019ve got to be strong about these things, and honest.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt feels like people have been more open about mental health in recent years. Is that a cause for optimism?\n\n\u201cI think so, yeah. Being able to talk about it \u2013 being able to say to your best mate that your mental health isn\u2019t all right \u2013 is something that, say, five years ago you\u2019d never have been able to do. It definitely feels like that\u2019s on the change, but also mental health issues in young people haven rapidly rising over the last five or 10 years. So it\u2019s even more important that it becomes completely OK to talk openly about it.\u201d\n\nMore: \u2018Am I depressed?\u2019 \u2013 help and advice on mental health and what to do next\n\nFor help and advice on mental health issues, check out the below organisations:", "image": "http://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/55/2017/12/PEACE-resized.jpg", "subject": "mental health"}, "7d7769f7aa4cd64beab6fe2fbe8b4e5c": {"title": "How to keep mental health front of mind", "summary": "In January 2017, the prime minister commissioned Lord Dennis Stevenson, former HBOS chair, and chief executive of mental health charity Mind, Paul Farmer, to conduct a review into how employers can help all employees, including those with mental health problems, to succeed in the workplace.", "url": "https://www.ttgmedia.com/news/features/how-to-keep-mental-health-front-of-mind-12579", "date": "2017-12-08T10:18:45Z", "text": "What you need to know about recent guidance on improving mental health in the workplace\n\nIn January 2017, the prime minister commissioned Lord Dennis Stevenson, former HBOS chair, and chief executive of mental health charity Mind, Paul Farmer, to conduct a review into how employers can help all employees, including those with mental health problems, to succeed in the workplace. On October 26, 2017, the Stevenson and Farmer review published its findings about mental health in the workplace, which found that the challenges were much bigger than originally thought.\n\nThe review found that:\n\n300,000 people with long-term mental health problems lose their jobs each year. This is approximately double the rate of those without a mental health condition and a much higher rate than those with physical health conditions.\n\nApproximately 15% of people in work have symptoms of an existing mental health condition.\n\nPoor mental health costs employers up to \u00a342 billion annually because of problems such as poor productivity, sickness absence cover and replacing employees who leave.\n\nKey recommendations\n\nThe review recommends that all employers implement a framework of actions to help employees to thrive in the workplace. The authors believe this should be achievable with little or no cost to the employer. It includes:\n\nCreating and implementing a mental health at work plan;\n\nDeveloping mental health awareness among employees and encouraging open conversations about mental health;\n\nProviding good working conditions and a healthy work-life balance;\n\nTraining line managers to effectively support employees;\n\nMonitoring employee mental health and wellbeing.\n\nThe review suggests larger employers (those with 500 or more staff) and the public sector should go further and improve accountability, transparency, disclosure and access to clinical support.\n\nThere is a call for the government to align occupational health and the practical support available from the NHS to create an integrated in-work support service to assist employees. This will be welcomed by employers, who are often unaware of the scope of external support available to individuals as part of the wider management of employees with mental health issues.\n\nChanges to existing discrimination legislation have also been proposed to enhance the protections for employees with mental health conditions and to clarify the role of employers in providing reasonable adjustments. This will no doubt be a concern for employers, who have been working with the Equality Act and associated tribunal guidance for a number of years and may be resistant to further legislation in this area.\n\nThe review suggests that statutory sick pay (SSP) should be more flexible to better allow for individuals to return to work on a phased basis. The thinking behind this recommendation is that SSP could \u201ctop up\u201d pro rata wages during a phased return to work. While an interesting idea, the low rates of SSP are likely to be of limited assistance to many employees.\n\nWhat now?\n\nEmployers will be aware that the Equality Act 2010 covers both mental and physical conditions for the purpose of establishing whether a condition could amount to a disability. Employers should always consider the extent to which any mental health issue may amount to a disability as, if so, such individuals would be entitled to enhanced protections such as the duty to make reasonable adjustments.\n\nWhether or not an employee\u2019s poor mental health amounts to a disability, poor productivity, increased absence rates and a failure to fulfil potential is costly to a business.

Suddenly I went from being a good girl to being disruptive. But I continued to get good grades, so I was again left to cope.\n\nLong before going into care I believed I should be able to cope entirely by myself.

Depending on who you ask, he is either refreshingly frank or shockingly unpresidential.

His critics now include mental health professionals after several news stories, as well as the president\u2019s own tweets, revealed Trump continues to believe in several thoroughly debunked conspiracy theories.\n\nAt no other time in U.S. history has a group of mental health professionals been so collectively concerned about a sitting president. This is not because he is an unusual person \u2014 his presentation is almost typical for a forensic psychiatrist like myself whose patients are mostly violence offenders \u2014 but it is highly unusual to find such a person in the office of presidency. For the U.S., it may be unprecedented; for many parts of the world where this has happened before, the outcome has been uniformly devastating.\n\nA group of us put our concerns into a book, \"The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: 27 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Assess a President.\" That book became an instant New York Times bestseller.

Much of this has to do with his effects on our own mental health.\n\nFor one, Americans are exhausted. The 24/7 news cycle may be part of the reason why, but there\u2019s potentially another explanation. Pathology is confusing to the healthy. There is a reason why staying in close quarters with a person suffering from mental illness usually induces what is called a \u201cshared psychosis.\u201d Vulnerable or weakened individuals are more likely to succumb, and when their own mental health is compromised, they may develop an irresistible attraction to pathology, destruction, and even death (of self or others). The resulting harm is how we tell illness from health.\n\nPolitics has nothing to do with medicine, which is why a liberal health professional would not ignore a kidney stone in a patient just because he is Republican. Similarly, health professionals would not call liver cancer something else because it is afflicting the president. When signs of illness become apparent, it is natural for the physician to recommend an exam. But when the ailment goes so far as to affect an individuals ability to perform his duty, and in some cases risks harm to the public as a result, then the health professional has a duty to sound the alarm.\n\nHuman beings are an enviably adaptable species. However, when mechanisms go awry and reach a state of disorder, the capacity for variety and diversity diminishes and behavior becomes very predictable. This diminishing of flexibility is as consistent in the failing heart as it is in the cancer cell or the disordered human mind.", "image": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_49/1867681/170117-donald-trump-elevator-929a_2da838180129329e635377b42894621b.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "subject": "mental health"}, "864d46326fb8b683ac3d9b70c6336ead": {"title": "Sleepless Nights because of Ethical Dilemmas in Mental Health Care for Asylum Seekers", "summary": "Abstract.

This article compares the social, political and cultural factors in mental health professionals\u2019 ethical dilemmas and reflections in both periods. The data consists of papers from an expert meeting in 1995 on Medical Ethical Standards in Mental Health Care for Refugees, and interviews and focus groups with health professionals on ethical dilemmas in mental health care for asylum seekers in 2015. Using a discursive approach to analyse the data, we found that, in 1995, as well as in 2015, the deliberations of mental health professionals reveal medical, social, cultural and judicial paradigms. In 2015, political factors tend to weigh more heavily than in 1995. We conclude that, in both periods, mental health professionals experience conflicts of values but the context of care for asylum seekers changed.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAs a result of global turmoil, especially the conflict in Syria in 2015, there has been a substantial increase in the number of asylum seekers entering Europe. Citizens and politicians in various European countries are debating the \u2018refugee crisis\u2019. This debate highlights feelings that asylum seekers pose an imminent threat to society as well as feelings of embarrassment triggered by the lack of sympathy shown to asylum seekers. This is not the first instance in the recent history of Europe when an increased number of asylum seekers sparked such debates. Similar discussions were prominent during the Balkan crisis: especially in the period 1992\u201395, when the number of asylum requests in Europe were higher than normal.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the number of asylum requests in 1994 (53,000) was comparable to 2015 (58,000). In the intermittent years in the period 1994\u20132015, the number of requests remained relatively small. There are, however, some signs that, between 1994 and 2015, the debate on the \u2018refugee crisis\u2019 has changed. Both the Netherlands Institute for Human Rights and the Advisory Committee on Migration Affairs in the Netherlands state that more restrictive immigration policies were implemented that jeopardize human rights. These organizations are concerned about the detention of asylum seekers, the restrictive policies concerning family reunification and the criminalization of individuals without legal documentation (Advisory Committee on Migration Affairs 2013).\n\nMany asylum seekers suffer from psychological symptoms (Gerritsen et al. 2006). When they receive mental health care, they convey to professionals issues of social injustice, inhumane treatment and the aftermath of conflicts in their lives. As in 1995, mental health professionals in 2015 question the appropriateness of their methods for treatment. Has anything changed in these two decades? Are mental health professionals confronted with the same dilemmas now as then? This article focuses on professional ethical dilemmas and will compare the impact of social and political factors on their moral reflections 20 years ago to those in the present situation.\n\nThe results of this study will help to improve the understanding of contextual, societal and socio-historical background of the current debates about asylum seekers. Furthermore, it recognizes ethical dilemmas of mental health care professionals. This is important because these professionals are taking responsibility for the lives of those living in the margins of Western societies and may themselves experience feelings of futility (Brodwin 2013). The ethics of mental health care for asylum seekers seem to be a neglected topic in psychiatry (Bloch and Green 1981/2009). The establishment of guidelines could assist professionals in determining what is at stake when treating asylum seekers in terms of an individual\u2019s right to health care services, the goal and methodology of treatment, judicial consequences and societal integration.\n\nHuman Rights and Ethical Dilemmas\n\nAsylum seekers have always been a unique group of patients for professionals in mental health care. As a result of their legal status, they live under more extreme and harsher conditions in comparison to other migrants or the indigenous population of a country. These conditions include human rights violations in their country of origin, the hardships of flight and the asylum request investigation, frequent relocations, denial of resident status, detention and unemployment. A relatively high percentage of asylum seekers contend with an array of mental health problems such as anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress symptoms (Laban and Gernaat 2005; Procter 2005; Gerritsen et al. 2006; Toar et al. 2009; Coffey et al. 2010; Cleveland and Rousseau 2013; Assiri 2014; Goosen et al. 2014; Heeren et al. 2014; Hocking et al. 2015). In comparison to the indigenous Dutch population, there is a higher incidence of suicide and suicidal tendencies amongst asylum seekers (Goosen et al. 2011).\n\nMental health professionals deliberate the nature of their patients\u2019 problems and how symptoms should be interpreted and treated. These deliberations are inherent to mental health care in general. With regard to asylum seekers, however, there is limited evidence for most interventions (Adams et al. 2004; Slobodin and De Jong 2015). Moreover, social and political developments in asylum seekers\u2019 host countries can lead to professional and ethical dilemmas. Whereas a professional dilemma is, for example, the provision of a differential diagnosis or the choice between two equally effective treatments, an ethical dilemma involves a conflict of values.\n\nAn example of an ethical dilemma is when professionals negatively impact their patients\u2019 asylum process by the inadvertent submission of medical information requested for the judicial process (Fran\u00e7ois et al. 2008; Pitman 2010; Gower 2011). Additionally, this information could be used in bringing perpetrators to justice or for the rehabilitation of victims or for developing systems for signalling abuse (British Medical Association 2002: 52). This breaches the issue of trust, as it may prove challenging for asylum seekers to trust medical doctors and psychologists if they have had negative experiences with medical doctors and psychologists in the countries from which they fled. This may have a general effect on the perceptions of asylum seekers towards their mental health professionals (Crosby 2013).\n\nAnother ethical dilemma may arise when mental health care professionals are asked by the immigration authorities to provide clinical evaluations or information about treatment of the asylum seeker (Richman 1995). A positive evaluation of the mental health of a patient can be interpreted as an indication that mental health care is no longer needed.\n\nA third example is informed consent. This is achieved by assuring that the patient understands the method and aim of treatment, a promise for the discretionary handling of sensitive medical information and the collection and documentation of data as evidence of abuse or violence. Mental health professionals are accountable for this discussion with their patients, though cultural assumptions on hierarchy in the doctor\u2013patient relationship can lead to different perceptions of this discussion. At least two related values are at stake: trust in the doctor\u2013patient relationship and transparency about the aims, methods and possible side-effects of treatments.\n\nThere are several approaches within which we may understand these ethical dilemmas. Ethical codes of conduct were established to assist health care professionals in making \u2018good\u2019 decisions (British Medical Association 2002). Professional associations in each discipline develop guidelines that include ethical considerations that address professional values such as responsibility, respect, expertise, reliability, justice, safety and collaboration. Another one that is well known is the principle approach, presented by Beauchamp and Childress (1977/2009). This approach consists of four fundamental principles: beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (doing no harm), respect for autonomy and justice. Several ethicists criticized the universal assumptions of the principle approach, especially the concept of autonomy, arguing that ethics are, as such, contextual (Richters 2002; Malkki 2007), which requires an approach that acknowledges this. More specifically, the ethical dilemmas in mental health care for asylum seekers indicate that we need an approach that acknowledges the socio-political and judicious backgrounds of Western societies.\n\nAn approach that acknowledges these backgrounds is a human rights approach. A human rights approach encompasses moral, judicial and political considerations. Its central claim is that individuals should be respected as agents (Forst 2011). Having experienced human rights violations, the vulnerable position of asylum seekers in a new society makes the human rights issue appropriate for analysing their problems (Williams 2005). Such an approach has in common with the ethics of care a focus on vulnerability from a political\u2013ethical point of view (Tronto 1993/2009). A human rights approach implies that the right to the highest attainable standard of health is directly related to other human rights (WHO 2002), suggesting that health care services should be accessible, available, acceptable and of good quality (International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Article 12, 1966, in WHO 2002). For example, Williams (2005) contended that the right to live free of discrimination, torture and violence, with freedom of speech and equal entitlement to health care services, is of paramount importance. This direct relationship becomes visible in the neglect or violation of human rights as well, since it can lead to serious health complications. Diminishing the risk of poor health, on the other hand, may be accomplished through respect for, protection of and the fulfilment of human rights. Furthermore, a human rights approach can be indicative of how health care policies can support, strengthen or jeopardize human rights. From the perspective of professional codes, it is worth mentioning that the British Medical Association (2002) added nine values to the four principles (Beauchamp and Childress 1977/2009), namely commitment, caring, compassion, integrity, competence, spirit of enquiry, confidentiality, responsibility and advocacy.\n\nIn summary, our theoretical framework is a human rights framework because it does justice to the moral dimensions of societal, political and judicial domains.\n\nMethodology\n\nMethodologically, we take a critical theory perspective to analyse two different data sets. There are two arguments in using a critical theory perspective. First, unequal positions based on power misbalance lead researchers to a critical approach (Duberley et al. 2012). Asylum seekers do not have comparable rights and entitlement to mental health care in comparison to other citizens. In the Netherlands, asylum seekers are entitled to a full range of mental health services; however, due to lack of information or communication problems, they might not utilize these services to the full extent. Researchers using a critical theory perspective are aware of these structural inequalities and have taken them into consideration in developing their methods (Duberley et al. 2012).\n\nThe second argument to use a critical theory perspective is that it sees the aim of research as empowering the people involved, particularly those in less privileged positions. In both studies, publication of the results were used to assist mental health professionals to find satisfying solutions for professional and ethical dilemmas in the care for asylum seekers.\n\nThe critical theory perspective has consequences for the selection of cases, respondents and the methods to analyse the data. The first case is a research project to develop ethical guidelines in mental health care for asylum seekers (Kramer et al. 2015). For this project, six mental health professionals were interviewed and five focus groups were formed around different dilemmas. All interviews were recorded and transcribed. The focus groups were documented and minutes were taken of the meeting. A total of 44 mental health professionals were involved in the project (Kramer et al. 2015). Respondents were selected on their diverse positions, disciplines and locations. Selecting a variety of respondents, increases the possibility of gathering information that shows controversial and sensitive issues.\n\nThe second case is a publication: Medical Ethical Standards in Mental Health Care for Victims of Organized Violence, Refugees and Displaced Persons (van Willigen 1998). This publication was the result of a consultation organized by the advisory group on the health situation of refugees and victims of violence of the World Health Organization. The consultation took place October 1995 in Utrecht, the Netherlands. The publication about this consultation includes an extensive introduction, literature study (van Willigen 1998) and contributions of its participants. This is an excellent source for analysis, as the publication is the result of discussions amongst scientists and mental health professionals.\n\nThe cases are different in how data is collected. However, we think that a comparison of data in these projects is possible because they had the same kind of origin and the same kind of objective. In both cases, non-governmental organizations, one for supporting mental health professionals and one for advocating a human rights approach for asylum seekers and refugees, took the initiative to the consultation and to develop guidelines. The data from the 2015 project consists of interviews and focus groups, which makes it possible to use direct quotations of the respondents. The data from the 1995 meeting was published afterwards but includes the original presentations. In both cases, we can refer to individual respondents, who express their opinions about ethical dilemmas in mental health care for asylum seekers, which makes this comparison unique.\n\nThe critical theory perspective also had consequences for the method of analysis. To analyse the data, we used discourse analysis (Foucault, in Bryman 2015), which focuses on specific interpretations, controversial meanings and an (over)emphasis on certain elements of asylum seekers\u2019 situations. We looked for mention of the social and political context of asylum seekers and refugees and how these references were part of the arguments for ethical decisions made by mental health professionals.\n\nThis discourse analysis led to the themes presented in the \u2018Results\u2019 section in which we first describe the themes in the data of 1995, then those in the data of 2015. In the discussion, we focus on differences and similarities between the two cases.\n\nResults\n\nSocial and Political Aspects of Ethical Dilemmas in 1995\n\nFour themes arise from the analysis of the 1995 data. Scientists and mental health professionals express concerns about the system of mental health care in general. We interpreted them as concerns about medicalization and a lack of critique of cultures. In their individual relationships with patients with different cultural backgrounds, respondents are concerned about informed consent and autonomy.\n\nConcerns about the Medicalization of Asylum Seekers\n\nSeveral participants in the European Consultation on Medical Ethical Standards in Mental Health Care for Refugees and Displaced Persons in 1995 were reluctant in identifying the psychological problems of asylum seekers as medical or mental health issues. The interpretation of psychological problems can lead to conflicts between medical, social and political models (Bracken et al. 1995; Summerfield 1999). In a medical paradigm, symptoms of asylum seekers are easily understood and classified as, for example, part of a post-traumatic stress disorder. A more critical approach acknowledges that the social and political contexts of the psychological problems are then often ignored. Survivors of human rights violations who testify and press charges against their perpetrators can be \u2018converted\u2019 to patients in need of therapy as a means of (re)processing their traumatic memories. Bracken, Giller and Summerfield argue that the medical profession has influenced the discussion of moral issues in society:\n\nToday, medicine is the site where science impacts on the lives of ordinary people most directly. As science has replaced religion as the chief source of explanation about life and birth, illness and death, the social position of medical professionals has become more prominent; they are now centrally involved in many ethical debates (Bracken et al., in van Willigen 1998: 87).\n\nThe increased credence attached to the explanatory models of science, and medicine in particular, are examples of what has been called cultural modernism (Bracken et al., in van Willigen 1998). Modernity involves a valorization of reason and science and a disregard of tradition, religion and disorder, which affects society as a whole. Eventually and relevant for this analysis, the modernistic agenda resulted, for example, in the development of special treatment units for refugees. Bracken and his co-authors criticize this development:\n\nIn other words, it is possible to interpret the emergence of therapeutic centres for refugees and victims of torture as one product of the modernist project, aimed at controlling the disorder provoked by suffering and loss by instituting programmes of analysis and therapy. In our experience this is the intellectual context in which most workers in this area operate today. Within such a framework the issue of ethics is about the development of codes of practice: principle of access and intervention which will allow refugees to benefit from progress in the area of psychiatry and psychotherapy (Bracken et al., in van Willigen 1998: 89).\n\nBracken, Giller and Summerfield were very critical about interpreting problems of refugees as mental health problems. They think the development of special programmes for the psychological treatment of asylum seekers has unanticipated effects. Their major concern is that asylum seekers begin to organize and present their situation in a \u2018modern\u2019 way, in accordance with Western psychological ideas and categories, as a means of having their suffering recognized (Bracken et al., in van Willigen 1998). The incorporation of a new paradigm in relation to one\u2019s suffering can have serious negative consequences, like a cultural disconnection or a limited and biased focus on responsibility and (in)competence in dealing with traumatic experiences:\n\nIt inherently involves a loosening of one\u2019s ties with the home culture, the very culture whose myths or religious idiom may be important sustaining factors (for their health and well-being). \u2026 By adopting this framework, refugees can begin to regard themselves as particular cases, in which current suffering is understood to be the product of their own individual trauma and failure to cope (Bracken et al., in van Willigen 1998: 93).\n\nBy adhering to this position, refugees may begin to undervalue their own capacity for survival and endurance. The authors take the discussion about ethical dilemmas in mental health care for asylum seekers to a general level by contending that not all asylum seekers, as a group, require mental health care services or referrals to the various institutions established for this group.\n\nThey challenge the health care workers to question the assumptions from which their practice springs (Bracken et al., in van Willigen 1998).\n\nConcerns about a lack of critique of cultures: Richters stresses the importance of medical anthropologists in the development of ethics in (mental) health care and highlights the relativity of ethical principles:\n\nWestern health care workers and patients from different cultural traditions call for a special kind of listening. Listening to the patient is rightly perceived as one of the key medical ethical principles. But culturally pluralistic health care settings require extra qualities to allow the kind of listening, interpretation and explanation necessary to ensure valid patient consent. Anthropology can help by translating \u2018listening to the patient\u2019 into \u2018understanding the patient\u2019 (Richters, in van Willigen 1998: 72).\n\nHealth practices in different cultures have developed in many ways. Opinions about appropriate (mental) health care show much variety. Richters states that scientists and medical professions from Western countries should refrain from judging other cultural systems or practices because their professional position may be influenced by colonialism and \u2018Western privilege\u2019:\n\nIf one reminds oneself of the often gruesome colonial and imperial past of Western nations, and of the present state of the art of these nations, one may wonder whether we Westerners are the chosen people for such moral evangelization (Richters, in van Willigen 1998: 75).\n\nOn the other hand, she argues that critique of cultural (health) practices remains important:\n\nCultural anthropologists often take a culturally relativistic stance. That is, they describe things that are different in different cultures, how they are different and why they are different. They describe the cultural framework of presuppositions, values and norms, they show how moral problems are perceived and handled by those whom they affect. But to avoid any ethnocentrism they do not judge the views and practices they describe as good or bad. Though we may praise this considerateness, it blocks any cultural critique (Richters, in van Willigen 1998: 73).\n\nRichters is concerned with Western imperialism in health care and more specifically medical ethics. Her concern is that social systems of refugees who could possibly benefit from Western mental health services could create a disconnect with their \u2018cultural background\u2019. Bracken, Giller and Summerfield fear this would have an adverse effect on survivors of organized violence. Richters viewed this from another position: some practices are oppressive and the use of these should perhaps be reassessed despite their long-standing acceptance. Questioning and reflecting upon the inherent injustices in one\u2019s own cultural heritage may assist in replacing a horrible past with a future of equality and optimism. Victims of organized violence might want to reconsider cultural practices of suffering and health behaviour in their country of origin:\n\nAs we have seen, questioning the values, norms and customs of other cultures is not by definition a matter of ethnocentrism. Questioning someone\u2019s mental make-up is not by definition a matter of trespassing at the border of neutrality that the health care professions are supposed to honour. Questioning neutrality is not by definition trespassing at the border of ethics. On the contrary it could be, and often is, an act in the name of mankind and civilization. Let us admit that refusing neutrality is often heart-breaking, but is the lesser of competing evils (Richters, in van Willigen 1998: 77).\n\nThe ethical dimensions Bracken, Giller and Summerfield and Richters discussed are social, cultural and political. The survivor-to-patient transformation is potentially harmful for asylum seekers who engage in Western health care systems, as was described above. On the other hand, too much respect for cultural systems can leave oppressive and unjust practices uncovered.\n\nConcerns about informed consent: A very important ethical rule for health care practitioners is that of informed consent, which obliges doctors, psychiatrists and psychologist to explain the nature of the proposed treatment including its anticipated risks to patients. This is officially regulated by national laws and international codes of ethics in science as well as in health care. In the Netherlands, the Medical Therapy Agreement Bill (Wet Geneeskundige Behandelingsovereenkomst) was passed in April 1995.\n\nVan Leeuwen assumes that informed consent is the result of a social development that takes moral and social values in Western societies into consideration. He defines this as rationalizing behaviour by setting rules. With an agreement of treatment as a prerequisite, a respectful discussion about any kind of treatment is possible between patients and doctors:\n\nThe formal nature of these rules expresses the underlying thought that although individuals may differ in many aspects they are nonetheless socially equal and equally capable of acting as reasonable persons (van Leeuwen, in van Willigen 1998: 53).\n\nSubsequently to the Enlightenment, education, law, trade and traffic are regulated with the premise that people act with reason and can be held accountable for their actions. Medicine and medical morality are among the last domains in which the concept of rationality has been introduced (van Leeuwen, in van Willigen 1998: 56). Medical decisions concerning euthanasia, treatment of psychosis or coma has long been considered the primary responsibility of doctors. The present situation dictates that the health care professional as well as the patient are involved in making rational decisions:\n\nAt the heart of these problems lies the entanglement of morality and the concept of the reasonable person. This concept grants every member of society freedom in the sense of non-interference by others as long as the person does no harm to others (van Leeuwen, in van Willigen 1998: 56).\n\nVan Leeuwen thinks that, for patients not born and raised in the West, the concept of informed consent may prove difficult to grasp. They may not experience their physician to be an equal discussion partner or there may be little to no opportunity within the health care system to discuss or consider alternative methods of treatment. Van Leeuwen assumes refugees do not know that personal participation in the treatment process is an option and are perhaps less familiar with the rationalization of behaviour. In addition to \u2018missing that development\u2019, they may also have had experiences in which they felt the doctor\u2019s procedures were not in their best interest:\n\nRefugees do not automatically share Western rationalized values with respect to getting information or negotiating as reasonable persons. Some of them may even recognize in their doctor a representative of the same system they have to fight to get a residence permit; others may expect doctors to act according to the cultural value system they are used to (van Leeuwen, in van Willigen 1998: 58).\n\nApplying the rule of informed consent to refugees requiring mental health services can prove to be a daunting task. Perhaps the doctor/patient equation is unbalanced due to a lack of trust: \u2018Alienation and the experience of medical assaults and torture can block the establishment of a trusting relationship\u2019 (van Leeuwen, in van Willigen 1998: 59).\n\nAccording to van Leeuwen, cultural values and professional codes of conduct should serve as a catalyst in the decisions physicians make in considering methods of treatment, even if refugees have not been subjected to medical mishaps. Conveying and discussing the concepts of informed consent and autonomy with asylum seekers may prove challenging.\n\nConcerns about autonomy: Autonomy can be described as a personal rule of the self that is free from both controlling interferences by others and from personal limitations that prevent meaningful choices, such as inadequate understanding (Beauchamp and Childress 1977/2009). It relates to the informed consent procedure in which health care professionals, in order to respect patient autonomy, have to inform their patients properly. From a psychological perspective, we could say that an increase in autonomy during adolescence occurs in most societies; however, cultural differences in the family dynamic do occur (Hauff, in van Willigen 1998). Increased autonomy, in relationship to both internal conflict and environment, is often considered a fundamental aim of psychotherapy. Autonomy can be perceived as the direct advancement of one\u2019s intentions in interaction with others in situations where one\u2019s own interests are at risk (Gullestad 1990, in Hauff, in van Willigen 1998).\n\nHauff, a psychiatrist, cites a case study with a 19-year-old female patient undergoing psychotherapeutic treatment. The patient recognized, understood and accepted the concept of autonomy. Her parents, who fled Vietnam, are at odds with their daughter\u2019s attitude. Hauff\u2019s case study indicates the positive effects psychotherapy has on his patient despite her parents not concurring with either his or their daughter\u2019s opinions. He concludes: \u2018The autonomy of a patient is not a static phenomenon, but an ongoing process involving the person and his relationship with others within a changing sociocultural context\u2019 (Hauff, in van Willigen 1998: 68).\n\nIn the case of mental health care for refugees, it may prove essential to discuss issues of autonomy explicitly in an attempt to increase the patient\u2019s competence and awareness of the psychotherapeutic process (Hauff, in van Willigen 1998: 68):\n\nMigrants frequently come from societies in the \u2018South\u2019 or \u2018East\u2019, which may have had strong and stable cultural traditions but are now undergoing both a rapid social change and a sociocultural disintegration. They come to societies which they frequently view as culturally \u2018distant\u2019 (Hauff, in van Willigen 1998: 63).\n\nVan Leeuwen and Hauff both address ethical dilemmas in therapeutic relationships with regard to informed consent and autonomy. All agree that involvement in (mental) health care may have serious repercussions in the social relationships of asylum seekers.\n\nIn summary, the discursive reasoning of mental health professionals about ethical dilemmas in 1995, as far as is reported in the studied document, shows that asylum seekers are seen as being culturally different and unfamiliar with the Western health care system. This led health care professionals to question how appropriate their framework is in light of treatment of asylum seekers. They also assume that asylum seekers have an undeveloped sense of the concepts of informed consent, doctor/patient relationships and autonomy. In all, mental health professionals feared that the loss of cultural values of their patients may be at jeopardy. Additionally, political factors were only perceived as pertaining to the countries of origin and the connection asylum seekers still had there. The social political framework to analyse the problems of asylum seekers led to a preference for a psycho-social, multidisciplinary approach (van Willigen 1998: 108) in which judicial aspects of the asylum process were not explicitly mentioned.\n\nSocial and Political Aspects of Ethical Dilemmas in 2015\n\nA discursive analysis focusing on social and political aspects of the ethical dilemmas of mental health professionals in 2015 can be broken down into three themes. First, the conditions under which asylum seekers live are in themselves a burden that can result in (additional) stress and other psychological symptoms. Second, mental health has become part of the institutional system in which asylum seekers are dealing with different paradigms: medical and legal. A major concern for mental health professionals is how to respond to questions posed by medical advisers from immigration authorities within a legal paradigm. Third, some mental health professionals question if they should assume a more advocative position.\n\nConcerns about social conditions of asylum seekers: While awaiting the processing of their asylum request, asylum seekers are housed in reception centres with the barest of amenities. They are provided a small living space usually without private sleeping arrangements. They share kitchen and sanitary facilities. They must adhere to the rules and regulations of the facility\u2019s security personnel. The noise levels are at best challenging and not conducive for recovering from the flight experience or for coping with the stress subsequent to the experiences which initiated their exodus. Asylum seekers have hardly any rights or opportunities for gainful employment.\n\nMost health care professionals are aware of the conditions under which their clients subsist and express their concerns accordingly. They have doubts about what these conditions mean for the diagnostic process and the choice of a treatment intervention and its effect:\n\nAs long as the asylum seeker is involved in the asylum procedure, there is no stability, social support or respite. Because he lives in a reception centre, with very little privacy, he has nothing to do. Because of this, he is under continuous stress. Sometimes I give the asylum seeker this example: Suppose you\u2019re a soccer player. Someone kicks your ankle resulting in an injury. You go to a physiotherapist and he says rest your ankle, do these exercises, maybe get some medication and in a few months your ankle will be fine. But your coach says, no, you have to play and you must. Your injury doesn\u2019t get the time required to heal. The therapist can treat you but not your ankle. I seldom see patients recovering from psychological symptoms or disorder during the asylum procedure (R1).\n\nThis is especially true when the period of residence in a reception centre is lengthy (sometimes years), when asylum seekers are frequently moved from place to place or when health care is not readily available. Immigration authorities can transfer asylum seekers from a reception centre to a detention centre. In such instances, health care professionals must contact the immigration authorities as to the current location and situation of their patient. According to some mental health practitioners, the social and living conditions of asylum seekers and practices of the Dutch immigration authorities exemplify a lack of compassion and empathy. There appears to be no interest in providing a safe and stable situation, which is a condition for mental health treatment in general and the treatment of trauma in particular:\n\nI call that social injustice; especially vulnerable people who come to us because they are mentally unstable and require medical attention. They have psychological and sometimes physical problems and lack the basic necessities of life. We take safety and housing for granted. They are moved from place to place. They might even end up in a detention centre or face deportation. This has consequences for our treatment. I often experience that treatment is effective but the patient is forced to discontinue against his will, of course (R5).\n\nAsylum seekers are officially entitled to health and mental health care services, but other factors may influence their actual access to these services. For example, they did not receive information about the availability of these services, or they may not be able to obtain the required referral. In addition, they may feel shame or guilt in asking for help with mental health issues, which hinders accessibility of necessary health care:\n\nThe question is whether a person in need gets the care he deserves, assuming the care is available. In every society there are groups that have little to no right to health care services with the perception that they, as a group, are not entitled (R4).\n\nTreating asylum seekers can have an unexpected effect on the emotions of therapists. Their concerns about the situation of their patients, including their patients\u2019 social conditions, may cause health care professionals to feel inclined to rescue their patients. However, in their attempts, they inadvertently become personally involved and attached to the degree that they create psychologically stressful situations for themselves. This brings along specific dilemmas:\n\nThe helplessness, the despair and their call for help makes us want to try and find a solution to stop the pain. This can affect me as a therapist as well. Your reaction is to save them and help these people out of their misery but you can\u2019t achieve that. So for me, as a therapist, it is important to accept that this is a helpless situation and patients lack the power to change it and that I, as a result, will start feeling helpless in any attempts to do so (R6).\n\nAs the result of an indeterminate stay in the reception centres, it is difficult for health care professionals to gauge when, or even whether, psychotherapy or any other trauma reprocessing therapies for their clients can or should be initiated. Moreover, it becomes nearly impossible to set realistic goals for treatment:\n\nAs a professional I experienced that I started something that I couldn\u2019t complete. Old emotions surfaced but there was no time to heal. That made me reluctant to start psychotherapeutic sessions even though I realised this person might benefit from them. I focus on the present situation and how to cope with that. That\u2019s also effective but the effect is short lived. So you have to learn how to be realistic about the possibilities in this situation. They are in a bad situation and psychotherapy can\u2019t produce miracles. Keep your aim low, that\u2019s also better for the patient. It\u2019s tempting to motivate your patient to achieve much and give him hope, tell him that everything will be all right, but you and your patient may get disappointed (R4).\n\nSummarizing these results, we conclude that the concerns about the social conditions of asylum seekers not only affect the diagnostic and treatment processes of these patients, but also affects mental health care professionals in significant ways.\n\nConcerns about sharing information with third parties: To understand the inherent ethical dilemmas, additional information about the asylum procedure is required. Approximately 50 per cent of all asylum applications in the Netherlands are honoured. From these, half are honoured after one or more subsequent appeals (Immigration and Naturalisation Office 2012). Upon denial of an appeal, the asylum seeker is required to leave the country within four weeks. If the asylum seeker suffers from serious medical problems, it is possible to appeal the decision under Article 64 of the Immigration Law. This request postpones repatriation in light of extenuating medical circumstances. In this instance, the Immigration and Naturalization Office requests their own medical advisers to initiate an inquiry based on information received by the doctor or psychologist/psychiatrist responsible for treatment of the asylum seeker. The medical adviser is responsible for determining the probability of a medical emergency and whether treatment is available in the country of repatriation. The medical adviser then forwards the findings to the Immigration and Naturalization Office who, in turn, makes a decision based on Article 64.\n\nAs a result of this procedure, mental health professionals are requested to provide medical information about a specific patient. What and how to report this information to medical advisers from the Immigration and Naturalization Office is a major concern to all professionals we interviewed. They feel the information they provide may impact the decision-making process in the asylum procedure. When they realize the information they provide is subject to rigid immigration policies or may lead to a decision to reject the asylum request, an ethical dilemma arises because the outcome might not be in the best interest of their patient.\n\nThe initial dilemma highlights the trepidations mental health practitioners have in providing medical information to medical advisers. If the outcome of the therapeutic treatment is positive, the medical adviser may conclude that treatment has been successful and is no longer necessary. In this instance, a decision based on Article 64 would be negative. However, if the provided information indicates that treatment is not successful, the medical adviser may conclude that further treatment would prove fruitless. Again, a decision based on Article 64 could be negative:\n\nYou find yourself in a catch 22 situation: if the patient improves, which of course is the aim of the treatment, the medical advisor might say: \u2018Okay, the symptoms are less, we can proceed in returning the person to his country of origin.\u2019 But if the medical condition is not improved, the medical advisor might say: \u2018This treatment is not very effective and won\u2019t lead to better results so you can stop and proceed to return as well.\u2019 The asylum seeker has to deal with a paradox. He wants to get better but then realizes article 64 is no longer applicable in his case and he might have to return. That causes stress and that\u2019s why his complaints don\u2019t go away (R1).\n\nMental health professionals question whether the information they provide to medical advisers will be used in the best interest of their patients. Subsequently, some are reluctant in providing any information at all:\n\nI think it\u2019s very tricky, trying to accomplish anything with the medical information. In fact I don\u2019t know if my patient is entitled to asylum in the first place and trying to influence the procedure is not my task. My task is to interpret the complaints he has and base my diagnoses and treatment on that (F3).\n\nSharing information becomes even more conspicuous in the event that the medical adviser submits a request for a suicide risk assessment. In addition to and despite any pre-existing suicidal factors, suicidal behaviour could also be prompted by the threat of repatriation subsequent to a denied asylum request:\n\nPeople are often very desperate. Suicidal thoughts and acts are often permanent. That creates a dilemma: how should I assess that? I tell you, it\u2019s very complicated when people say: \u2018I\u2019ll kill my child and myself if they sent me back to \u2026\u2019. That assessment is very complicated. Even though I\u2019m trained in the prevention of suicide, which risk can you take and how do you deal with that? It\u2019s a very complicated assessment (R5).\n\nProfessionals understand that, in such a situation, it is of paramount importance to accurately formulate and precisely document all arguments. In doing so, the medical adviser will have sufficient information upon which to make an assessment. Suicide attempts can then be reviewed in the documentation of the patient\u2019s history:\n\nI do notice that in almost all cases in which I reported that my patient will be too vulnerable to survive in his own country, that was helpful for his case but if I can\u2019t come to a conclusion and say with confidence that this is the case, I won\u2019t do it (F4).\n\nConversely, and substantiated by advice received from health care professionals, medical advisers are accountable in the event of an inaccurate assessment of a suicide risk by asylum seekers processed for repatriation. Decisions, and the repercussions thereof, made on the basis of this advice are crucial to all\u2014the mental health care professional, the medical adviser and the asylum seeker.\n\nAdvocacy: Mental health professionals may consider taking a stance for asylum seekers as a collective and raising public awareness in an effort to improve the asylum situation and mental health for all. Mental health professionals are divided on the issue of whether to advocate for rights and more comprehensive policies for asylum seekers. For them, it is unclear whether advocating better policies fall under the auspices of health care professionals and, if so, which disciplines, specifically, would be responsible.\n\nThe participants advocating for improved rights felt obliged to communicate the personal stories of asylum seekers to a broader public:\n\nThis topic is very undefined. The question is what therapists can and should do. I personally think that therapists do have a role in advocacy because they talk to the asylum seekers most. Managers don\u2019t have that kind of contact. But, this creates tension. I think that justice as a value is very important for most therapists but they don\u2019t know how this is achieved. I called the reception centre once to complain about the lack of facilities where my patients could relax. I sent a letter to ask for a better room. This was controversial. I think that we, as professionals, lack the competence to advocate but I do think it\u2019s necessary. A lot of other patients are organized and have collective advocators, but asylum seekers represent different disorders and are not well organized. Organizations like the Refugee Council or a special group within mental health care should do more and advocate not only for the right to health but for better circumstances in general (R6).\n\nSome professionals are aware of organizations in the Netherlands where the advocacy for the rights of asylum seekers is contained in their mission statement. Such organizations include the Refugee Council, the Johannes Wier Foundation and the institute for Human Rights and Medical Assessment (iMMO). Advocacy, in itself, does not preclude ethical dilemmas for care-givers; however, a lack of support or no commitment on behalf of management may lead to a conflict of interest. Justice for patients may conflict with loyalty towards the mental health organization.\n\nThinking about advocacy also affects mental health professionals on a personal level. Some of them mentioned the process of losing their naive idealistic view of Dutch society as multicultural:\n\nI\u2019m not politically active. When I talk to colleagues who do the same kind of job, you get straight. This is what you can expect when you do this kind of work. You have to accept the facts. A majority of the Dutch population voted for this immigration policy. Deal with it. But things have become less open. At birthday parties I don\u2019t tell them I\u2019m working with asylum seekers because they might not feel the same idealism as I do (R2).\n\nIn summary, the discursive reasoning of mental health professionals on ethical dilemmas in 2015 shows that asylum seekers are perceived as a vulnerable group because they live with existential uncertainties under challenging conditions. Mental health professionals have trepidations about their role, especially being drawn into the quagmire of the judicial procedure. This concern leads to a crossroad in terms of providing information about the medical condition of their patients and their role as an advocate.\n\nDiscussion\n\nWhat are the various focal points in ethical dilemmas of mental health professionals from 1995 and 2015, and what are the differences and similarities?\n\nAn Interpretation of the 1998 Document and the 2015 Data\n\nThe mental health professionals cited in the 1998 publication were concerned with the impact of mental health care on the cultural identity and beliefs of asylum seekers. Requesting asylum in a European country and looking for a toehold in their struggle to continue their lives, they came across mental health professionals who could give them the idea that they were not merely survivors of political hardship, but had psychological problems in reprocessing their experiences. From a discursive viewpoint, mental health professionals in 1995 assumed that a medical\u2013psychotherapeutic framework was new to most asylum seekers. Moreover, this train of thought might have diminished a reliance upon their own cultural reservoir in dealing with a tumultuous past.\n\nA second discursive element can be found in the assumption that asylum seekers \u2018missed\u2019 the modernist agenda of the \u2018West\u2019 in the changing thoughts about hierarchical status of mental health professionals. We mentioned the original quotes about West, South and East in the text because it underlines assumptions about the cultural differences of asylum seekers and mental health workers. These cultural differences came to the fore in the concept of informed consent and autonomy. The European Consultation on Ethical Standards in Mental Health Care for Asylum Seekers stated that there should be an increased awareness of these issues. Cultural sensitivity and the awareness of cultural differences between the country of origin and country of settlement should be taken into consideration for the treatment of refugees and displaced persons.\n\nIn short, the main ethical dilemma is the result of forcing asylum seekers to fit into a socio-political system in which they lose, from a psychological perspective, their own sources for resilience. In line with the discursive elements of the \u2018othering\u2019 of asylum seekers, mental health professionals in 1995 stress the importance of intercultural training.\n\nIn 2015, this cultural concern was not present, but the mental health professionals interviewed are concerned about the impact of the social and political conditions on the lives of asylum seekers. Asylum seekers are perceived as a group that may be negatively impacted by living in a host country in which they face uncertainties and poor social conditions. The impact of the length of stay and relocations in reception centres on mental health symptoms of asylum seekers is substantiated by scientific research (Hallas et al. 2007; Goosen et al. 2014).\n\nHere, we see a discursive element of framing asylum seekers as a group in which medical and judicial paradigms are intertwined. This leads to questions about the intentions of asylum seekers when seeking mental health care. Is it possible that, besides or even instead of looking for a cure, asylum seekers register with mental health services because their lawyer may be able to use medical information as extra munition in the asylum request process? Mental health professionals position the help-seeking behaviour of their patients within these social and legal conditions.\n\nIn line with the discursive view of asylum seekers as patients in which medical and judicial elements become a hybrid mix, solutions can be sought in disentangling the medical and judicial framework. It may be helpful for professionals to emphasize that they function solely in a medical capacity and are not responsible for decisions made by the Immigration and Naturalization Office based on medical information they provide. As a way forward, more opportunities for reflection on ethical dilemmas are required in an effort to establish and incorporate applicable ethical deliberations.\n\nAn Explanation for the Shift in Focus from Cultural to Social and Judicial Aspects\n\nIn 1995, the social political context in which mental health care for asylum seekers took place played a role in a preference for a psycho-social, multidisciplinary approach (van Willigen 1998: 108), but judicial aspects were not explicitly mentioned in the contributions of the experts as creating ethical dilemmas. They framed their concerns as medicalization and fear of Western imperialism.\n\nIn the 2015 data, compared to the 1998 document, little or no attention is paid to cultural aspects in mental health care for asylum seekers. Treatment of mental health symptoms is less perceived as a cultural dilemma, and treatment itself is self-evident. However, social living conditions are emphasized as part of ethical dilemmas, as well as legal problems. The role of medical information in the asylum request process has increased.\n\nFrom a human rights perspective, we should mention that equality is a fundamental value, meaning every individual should be respected as agent in a moral, legal and socio-political way (Forst 2011). This equality includes the idea that human beings should be capable of living their lives with dignity (Nussbaum 2006). However, both the 2015 data and the 1998 document run the risk of \u2018othering\u2019 asylum seekers, which strains the value of equality. The 1998 document places asylum seekers in the position of cultural strangers, which required\u2014by that time quite positively formulated\u2014cultural training of professionals. The 2015 data shows how asylum seekers are \u2018othered\u2019 judiciously and politically. Within society as a whole, they are sometimes seen as enemies that threaten our social and political order and/or steal the resources of the inhabitants. The participating health care professionals often saw asylum seekers as victims of these pressing political and judicious conditions. In our view, a human rights perspective requires initially that we do not \u2018other\u2019 asylum seekers or view them as either cultural strangers, enemies or victims, but that we treat them as human beings like ourselves and that we look for commonalities.\n\nIn the past 20 years, there have been major fluctuations in the nationalities of asylum seekers, the duration of the asylum procedure, the facilities provided by the reception centres and the overall political climate. The populist and political discussions in Europe were and are as yet lively.\n\nThe political debate in 2015 was more polarized, ranging from people and political parties that want no asylum seekers at all or limit their number to the bare minimum and others who claim it is the obligation of a nation to offer asylum seekers a safe haven.\n\nPolitical factors and the question of advocacy have become more apparent as doctors or psychologists might be asked by the medical advisers of the immigration authorities to report medical information. Many professionals feel extremely uncomfortable in answering these kind of questions because they feel they have the power to influence the course of the asylum claim of their patient. From the perspective of the mental health professional, providing information to the medical advisers appears brittle and strife-ridden in light of the seemingly strident asylum policies in the Netherlands.\n\nHesitation about Advocacy\n\nMental health professionals may have become even more cautious in advocating for the rights and wellbeing of asylum seekers. The controversy among mental health professionals is whether to advocate for the interests of individual patients or asylum seekers as a group. These issues may also be of a non-medical nature. The controversy exists due to these two factors. Despite some organizations having made advocacy their core business and the inherency of advocacy in the responsibilities of mental health professionals, some professionals feel, as yet, unqualified to act in this capacity. Advocacy is hardly addressed or not at all in the professional training of psychologists and psychiatrists.\n\nUnder a Magnifying Glass\n\nAs a result of the intertwining medical/judicial paradigm, mental health professionals may get the impression that their work and especially reporting the medical condition of their patient to medical advisers of the Immigration and Naturalisation Office are subject to close scrutiny. Respondents often are dismayed at the amount of time required to answer questions by the medical adviser. This is due, in part, to the ethical dilemma of helping their patient and preventing harm by providing incomplete information. Also, the professional may be criticized for partiality, unprofessionalism and the crossing of professional boundaries.\n\nConclusion\n\nA discursive analysis of the ethical dilemmas of mental health professionals concerned with the care for asylum seekers gathered during a European expert meeting in 1995 and an empirical study in 2015 shows that there is a shift from cultural factors to a broader focus on social, political and legal factors. Mental health professionals often perceive a conflict of values. Therefore, guidelines have been developed, providing a framework for reflecting on the inherent ethical dilemmas individual care-givers must weigh (Kramer et al. 2015). Remaining aligned with professional standards regarding diagnoses and treatment helps, but does not preclude mental health professionals having sleepless nights when they feel they cannot honour different values simultaneously. Mental health professionals should think twice before they decide that asylum seekers are different and/or need to be treated differently. Meanwhile, efforts should be made by mental health care professionals, policy makers and others involved in the care for asylum seekers to be respectful and provide adequate and appropriate care.\n\nADAMS K.

Self-care as an Accepted Practice was the fourth in a series of 18 forums the libraries are hosting for their Issues that Matter: Let\u2019s Talk Mental Health initiative.\n\nWednesday evening\u2019s forum focused on increasing the awareness of self-care \u2014 a relatively new mental health practice \u2014 and its role in mental health. A resource sheet distributed at the event defines self-care as \u201ca practice focused on achieving and maintaining physical and mental health. Self-care involves recognizing one\u2019s own needs and establishing strategies or routines to meet and fulfill them to lead a healthy, productive, and enjoyable life.\u201d\n\nFamily therapist and author Sarri Gilman, who facilitated the forum, noted in opening remarks that \u201cHistorically self-care is very new to our language and our culture. It entered our culture in the 1970s from the nursing profession.\u201d Gillman went on to say that self-care \u201chas really grown in momentum as we start to understand that it is foundational to everybody\u2019s well-being and health.\u201d\n\nDuring the evening, presenters frequently returned to a central theme of balance \u2014 specifically the need to balance all the major areas of our lives. A \u201cSelf-care Wheel\u201d resource identified Physical, Psychological, Emotional, Spiritual, Personal and Professional as key life segments that require self-care. Gilman suggested also adding segments for Friends, Nature and Creativity, and encouraged the forum\u2019s attendees to write self-care tips and strategies from the evening\u2019s discussion on the appropriate segment of the wheel. The core message was that all the life areas on the wheel are important and require attention and self-care. If any of the segments are ignored, life becomes unbalanced and happiness and quality of life suffers.\n\nGilman was joined by three panelists who shared self-care tips, strategies and resources. Mental health counselor Amber Saldivar spoke of the importance of thinking about your own needs, noting that often it\u2019s \u201chard to say no to the needs and demands of others.\u201d\n\nIn response to the question, \u201cHow do you fit time for self-care into your life?\u201d Saldivar responded that there is a natural tendency to think \u201cI can rest after I get everything done.\u201d However, typically, she said\u201cthis never happens.\u201d Her self-care tip was to be sure you \u201ctake regular breaks even when you still have things to do on your list.\u201d Strategies she uses include setting an alarm during the day to remind her to take regular breaks, and she takes a 10-minute work break every hour. She also goes on two personal weekend retreats every year to recharge. In addition, Saldivar noted that getting enough sleep and rest is a key self-care requirement.\n\nPanelist Saranne Moreschi, a retired educator and a Family-to-Family instructor with the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), made the point that almost everyone is affected by mental illness, either through their own struggles or the struggles of a child, parent, spouse, grandparent, grandchild, sibling or friend.\n\nMany people are also caregivers for a loved one with mental illness or another chronic health problem, making it difficult to focus on their own self-care. Moreschi observed that \u201cfamily members and caregivers must take care of themselves too, or else burn out,\u201d advising that \u201ccaregivers who pay attention to their own physical and emotional health are better able to handle the challenges of supporting someone with mental illness.\u201d\n\nShe went on to explain that \u201cit\u2019s like the advice given in airplanes. You must put on your own oxygen mask before you try to help someone with theirs. Taking care of yourself is a valid goal on its own, but it will also help you to support the people you love who need your care.\u201d\n\nMoreschi presented NAMI\u2019s \u201c7 Principles of Living a Balanced Life,\u201d a set of self-care principles and strategies for anyone caring for someone with mental illness or other chronic health problems.\n\nDo as much as you can financially and physically to improve the situation\n\nStrive for good physical health\n\nWatch your stress level\n\nMaintain social contacts\n\nSeek out and join a support group\n\nContinue pursuing your own interests.\n\nDo something for someone else; give back\n\nMaintaining social contacts was specifically called out by the panel as one of the most important self-care principles. Studies have shown that people who are the happiest have six hours or more of social contact each day.\n\nIvette Bayo Urban, a doctoral candidate in the University of Washington Information School, addressed the stresses that modern technology brings to self-care, noting the constant pressures and distractions of email and social media. A technology-related self-care strategy that Bayo Urban uses is to turn off email notifications on her phone when she isn\u2019t working. This forces her to make a conscious effort to check her email, rather than being constantly interrupted by incoming work emails when she wants to focus on other important non-work areas of her life. Bayo Urban stressed the importance of cutting technology out for part of the day to focus on loved ones.\n\nHow do you get started? Sarri Gilman recommended that people commit to a small amount of self-care time every day, then expand the time. \u201cIf you are at zero, get to 15 minutes a day. Fifteen minutes a day is what we call the \u201cturning point\u201d in all the research.\u201d The panelists acknowledged that they started small, but now spend an average of an hour or two per day on self-care. A few examples of self-care that were mentioned by the panelists included meditating, taking a walk, exercising, reading, prayer, sewing and other hobbies and calling a friend on the phone.\n\nSno-Isle Libraries has published a list of recommended mental health books and other resources to complement the forum on their Issues That Matter: Let\u2019s Talk Mental Health web page. This include books about general mental health, responding to crises, and the state of mental health services in the U.S., and links to local and national organizations that provide mental health services and information.\n\nWednesday night\u2019s forum was recorded, and an audio recording and video will be posted on the Sno-Isle Libraries\u2019 website. The libraries will host additional forums in the mental health series during the first half of 2018.

In other words, the resources that need to be spent to treat and to prevent these conditions are just not being spent either in the private sector or the public sector,\" said Hickling, the executive director of the Caribbean Institute of Mental Health and Substance Abuse.\n\n\"It is worse in the public sector because it is really poor people who require that investment, and it's not that the Government of both stripes doesn't know. They have been told exactly what is needed and what resources are needed to bring about the change that is necessary, yet over the years, they have paid us no mind,\" said Hickling.\n\nHIGHER LEVEL OF DISCOURSE\n\nHe asserted that the discourse around the subject of mental illness in Jamaica must be taken to a higher level, with the strict understanding that much more is needed by way of financial support to deal with the situation. Hickling indicated that mental illness was being manifested in the country's runaway murder rate and the explicit antisocial behaviours witnessed daily in the public sphere, among other places.\n\nAs of December 2, more than 1,492 people have been murdered. The St James Police Division accounts for the majority, with more than 310 people killed, surpassing the record 265 recorded for all of last year.\n\n'A third of population suffers from mental disorder'\n\nProfessor Frederick Hickling has said that nearly 41 per cent of the Jamaican population is eligible for a personality disorder diagnosis.\n\nAdditionally, he said that it may be that more than a third of the population suffers from one form of mental disorder or has suffered from it at some stage in their lives.\n\n\"And even then, the Government really has not paid us any mind. They certainly don't see this as very important, but the study from our psychiatrists and psychologists show the distinct link between the country's current state of indiscipline and mental illnesses,\" noted Hickling.\n\nHe said that approximately 15 per cent of the population has what is described as severe anti-social personality disorder, with the others being moderate and mild disorders.\n\nWhat people call madness is really psychosis, and schizophrenic psychosis represents about three to four per cent of the society, data shows.\n\npaul.clarke@gleanerjm.com", "image": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/sites/default/files/styles/250px/public/media/article_images/2017/12/07/MentalHealthF20171207IA.jpg?itok=Gm-KfWA6", "subject": "mental health"}, "42b89eeba83e68b9cc9a0411d74891a1": {"title": "Report: Mental health patients in Texas often forced out-of-network", "summary": "AUSTIN (Nexstar) - While a 2008 federal law was established to ensure health insurance issuers provide equal coverage of mental health or substance use disorder treatment as they would for physical care, a new report shows patients are still facing challenges in accessing services.

Researchers from Milliman analyzed medical claims records for preferred provider organizations (PPOs) from 2013 to 2015.\n\nIn 2015, Texas patients had to turn out of network almost five times more for in-patient addiction and mental health care compared to physical treatment.\n\nNidia Heston says she knows from working with other families and her own experience finding the right provider is step one in a long journey. Heston\u2019s 15-year-old son was diagnosed with autism at age two. At age six, doctors diagnosed him with ADHD, and when he turned 10, they diagnosed him with bipolar disorder.\n\nShe says families on Medicaid often have limited options, insurance won\u2019t cover care or sometimes providers may not take private insurance.\n\n\u201cA lot of providers will give you a billing form that you can submit to your insurance company, but with a lot of deductibles being \u2013 I mean, our deductible is $2,000, $3,000 \u2013 out-of-network that\u2019s even a lot of times double that,\u201d Heston said.\n\nHeston said being forced out-of-network often becomes unaffordable for families.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really terrible that families have to make the choice between medications, sometimes food, electricity and finding a good provider,\u201d she said.\n\nCopyright 2017 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

(Photo Courtesy: Nidia Heston)\n\nGreg Hansch, public policy director for NAMI Texas, said the unequal access to treatment for people with mental illnesses is a significant challenge that can be attributed to several factors.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t enough providers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe insurance networks aren\u2019t robust enough. People with mental illness often end up paying more out of pocket than people with other health conditions.\u201d\n\nCathryn Donaldson, director of communications for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, also points to the shortage of behavioral health providers nationwide.\n\n\u201cIf an in-network provider is not available, health plans do cover out-of-network care as in-network,\u201d Donaldson said. \u201cThey also actively recruit behavioral health clinicians, help patients navigate the system to ensure care coordination and monitor the availability of appointments and help members get appointments when needed.\u201d\n\nThe Milliman report also found in 2015, behavioral health providers in Texas were also getting paid 20-30 percent less than primary care providers.\n\nDonaldson said mental health parity doesn\u2019t immediately translate to equal payment of providers.\n\n\u201cJust as provider reimbursement rates, which are negotiated between health insurers and providers, will vary on the medical and surgical side, provider rates on the behavioral health side will vary based on the health specialty, local market dynamics and the insurance provider,\u201d Donaldson said.\n\n\u201cWe need to be facilitating participation in the health insurance market for providers as much as possible,\u201d Hansch said.\n\nDuring the 2017 legislative session, lawmakers passed HB 10, which gives the Texas Department of Insurance the ability to enforce the federal parity law for health insurance plans under the state. The legislation also requires data collection so state agencies can compare how access to insurance benefits looks for people with mental illness in comparison to people with other health conditions.\n\nIt also formed the Mental Health Condition and Substance Use Disorder Parity Workgroup. Members of the workgroup include the Office of Mental Health Coordination at the Health and Human Services Commission, the Texas Department of Insurance and hospitals. Texans who face problems when trying to access behavioral health services can also reach out to designated staff at the Office of the Ombudsman at HHSC.\n\nHeston encourages families to speak up if they ever have questions about mental health services.\n\n\u201cThere are families who are willing to share their resources and how they\u2019ve been able to manage things,\u201d she said.", "image": "http://static.lakana.com/nxsglobal/feedsite/photo/2017/12/08/707cabdaed494573971b3e007e8a57a9_30002816_ver1.0_640_360.jpg", "subject": "mental health"}, "0b2884f18d7cf919f371a8ddf06eb574": {"title": "Seven Ways to Diffuse Holiday Stress", "summary": "This may be the most wonderful time of the year, but it can also be the most stressful.

More than half of U.S. workers say they are happier on the job during the holidays, but 35% admit they\u2019re more stressed this time of year, according to a new survey from staffing firm Accountemps.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe holidays are a microcosm of how stress evolves, says Stephanie Marston, coauthor of Type R: Transformative Resilience for Thriving in a Turbulent World. \u201cThe holidays bring things into focus in an acute way,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are trying to make the season joyful and perfect, but our work stresses may be greater than they were previously. We probably feeling like the world around us is spinning out of control, and it\u2019s hard to not feel some sense of impending doom.\u201d Balancing holiday events and work obligations was ranked as the most stressful part of the holiday season, according to the Accountemps survey. Instead of feeling the frenzy, try these seven ways to cope. 1. Embrace the Season It\u2019s tempting to grit your teeth and bear it, but you can also use the season as a time to grow, learn, and evolve, says Marston. Instead of looking forward to getting back to normal after the holidays, consider the faster pace a new normal, taking the time to identify and reflect on your stress trigger point. \u201cThe holidays bring more of everything, good and bad,\u201d says Marston. \u201cLook at it as an opportunity to do things differently, and then carry that into the New Year.\u201d 2. Create Separation Focusing on a long personal to-do list, such as shopping, wrapping gifts, attending parties, and hosting events during work hours can lead to anxiety and hurt productivity, says Michael Steinitz, executive director of Accountemps. Instead, set boundaries around your time. \u201cIf you want to check off items from your personal to-do list during the workday, use your lunch break to grocery shop or run errands,\u201d he says. \u201cOr use vacation days to give yourself some extra time for personal errands. It\u2019s also a good idea to take time off for yourself and recharge before the New Year.\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nBefore leaving work, write down your top priorities to accomplish the next day, suggests Steinitz. \u201cKeep work and personal to-do\u2019s separate, which will help you manage projects, improve productivity, and reduce stress during the holidays,\u201d he says. 3. Be Vocal Meet with your manager to discuss possible solutions to alleviate work pressure. For example, adjust deadlines, delegate assignments to others, or bring in temporary help, suggests Steinitz. Sometimes just voicing concerns can alleviate stress, adds Marston. \u201cIdentify how you need to adjust work plans to be better aligned with your team and the world around you,\u201d she says. 4. Maintain Realistic Expectations During the holidays it\u2019s easy to get caught in a tug-of-war between what we want things to be and what they are, and what we want and what we are able to do, says Marston. \u201cFeelings and expectations of Norman Rockwell bliss are heightened during the holidays, and stress is natural even for most balanced among us,\u201d she says. \u201cGet your priorities straight and have realistic expectations.\u201d One way to do this is to determine what can wait. \u201cBecause of year-end reviews we often spend the end of year stressing to wrap up back-burner projects, knowing full well something\u2019s going to give,\u201d she says. \u201cAsk yourself, \u2018Is this a high-level impact project or something that\u2019s second tier?\u2019 Think about putting off what you can do tomorrow. Some things can be delayed.\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\n5. Schedule Down Time It sounds counterintuitive when there\u2019s a lot on your list, but schedule time to decompress and debrief. Remind yourself by setting your phone for an alert twice a day: late morning and late afternoon. \u201cSmall breaks throughout the day help maintain sanity,\u201d says Marston. Take a walk, or listen to music. Telecommute one day or two. Or simply close your office door and find quiet time. Marston suggests taking a deep breath to the count of three, three times in a row, with three rounds. \u201cDuring the third round, double the length of your exhalation,\u201d she says. \u201cThis activates the physical relax response.\u201d 6. Express Appreciation Gratitude stimulates the hypothalamus, an area of the brain that regulates stress, and produces a pleasure sensation, according to research published in the medical journal Cerebral Cortex. Expressing appreciation for the little things will give you higher satisfaction with your job and coworkers, says Marston. Find ways to praise your team, say \u201cthank you,\u201d and be of service to others. In addition, reframe thoughts that make you feel irritated, says Marston. \u201cGive people the benefit of the doubt, and accept that we\u2019re all more stressed than usual,\u201d she says. \u201cInstead of judging, which is so easy for us to do, focus on learning new ways to relate with them. By being more curious you\u2019ll persist in face of setbacks.\u201d\n\nadvertisement", "image": "https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_1280,f_auto,q_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2017/12/p-1-seven-ways-to-diffuse-holiday-stress.jpg", "subject": "stress"}, "30887151caa6169fcc3cc4e3c539483e": {"title": "Liverpool v Everton: Tony Bellew on &#39;a day of torment and stress&#39;", "summary": "Everton have not won at Anfield since Kevin Campbell scored the only goal way back in September 1999.

We have won just four times at Goodison Park since 1999. We've gone 13 games without a win - and lost seven of those.\n\nWe don't get good results against Liverpool, and Anfield is a nightmare place to go.\n\nFor Everton and their supporters the derby is just a day of torment and stress.\n\nKevin Campbell had six years at Everton - and scored the only goal in their 1-0 win at Anfield in 1999\n\nWhat hurts more - getting punched or derby defeat?\n\nGetting punched hurts, I'm not going to lie - it's physical pain.\n\nFootball is emotional pain, it's heartache, shame, embarrassment and that hurt can last a lot longer.\n\nI've never been knocked out but I've been stopped on my feet.\n\nA knockout may not hurt because of the adrenaline but getting bounced 3-0 or 4-0 and Steven Gerrard scoring a hat-trick?

It's on your mind all the time. I don't get nervous for fighting, believe it or not I actually enjoy it.\n\nI was nervous before my fight at Goodison Park last year, when I won the WBC cruiserweight title, but that's because the preparation hadn't gone as well as I'd have liked.\n\nGoing to the match, as I am on Sunday, is a different feeling. During derby week I'm constantly nervous because I'm not in control, whereas in boxing my destiny is in my own hands.\n\nI relax and do nothing on the day of a fight. I might do a little bit of clothes shopping as that helps relax me.\n\nI spend derby day walking up and down my house talking to myself, praying that we can get a result, that a ball goes in off someone's backside, anything to get that result. I spend the day begging basically.\n\nWhen I'm at the game I'm just like any other fan - I could be a bin man or a boxer, my profession doesn't come into it.

I'm a prize fighter - I get punched in the face for a living.\n\nBut I can tell him this - if Everton win, he'll be immortalised, he really will.\n\nAllardyce is a man who understands what needs to be done. I'm hoping and praying for some kind of result, some kind of reaction from the lads.\n\nThe result of this match means more than anyone can grasp or understand. Everton winning at Anfield is massive.\n\nAllardyce must understand the effect it will have on his position as Everton manager if he wins at Liverpool's home. If he wins there, the fans will take to him super-quick.\n\nIf anyone can win at Anfield, it's him. He knows how to grind results out. He's won there with lesser teams than Everton, he won there with Crystal Palace and they didn't have the quality on the park that we have.\n\nBut Liverpool are, for me, barring Manchester City, the best attacking side in the Premier League. They're electric going forward. They're deadly.\n\nOne sniff, they're in on goal. Their strengths going forward far outweigh ours.\n\nI know in the past two league games we've done well, but don't be deceived.\n\nWe've beaten West Ham and Huddersfield - two teams that have actually been worse than us recently, which is saying something this season.\n\nI'm just hoping Sam's ethos on defending comes across in Sunday's game.

That is all I care about. All I want to do is win and that is the most important thing for me.\n\nIf we are winning, I'm happy.\n\nI'm just hoping for the best on Sunday and if he can play a part in Everton getting a good result, then there is no problem for me.\n\nTony Bellew was speaking to BBC Sport's Craig Lowe.", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/composite-logo/0123/production/_99119200_bellewgetty.jpg", "subject": "stress"}, "8ac812673d5b2d5e8b8f43e5174dae6a": {"title": "High-Stress Pregnancies Slow Childhood Development, Study Warns", "summary": "Pregnancies can be stressful, but stressing over a pregnancy leads to even more stress\u2014and new research on the subject highlights the importance of keeping stress under control during this critical time.

A recent study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggests that high stress levels in pregnant mothers can physically alter the health of their unborn children\u2014opening the doors to new discoveries about infant abnormalities, infant underdevelopment, and how to combat the many health complications that can accompany childbirth, endangering both mothers and their offspring.\n\nResearchers from The University of New Mexico, the University of G\u00f6ttingen, Germany, and the German Primate Center teamed up in a project that aimed to hypothesize why the developments of disadvantaged offspring are so variable. Comparative research across 719 studies and 21 different species of mammal allowed the team to identify various prenatal stressors and how they affected mammal fetuses\u2014with one of the most prevalent being emotional stress.\n\nHow can emotional stress change the biological development of an unborn child? Put simply, stress uses up a larger amount of the body\u2019s energy sources, leaving less energy to contribute to fetal development. \u201cThe idea is that prenatal stress affects offspring in two different ways, depending on the timing of the stressor during pregnancy\u2014yielding different outcomes before birth, after birth, and after weaning,\u201d said evolutionary anthropologist and lead study author Andreas Bergh\u00e4nel.\n\nThe two types of stress Bergh\u00e4nel refers to are prenatal maternal stress and maternal stress. Prenatal maternal stress, which occurs late in gestation, results in slower fetal growth in the womb due to a lack of energy. Maternal stress, occurring after birth while infants are still dependent on their mothers, can result in a lack of development in the early stages due to lack of nutrition within breast milk.\n\nHow severely can the negative effects of maternal stress play out during a child\u2019s lifetime? According to the researchers, a disadvantaged developmental phase, whether prenatal or maternal, can result in repercussions throughout adolescence and even into adulthood. When prevented with challenging circumstances, disadvantaged, underdeveloped infants often transition into a quickened pace of development\u2014nature\u2019s way of trying to make sure it can reproduce before death.\n\n\u201cThese new results may bear some translational value for understanding why girls start their menstrual cycles earlier in poorer neighborhoods,\u201d said Bergh\u00e4nel. The researchers speculate that the nutrient-lacking breast milk of stressed mothers may also explain why underprivileged offspring switch into high-speed development mode before others\u2014in order to survive, offspring need to adapt in order seek out stable sources of nourishment.\n\nWhile new research connecting childhood development to stress may be rattling, the main takeaway is that stress-related complications can be avoided; consulting your doctor over these risk factors and stress management techniques will help protect the long-term health of you and your baby.", "image": "http://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/hannah-tasker-333889-1.jpg?quality=80&w=1200&strip", "subject": "stress"}, "c0b81aae0ec0018e30b4b91d07893cc4": {"title": "Workplace violence, psychological stress, sleep quality and subjective health in Chinese doctors", "summary": "Objectives This study had three objectives: (1) to identify the incidence rate of WPV against doctors under a new classification, (2) to examine the association between exposure to WPV, psychological stress, sleep quality and subjective health of Chinese doctors and (3) to verify the partial mediating role&nbsp;...", "url": "http://bmjopen.bmj.com/cgi/content/short/7/12/e017182?rss=1", "date": "2017-12-08T07:25:51Z", "text": "Strengths and limitations of this study The prevalence of three new accessorial types of workplace violence is conducted in this study, with high response rates.\n\nThis is the first study investigating the relationship between workplace violence and psychological stress, sleep quality and self-reported health of doctors in China.\n\nThe finding that psychological stress partially mediated the relationship between work-related violence and health damage is first reported.\n\nThe approach to self-reports of doctors in an online survey may lead to response bias.\n\nThe results of the study are not generalisable to all Chinese doctors.\n\nIntroduction A decade ago, China\u2019s government launched a new round of health system reforms. So far, the medical care insurance system and public health system have been built. In addition, more attention has been paid to the development of primary health services.1 Although these reforms have achieved much in China, it is still difficult for residents to get medical services, and healthcare costs have been rising exponentially.1 More importantly, Chinese doctors and patients both do not feel that they have profited from the previous series of reforms. On the contrary, the doctor\u2013patient relationship seems to have been deteriorating lately.2 In China, the human resources for health are seriously insufficient, and inequalities exist at the same time.3 Moreover, there is an imbalance in the resources\u2019 structure. For example, the highest quality of health resources are concentrated in large cities, whereas Chinese primary healthcare is still very weak.4 As a consequence, people tend to flock to public tertiary general hospitals. Unfortunately, the current medical care insurance system cannot relieve the catastrophic health expenditure,5 and residents often complain about high medical costs. Along with the factors social change, incompetent medical education and lack of professionalism in medical staff, most doctors are only busy with aspects of technical problems; all of which result in a lack of awareness at the humanistic level during the process of service.6 This is an important reason why the doctor\u2013patient relationship is not harmonious in China.7 Owing to the price of medical services and technology and income under strictly government-controlled conditions, there is an unreasonable phenomenon where doctors\u2019 benefits from medical technology are very low in China. Contrary to what the government wishes, in order to make a profit, some Chinese doctors try to provide unreasonable prescriptions for the patients to earn more money8; some often communicating unlawfully with drug/medical appliance dealers. Naturally, the Chinese government attaches much importance to this problem, and many relevant policies have been introduced to solve these issues. Regardless, this phenomenon has caused a large number of adverse effects. Doctor\u2013patient relationships are becoming more and more fragile in China,7 and most patients already do not trust doctors, including all other healthcare staff. In recent years, many doctors have been assaulted, seriously injured and even murdered by patients or visitors in China. Consequently, doctors are at high risk of serious injury or death in hospital settings caused by attacks from patients. Workplace violence (WPV) against doctors has already become a public health issue and a very common phenomenon in China.9 Unfortunately, the reports of these incidents by the media have further exacerbated the conflict between doctors and patients.10 Therefore, the occupational safety of Chinese doctors has come to a very grave juncture.\n\nBackground WPV against healthcare workers is known as violence in healthcare settings, including the violent acts that are directed towards doctors, nurses or other healthcare staff at work or on duty.11 According to a survey, the prevalence of violence against emergency physicians in Morocco was 70%,12 in South Africa the proportion of personnel that had encountered violence rose to 61% and in Thailand, 54%.13 In Jordan, a survey of nurses in the emergency department showed that 75% of emergency had experienced violence, among which verbal violence was the most common phenomenon, accounting for 63.9%, and physical violence accounted for 48%.14 It has become an increasingly serious public health problem worldwide but is more common in China15 and has attracted considerable attention and global discussion.16 It is noteworthy that in recent years, WPV has become rampant and is an extensive problem in Chinese healthcare settings. However, it is also an ubiquitous, under-reported and persistent problem that has been tolerated and largely ignored.17 Since 2002 in China, there is growing evidence that the incidence rate of WPV in healthcare settings has been increasing annually18 and that the number of incidents of serious violence towards doctors is growing rapidly.19 These findings demonstrate that China\u2019s doctors are facing a severe threat to occupational safety. Furthermore, previous studies indicated that exposure to WPV in healthcare settings could lead to adverse consequences for health professionals, such as a decline in job performance,20 increased turnover intentions and reduced job satisfaction,21 greater stress and burnout,22 low quality of life23 and so on. Moreover, exposure to violence has a negative effect on the health of hospital staff,24 and due to the rise of occupational stress, their family life and quality of life are affected as well.25 Research on WPV in healthcare settings has been widely carried out and revealed antecedent and consequence variables in many previous studies.26 27 However, most research focused only on physical or psychological violence, the two types of violence that represent only the tip of the iceberg. Classically, WPV is defined by the WHO as \u2018the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, that either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or deprivation\u2019.28 According to this definition, obscure WPV tends to cause psychological harm, maldevelopment or deprivation in the practices of Chinese healthcare workers. A number of studies already reported about non-physical violence against healthcare workers and its effects.29 30 Surprisingly, these types of violence were not considered in previous Chinese investigations. Thus, a wider range of types should be discussed for violence against healthcare workers. Still, it is generally known that WPV can cause a large number of adverse outcomes, which have been verified widely, including personal, organisational and social-level outcomes. However, there is not enough evidence to test the link between exposure to WPV against doctors, psychological stress, sleep quality and health status in China. This study aims to identify the incidence rate of WPV against doctors under a new classification by conducting a cross-sectional online survey; to examine the association between exposure to WPV, psychological stress, sleep quality and subjective health of Chinese doctors; and verify the partial mediating role of psychological stress.\n\nMethods Subjects and procedures An anonymous online questionnaire was completed by doctors throughout the country during May 2016 in China. This cross-sectional study was conducted across 30 provinces of China. First, approximately 50 doctors from the authors\u2019 unit were selected as the original deliverers of the survey. Subsequently, the colleagues or classmates of \u2018the original deliverers\u2019 were invited to participate in our online survey. A web page link to our questionnaire survey (https://www.wenjuan.com/) was sent by mobile phone to subjects during doctors\u2019 rest breaks. Moreover, the questionnaires were self-administered. A total of 3016 participants were invited in this survey. Ultimately, 2617 valid questionnaires were used in the final data analysis. The effective response rate was 86.8%. The research described in this article meets the guidelines of the Ethics Committee of the College of Public Health, Harbin Medical University, and the project has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the Harbin Medical University (ECHMU). Written informed consent could not be received due to the anonymous survey approach. Hence, oral informed consent for the survey was approved by the ECHMU and obtained from each doctor. Once a questionnaire was completed, it was identified that the doctor has orally agreed to participate in our survey by reference to the Wen\u2019s criteria.19 Measures Measurement of the WPV against doctors This study used a new measurement tool developed by Zhang to assess the prevalence of WPV.31 Under the new classification, WPV was divided into seven dimensions, including verbal violence (abuse, sarcasm, indignity, effrontery, roar and so on), made difficulties (nit-picking demands, unreasonable requests, non-compliance, heckling and so on), smear reputation (baseless charges or complaints, slander, impudence for damaging reputation and so on), mobbing behaviour (destruction of public facilities, booing, gather together to stir up trouble, public disorder, malicious camera shooting and so on), intimidation behaviour (oral or written threats, glower, waving a clenched fist, threatening with weapons, stalking and so on), physical violence (biting, pushing, fighting, cutting, throwing things towards body and so on) and sexual harassment (also including rape or attempts to rape). Until now, made difficulties, smear repuztation and mobbing behaviour had been seriously neglected in previous studies. On the contrary, these behaviours very commonly trouble Chinese doctors at work, and exposure to such violence may lead to a great stress for doctors and threaten their well-being. Most importantly, these mistreatment behaviours completely meet the standards for the definition and scope of WPV. In the present survey, we used a 6-point Likert scale, with \u2018never\u2019, rarely\u2019, \u2018occasionally\u2019, \u2018often\u2019, \u2018frequently\u2019 and \u2018every day\u2019, to reflect the frequencies of work-related violence against doctors. At the time of questionnaire coding, \u2018never\u2019 and \u2018rarely\u2019 were regarded as non-experience of WPV from patients or their relatives. Thus, they were assigned a score of \u20180\u2019. Other situations were assigned a score of \u20181\u2019, signifying that these doctors have encountered this type of violence during the past year. The Cronbach\u2019s alpha for the scale was 0.885 in this survey. Measurement of psychological stress, sleep quality and subjective health With reference to previous research, psychological stress24 was used as an item to measure the perceived pressure of doctors, rated on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 to 5 (1=not at all, 5=very much). Two single items were addressed together to measure doctors\u2019 self-reported health outcomes (sleep quality and subjective health). Subjective sleep quality32 was measured by using one item, namely, \u2018How would you evaluate this night\u2019s sleep?\u2019, the response format for which ranged from very bad (1) to very good (4). Additionally, our study consulted the research of Fein and Skinner33 and estimated overall subjective health by a widely used single-item measure (\u2018In general, would you say your health is very good, good, poor, very poor\u2019). Moreover, this study also captured several demographic details of participants, such as: gender, age, service years, hospital level, marital status, educational categories and so on. Statistical analysis Demographic characteristics of the respondents were collected to report sample information. Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients were calculated to estimate correlations between the exposure to WPV, psychological stress, sleep quality and self-subjective health. Multiple hierarchical linear regression analysis was performed to test the effects of groups of independent variables on dependent variables. The demographic variables related to WPV in univariate analysis (p<0.05) were entered into step 1 of the hierarchical regression analysis model to eliminate their interference on the dependent variables. A series of regression analyses were performed to examine our hypotheses according to a procedure that was suggested by Baron and Kenny.34 The Sobel Test was used in mediation analysis by adopting Preacher\u2019s test programme.35 We provided data including F, R2 and R2-changes, and the fit of the model was assessed with R2. Standardisation regression coefficients (\u03b2) and p values were calculated for each step in the regression model. In this study, statistical significance was set at p<0.05 (two tailed). All of the above analyses were conducted using SPSS V.13.0 for Windows.\n\nResults Demographic characteristics of the respondents A summary of demographic variables can be seen in table 1. Table 1 Characteristics of the respondents (n=2617) Prevalence of different styles of WPV against doctors As shown in table 2, about 76.2% of participants reported having encountered verbal violence within the last 12 months, which is the highest incidence rate among all kinds of WPV in hospitals. Other incidence rates of WPV from highest to lowest are: made difficulties (58.3%), smear reputation (40.8%), mobbing behaviour (40.2%), intimidation behaviour (27.6%), physical violence (24.1%) and sexual harassment (7.8%). Table 2 The incidence rate and rank ordering of WPV against doctors within last 12 months Incidence rate of accumulated types of expose to WPV against doctors As shown in table 3, 83.4% of participants reported having experienced one or more types of WPV during the last 12 months, which indicates that the prevalence of WPV against doctors in China is 83.4%. Furthermore, 18.8% of participants reported having suffered one type of violence, 14.9% of participants reported having encountered two types of violence, 14.1% of participants reported having experienced three types of violence, 11.7% of participants reported having suffered four types of violence, 9.8% of participants reported having suffered five types of violence, 10.0% of participants reported having suffered six types of violence and 4.0% of participants reported having suffered seven types of violence. Table 3 Incidence rate of accumulated types of WPV against doctors within the last 12 months Correlations between study variables The means, SDs and Pearson correlation coefficients of continuous variables are shown in table 4. As the results demonstrate, all variables were significantly correlated with each other. WPV was positively correlated with psychological stress (r=0.382, p<0.001) and negatively associated with subjective sleep quality (r=\u22120.281, p<0.001) and subjective health (r=\u22120.471, p<0.001). Psychological stress was negatively related to subjective sleep quality (r=\u22120.281, p<0.001) and subjective health (r=\u22120.464, p<0.001). Table 4 Means (M), SDs and correlations of variables Multiple hierarchical linear regression models of study variables To evaluate the association between the exposure to WPV, psychological stress, sleep quality and health status of doctors, we relied on the three-step mediated regression approach that Baron and Kenny34 recommend. Results of mediation analysis are shown in table 5 and illustrated that psychological stress is a partial mediator in the relationship between violence and sleep quality. Moreover, psychological stress also partially mediated the relationship between violence and subjective health. Table 5 Multiple hierarchical linear regression models of variables\n\nDiscussion New styles and prevalence of WPV against doctors in China This study discovered that the incidence rate of WPV against Chinese doctors was 83.4%, similar to previous reports.36 Of all participants in this survey, most have encountered and been victims of at least two styles of violence in the last 12 months. Specifically, exposure to verbal violence was most frequently reported by Chinese doctors with a rate of 76.2%. This result is consistent with previous studies.36 37 Results in the present study demonstrate that Chinese doctors extensively suffer WPV from patients or their relatives. However, compared with the previous literature, this study specially contributes to the understanding of the types of WPV. Made difficulties, smear reputation and mobbing behaviour were proposed first in this study, and it verified that the three new styles of violence defined in our study appeared to be more common than physical violence in hospital settings. Their respective incidence rates were 58.3% (rank 2), 40.8% (rank 3) and 40.2% (rank 4). Additionally, the incidence rate of physical violence and sexual harassment was 24.1% and 7.8%, respectively. Indeed, physical violence must inflict greater harm on the doctors, but the type of widespread violence found in this study is more likely to harm healthcare staff continually. The adverse effects of WPV against doctors and the partial mediatory effects of psychological stress As its name implies, WPV threatens the well-being of doctors, which we have demonstrated in our findings. Consistent with previous observations,38 exposure to WPV had a negative influence on Chinese doctors\u2019 subjective sleep quality and health status. There is reciprocal causation between the doctor\u2013patient relationship and violence towards doctors.2 Although previous literature has discussed numerous causes of WPV and specially their unique characteristics in China, it is not the focus of our discussion.39 However, it is undeniably true that the level of tension in the doctor\u2013patient relationship has further intensified following the increase of WPV.19 40 It is incredible to see that some Chinese netizens unexpectedly support these violent events41 and a gradual formation of hatred towards doctors among Chinese patients; thus, the doctor\u2013patient relationship has reached an unprecedentedly poor condition. Under these circumstances, Chinese doctors tend to specifically allocate much of their attention in dealing with the doctor\u2013patient relationship, in order to protect themselves against violence from patients or patients\u2019 relatives. Therefore, doctors need to carefully express every word and input more \u2018emotional labour\u201942 when they directly face the patient or relatives to avoid the complain. In order to avoid exposure to WPV, Chinese doctors are prone to invest more resources such as extra time and energy in dealing with the doctor\u2013patient relationship.43 On the one hand, the resource investment represents the accumulative job demands of a doctor; on the other hand, they suffer from the patient\u2019s violence. In this case, two aspects may trigger feelings of distress and outrage in a doctor. It is an inequitable cost\u2013reward evaluation of a doctor\u2019s professional and emotional investment, resulting in a process of resource depletion for the doctor. This state of resource depletion is closely related to stress, burnout and depression.44 More than that, a large number of previous studies have shown that effort\u2013reward imbalance can lead to adverse health outcomes.45 46 Several longitudinal studies had proved that the relationship between violence and stress is circular: violence causes stress and stressed workers are prone to exposure to violence.47 48 Psychological stress caused by exposure to WPV is more likely to further lead to sleep disturbance and health damage for a doctor. It is an innovative contribution to research on exposure to WPV in a medical setting. Limitations Although there are significant discoveries in the present study, it has several limitations. First, a convenient sample was used, which risks the potential for sampling bias. Second, its cross-sectional nature prevented the establishment of a causal relationship between variables. Therefore, one important suggestion is that longitudinal studies should be conducted in the future. Third, the data were collected from the self-reports of doctors in an online survey, which may have led to response bias due to social desirability or negative effect. The doctors might have overestimated or underestimated the association between the study variables. Fourth, a specifically developed measurement tool using the Chinese validation has a great limitation. The validity of tool in this study need to further test. The choice to measure psychological stress, sleep quality and subjective health with one or two items weakens the assessment and shortens the validity of the measure tools. Fifth, a convenient sample was used in our study, which is very small compared to the Chinese doctors population. Moreover, due to the online survey for collecting data, the quality of the questionnaires not be monitored. Therefore, a rigorous sampling technique and a larger samples are needed in future research. The samples in this study were large; however, these doctors were a small number of Chinese doctors. Moreover, considering of the sampling characteristics, the results of the study are not generalisable to all Chinese doctors.\n\nConclusions The findings indicate that 83.4% of participants reported that they had suffered more than one type of WPV. Exposure to WPV towards Chinese doctors is common. All the seven styles of WPV were found among Chinese doctors. The incidence rate of violence from high to low are verbal abuse, made difficulties, smear reputation, mobbing behaviour, menace behaviour, physical violence and sexual harassment. This study also demonstrated that WPV was associated with psychological stress, sleep quality and subjective health. Finally, this study made a new discovery regarding a rarely mentioned variable in the previous literature; psychological stress played a mediating role in the relationship between exposure to violence and health damage.", "image": "http://bmjopen.bmj.com/", "subject": "stress"}, "fa5a2bac5ca7c7d7d4170c956438e56b": {"title": "Human interaction causes alarming stress in narwhals, the &#39;unicorns of the sea&#39;", "summary": "Narwhals, nicknamed the \u201cunicorns of the sea\u201d because of their signature head tusks, exhibit an \u201calarming\u201d response to human-caused stress that may lead to brain damage, researchers said Thursday.

Plants must adjust their developmental and physiological processes to cope with salt stress. Although the capacity for adaptation ultimately depends on the genome, the exceptional versatility in gene regulation provided by the spliceosome-mediated alternative splicing (AS) is essential in these adaptive processes. However, the functions of the spliceosome in plant stress responses are poorly understood. Here, we report the in-depth characterization of a U1 spliceosomal protein, AtU1A, in controlling AS of pre-mRNAs under salt stress and salt stress tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana. The atu1a mutant was hypersensitive to salt stress and accumulated more reactive oxygen species (ROS) than the wild-type under salt stress. RNA-seq analysis revealed that AtU1A regulates AS of many genes, presumably through modulating recognition of 5\u2032 splice sites. We showed that AtU1A is associated with the pre-mRNA of the ROS detoxification-related gene ACO1 and is necessary for the regulation of ACO1 AS. ACO1 is important for salt tolerance because ectopic expression of ACO1 in the atu1a mutant can partially rescue its salt hypersensitive phenotype. Our findings highlight the critical role of AtU1A as a regulator of pre-mRNA processing and salt tolerance in plants.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nGiven the sessile nature of plants, their survival under adverse environmental conditions requires that they rapidly perceive environmental cues and convert the cues into adaptive metabolic and developmental changes (1\u20133). One such environmental cue, high soil salinity, greatly limits plant growth and development and the quality and productivity of agricultural crops worldwide. Understanding how plants perceive and respond to salt stress is critical for improving plant resistance to salt stress through rational breeding and genetic engineering strategies.\n\nHigh levels of salts including chlorides of sodium, calcium and magnesium cause soil sodicity, alkalinity and other soil problems (4). High soil salinity harms plants because of the toxicity of Na+ and other ions. To deal with high salinity, plant cells have evolved mechanisms to regulate ion influx and efflux at the plasma membrane and to sequester salts in vacuoles in order to maintain ion homeostasis in the cell (2). Salinity and many other stresses also cause plants to accumulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) including superoxide (O 2 .\u2212) and hydroxyl (OH.) free radicals, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) and free singlet oxygen (5,6). To maintain redox homeostasis, plants have developed enzymatic strategies (involving superoxide dismutase, peroxidase and catalase) and non-enzymatic strategies (involving antioxidants and some secondary metabolites) to detoxify excessive ROS (5). In addition to induce these cellular responses, salt stress can induce the expression of many stress-responsive genes, including those encoding transcription factors and protein kinases (7,8). Most studies on stress-regulated gene expression in plants have focused on the regulation of gene expression at the transcriptional level; in comparison, the regulation of salt-induced gene expression at the post-transcriptional level is much less known (9).\n\nPost-transcriptional regulation of gene expression includes pre-mRNA splicing, capping and polyadenylation, mRNA transport, mRNA stability and translation of the functional mRNA (10), although some of these processes occur co-transcriptionally. Among these processes, pre-mRNA splicing, which is an essential step between transcription and translation of most eukaryotic mRNAs, is mediated by a dynamic macromolecular complex termed the spliceosome (11,12). The major spliceosome consists of five small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs), namely U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6, and hundreds of non-snRNP proteins, which include serine- and arginine-rich proteins (SR proteins). Genome-wide studies have demonstrated that some of these spliceosome components are involved in responses to various abiotic stresses, including high soil salinity, temperature stress and high light irradiation (13\u201317). Overexpression of certain spliceosome or other splicing factors can increase plant tolerance to salt and other stresses (14,18). Thus, accurate and efficient regulation of these spliceosome components is necessary for gene function and may increase plant adaption to salt and other stresses (19).\n\nIn the present study, we characterize a novel mutant with reduced salt stress tolerance and show that the mutation disrupts the function of a gene encoding the Arabidopsis U1 snRNP-specific protein (AtU1A). Our study reveals that AtU1A is a component of a spliceosome complex in Arabidopsis and plays a pivotal role in pre-mRNA splicing of the oxidative stress-related gene ACO1 through direct pre-mRNA binding. The atu1a mutation alters genome-wide splicing patterns, especially in response to salt stress. Overexpression of AtU1A in Arabidopsis increases salt tolerance and the expression of many stress-related genes. Our study reveals a critical role for the AtU1A spliceosomal protein in regulating alternative splicing (AS) and in determining salt tolerance.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nPlant materials and growth conditions\n\nArabidopsis thaliana seedlings on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium agar plates ($$\\frac{1}{2}$$ MS salts, 2% sucrose, 1.2% agar, pH 5.7) were routinely grown under continuous white light (\u223c75 \u03bcmol m\u22122 s\u22121) at 23 \u00b1 1\u00b0C. Soil-grown plants were grown at 23 \u00b1 1\u00b0C with a 16-h-light/8-h-dark photoperiod. Seeds of the T-DNA insertion line of AtU1A (SALK_074230) and other homozygous T-DNA mutants described in this study were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center at the Ohio State University (Columbus, OH, USA).\n\nPhysiological assays\n\nFor a seed germination assay, seeds of Col-0 and the atu1a mutant were sown horizontally on a half-strength MS medium with or without NaCl. In each experiment, at least 100 seeds per genotype were stratified at 4\u00b0C for 3 days, and radicle emergence was used as an indication of seed germination.\n\nFor a salt sensitivity assay on plates, Col-0, the atu1a mutant, and the atu1a complementation lines (U1A pro :U1A in atu1a #1 to #4) were grown vertically on MS medium with 1.2% agar under continuous light for 4 days at 23\u00b0C. Seedlings were transferred to MS medium with or without NaCl. Seedlings were photographed and fresh weights were measured at the indicated times.\n\nFor a salt sensitivity assay in soil, Col-0, atu1a and the AtU1A overexpression lines (OX1 and OX2) were grown in soil under a long-day photoperiod (16 h light/8 h dark) for 2 weeks. Subsequently, the soil was irrigated with 300 mM NaCl every 2 day, and plants were allowed to grow for an additional 1 to 3 weeks before they were photographed and chlorophyll content was analyzed.\n\nFor an oxidative stress assay on plates, Col-0 and atu1a mutants were grown vertically on MS medium with 1.2% agar under continuous light for 4 days at 23\u00b0C. Seedlings were transferred to MS medium with or without oxidative reagent (methyl viologen [MV) or H 2 O 2 ). Seedlings were photographed and fresh weights were measured 14 days after the transfer.\n\nFor a chlorophyll content analysis, the leaves of soil-grown Col-0 and atu1a mutant seedlings were harvested, weighed and placed in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. The leaves were ground with steel beads and extracted with 80% acetone. After they were incubated in the dark for 2 h at room temperature, the samples were centrifuged at 16 000 \u00d7 g for 10 min and the supernatants were transferred to new tubes. Absorption at 645 and 663 nm was determined with a spectrophotometer. The concentration of chlorophyll was calculated as previously described (20).\n\nPlasmid construction for gene complementation\n\nTo conduct a gene complementation of the atu1a mutant, we amplified a 3623-bp fragment of the AtU1A genomic sequence with the U1Apro attB1 and U1Ag attB2 primers (Supplementary Table S3) and cloned the fragment into the pDONR207 vector by BP recombination reaction (Gateway Cloning, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The resulting entry clone (pDONR207-AtU1Ag) was then introduced into the Gateway destination vector pGWB501 to yield the complementation clone by LR recombination reaction (Gateway Cloning, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The pGWB501-AtU1A genomic construct was introduced into the atu1a mutant through Agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation (21). T 3 transgenic lines were confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and were used for salt sensitivity assays.\n\nqRT-PCR and RT-PCR analyses\n\nWe used Trizol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to extract total RNA from 12-day-old seedlings grown on MS medium under a 16-h-light/8-h-dark photoperiod. Total RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase I to remove potential genomic DNA contaminations. A 5-\u03bcg quantity of RNA was used for reverse transcription with M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The synthesized cDNA mixture was used as a template for quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) or RT-PCR analysis with the primers listed in Supplementary Table S3. UBQ10 was used as an internal control.\n\nAnalysis of AtU1A subcellular localization and AtU1A promoter activity\n\nFor subcellular localization, the AtU1A coding region or AtU1A genomic sequence without the stop codon was amplified and then cloned into the pDONR207 vector by BP recombination reaction. The resulting entry vector was then recombined with the destination vector pGWB505 or pGWB504 through LR recombination reaction to fuse the target protein to the N terminus of green fluorescent protein (GFP). For a promoter \u03b2-glucuronidase (GUS) assay, a 1895-bp genomic sequence 5\u2032-upstream of the gene was amplified and then cloned into the pDONR207 vector by BP recombination reaction. The resulting entry vector was then recombined with the destination vector pGWB533 by LR recombination reaction. The constructs were transformed into Col-0 or the atu1a mutant, and transgenic T 3 lines or T 2 lines were used for GFP observation or GUS staining, respectively.\n\nYeast two- or three-hybrid assays\n\nTo create the AtU1A bait plasmid, we cloned the AtU1A cDNA into the pGBKT7 vector. Yeast transformation was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech, CA, USA). To detect the interaction between AtU1A and other spliceosome protein (AtU1-70K and AtU1C), we amplified Arabidopsis U1-70K and U1C cDNAs from Col-0 plants and cloned them into the pDONR207 vector by BP recombination reaction. The entry vector pDONR207-AtU1A, pDONR207-AtU1-70K CDS and pDONR207-AtU1C CDS were recombined into the destination vector pGADT7 by LR recombination reactions to yield the yeast expression constructs. These constructs were then co-transformed into yeast stain Y2H gold with the corresponding full-length partner (AtU1A in pGBKT7) and were plated on -tryptophan/-leucine (-TL, for transformation control) and \u2013leucine/-tryptophan/-histidine (-L-T-H, for selection) media. To detect the interaction between AtU1A and pre-mRNA (U1 snRNA and ACO1 5S), we cloned the Arabidopsis pre-mRNAs of U1 snRNA and ACO1 5S into the plllA/MS2-2 vector. These constructs were then co-transformed into the yeast strain L40-coat and plated on media that that contained 2 mM 3-aminotriazole but lacked leucine and uracil. The empty plllA/MS2-2 vector and pAD-AtU1A plasmid were co-transformed into the yeast strain L40-coat and used as negative controls. To detect the interaction between AtU1 snRNA and U2B'', we cloned the Arabidopsis U2B'' into the pGAD vector. The plllA-AtU1 snRNA and pAD-AtU2B'' plasmids were then co-transformed into the yeast strain L40-coat and plated on media that contained 2 mM 3-aminotriazole but lacked leucine and uracil. The empty pGAD vector and plllA-AtU1 snRNA were co-transformed into the yeast strain L40-coat and used as negative controls. The plllA/IRE-MS2 vector and pAD-IRP plasmid were co-transformed into the yeast strain L40-coat and used as positive controls.\n\nBimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays in N. benthamiana\n\nThe entry vectors pDONR207-AtU1A CDS, pDONR207-AtU1-70K CDS and pDONR207-AtU1C CDS were recombined into the destination vector pEarlygate201YN or pEarlygate202YC by LR recombination reaction to yield the corresponding expression constructs. The resulting constructs were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101, and the transformed Agrobacteria were grown overnight at 28\u00b0C in LB medium. After they were harvested by centrifugation, the bacteria were re-suspended and incubated in induction medium (10 mM MES, pH 5.6, 10 mM MgCl 2 and 150 \u03bcM acetosyringone; Sigma) for 2 h. The bacteria were then resuspended in the induction medium to a final concentration of OD 600 = 0.5 before inoculation. The bacterial suspensions were infiltrated into young but fully expanded Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. After infiltration, plants were immediately covered with plastic bags and kept at 23\u00b0C for 48\u201372 h before they were examined with confocal microscopy.\n\nPoly-A RNA in situ hybridization\n\nPoly-A RNA in situ hybridization was performed as described before with minor modifications (22). In brief, 7-day-old seedlings grown in MS plates treated or not treated with salt (150 mM NaCl for 3 h) were immersed in 10 ml of fixation cocktail containing a mixture of 50% fixation buffer (120 mM NaCl, 7 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 3 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 2.7 mM KCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 80 mM EGTA, 5% formaldehyde and 10% Dimethyl Sulphoxide (DMSO)) and 50% heptane. The samples were gently agitated for 30 min at room temperature. After dehydration twice for 5 min each time in 100% methanol and three times for 5 min each time in 100% ethanol, the samples were incubated for 30 min in ethanol:xylene (50:50). After they were washed twice for 5 min each time in 100% ethanol and twice for 5 min each time in 100% methanol, the samples were first incubated for 5 min each time in methanol:fixation buffer without formaldehyde (50:50) before they were incubated for 30 min in fixation buffer with formaldehyde. After being rinsed twice for 5 min each time with fixation buffer without formaldehyde and once for 5 min with 1 ml of PerfectHyb Plus Hybridization Buffer (Sigma-Aldrich; H-7033), the samples were treated with 1 ml of the PerfectHyb Plus Hybridization Buffer and were pre-hybridized for 1 h at 50\u00b0C. After pre-hybridization, 5 pmol of 5\u2032-labeled (Alex-488; Invitrogen) oligo d(T) was added and the samples were hybridized overnight at 50\u00b0C in darkness. The samples were then washed once for 60 min in 2 \u00d7 Saline Sodium Citrate (SSC) (1 \u00d7 SSC is 0.15 M NaCl and 0.015 M sodium citrate), and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) at 50\u00b0C and once for 20 min in 0.2 \u00d7 SSC, and 0.1% SDS at 50\u00b0C in darkness. The samples were then immediately examined using a Leica confocal laser-scanning microscope with a 488-nm excitation laser. Each experiment was repeated at least three times, and similar results were obtained.\n\nRNA immunoprecipitation assays\n\nA 3-g quantity of fresh leaves per sample from seedlings at the rosette stage was harvested, and incubated in 1% formaldehyde in vacuum for 15 min to crosslink protein\u2013RNA. The crosslinking was stopped by adding 125 mM glycine and incubating for 5 min. Leaves were ground and resuspended in lysis buffer (100 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 10% glycerol, 0.1% NP-40, 200 U/ml RNasin, 2 mM Ribonucleoside Vanadyl Complexes, 2 mM Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 10 \u03bcl/ml protease inhibitor [PI, Sigma P9599]). The lysed supernatant was sonicated to produce fragments of 300\u2013500 bp, which were then treated with DNase to remove DNA before immunoprecipitation. RNA-IP was then performed using anti-GFP antibody (catalog number ab290, Abcam) coupled with Dynabeads Protein G (catalog number 10003D, Invitrogen). After the preparation was washed five times, the protein on the crosslinked complex was digested by proteinase K, and the RNA was extracted with phenol\u2013chloroform\u2013isoamyl alcohol. Following reverse transcription, qRT-PCR was performed with the UBC30 gene as an internal control.\n\nRNA-seq analysis and validation\n\nThe 12-day-old seedlings of Col-0 and the atu1a mutant grown on MS medium were transferred to MS medium containing 0 or 150 mM NaCl and allowed to grow for an additional 3 h. Total RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) from these above seedlings and was treated with Turbo RNase-free DNase I (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to remove genomic DNA. Polyadenylated RNAs were isolated using the Oligotex mRNA Midi Kit (70042, Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA, USA). The RNA-seq libraries generated from Col-0 and the atu1a mutant plants under normal and salt stress condition (there are two biological replicates per genotype) were constructed using the Illumina Whole Transcriptome Analysis Kit following the standard protocol (Illumina, HiSeq system) and were sequenced on the HiSeq 2000 platform to generate high-quality pair-end reads of 101 nt. To identify differential AS events corresponding to all five basic types of AS patterns (23), we subjected the RNA-seq data to analysis by rMATS v3.2.5 (http://rnaseq-mats.sourceforge.net). Statistical parameters for significant splicing change were defined as FDR < 0.05 and P-value < 0.05. The selected AS and intron retention (IR) events were validated by RT-PCR using a set of primers (See Supplementary Table S3) that were designed based on each AS event. The sequencing data of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) experiments are available in the SRA database (Accession number: SRS1498194).\n\nNucleotide frequencies around novel and known splicing sites were determined and visually displayed using sequence logos (24).\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe atu1a mutant is hypersensitive to salt stress\n\nWe previously reported a genome-wide analysis of AS of pre-mRNAs under salt stress in Arabidopsis (15). Further studies suggested that AS in plants might be involved in the regulation of salt tolerance (14,25). To find new components of AS pathways involved in salt stress responses, we performed a genetic screen with our collection of homozygous Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion mutants. From this analysis, we isolated a mutant, atu1a, with reduced salt tolerance (Figure 1). When 4-day-old wild-type (ecotype Col-0) and atu1a seedlings were transferred to MS medium containing 125 mM NaCl, the growth of the primary root and shoot was mildly reduced for wild-type seedlings, but was greatly reduced for atu1a seedlings (Figure 1A and B). When seedlings were grown on 175 mM NaCl, most of the atu1a mutant seedlings died while the wild-type seedlings remained green (Figure 1A and Supplementary Figure S1A). We further examined the phenotypes of wild-type and the atu1a mutant during seed germination and cotyledon greening under salt stress. In the absence of salt stress, germination rates did not significantly differ between the wild-type and the atu1a mutant (Supplementary Figure S1C). Although germination of both atu1a mutant and wild-type seeds was delayed under salt stress, the germination rate of the atu1a mutant seeds was substantially lower (Supplementary Figure S1C). Furthermore, inhibition of cotyledon greening by salt was greater in the atu1a mutant than in the wild-type (Supplementary Figure S1D). We then determined the salt tolerance of soil-grown plants. When treated with 300 mM NaCl for 2 weeks, about 60% of atu1a mutant plants died while only 20% of wild-type plants died (Figure 1D and E). Chlorophyll content of salt-stressed plants was also lower for the atu1a mutant than for the wild-type (Figure 1F), which was consistent with the increased salt damage in the mutant. To determine whether the salt-sensitive phenotype of the atu1a mutant is specific to Na+, we transferred 4-day-old atu1a mutant plants to MS medium containing different concentrations of LiCl, KCl or sorbitol. We found that atu1a mutant plants were more sensitive than wild-type plants to LiCl but not to KCl (Supplementary Figure S1A and B). However, the response of atu1a mutant plants to sorbitol, which induces general osmotic stress, was similar to that of wild-type plants (Supplementary Figure S1A and B). Thus, the atu1a mutant is specifically sensitive to Na+ and Li+, but not to K+ or Cl\u2212.\n\nFigure 1. View largeDownload slide Salt-hypersensitive phenotype of the atu1a mutant.

RT-PCR analysis revealed that AtU1A expression is abolished in the atu1a mutant (Figure 2A and B). The AtU1A protein, one of the U1 snRNP-specific proteins, contains two evolutionarily conserved RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) involved in the biosynthesis of cellular RNA (26). The human N-terminal RRM (amino acids [aa] 2\u201395) of U1A is necessary and sufficient for binding to the stem-loop2 sequence of U1 snRNA, while the C-terminal RRM (aa 202\u2013283) of the human U1A does not seem to have any affinity for RNA (27\u201329). To further test whether shorter AtU1A transcripts are still present in the mutant as T-DNA insertion site was located in the bridge between two domains of RRMs of AtU1A (Figure 2A). The AtU1A transcript is severely disrupted in the mutant when N-terminal primers are used (F1 + R1, Figure 2A and B), and is abolished in the mutant when C-terminal primers are used (F2 + R2, Figure 2A and B).\n\nFigure 2.

Error bars represent SD (n = 3 in [C] and [F]).\n\nTo confirm that the T-DNA insertion in AtU1A was responsible for the salt stress sensitive phenotype of the atu1a mutant, we transformed a genomic DNA fragment containing the entire AtU1A gene (with a \u223c1.9-kb promoter region, the AtU1A coding region, and 185-bp fragment downstream of the translation stop codon) into the atu1a mutant. Thirty-two independent transgenic lines were obtained, and four T 3 lines were randomly chosen to test for salt stress sensitivity. The mutant seedlings remained sensitive to salt stress, but the four transgenic lines did not (Supplementary Figure S3). These data demonstrated that the T-DNA insertion mutation in AtU1A is responsible for the atu1a mutant phenotypes.\n\nExpression pattern of AtU1A and subcellular localization of AtU1A\n\nTo further determine the function of AtU1A in planta, we investigated its expression patterns. AtU1A is expressed at a relatively high level throughout the plant life cycle as revealed by publicly available gene expression data (Figure 2C) (30). In addition, GUS activity with transgenic plants harboring AtU1A promoter-driven GUS (AtU1A pro ::GUS) and RT-PCR analyses confirmed AtU1A expression profiles in different plant tissues (Figure 2D and E). We then examined the expression of AtU1A in response to salt stress or abscisic acid (ABA). Total RNA was extracted from wild-type seedlings treated with 150 mM NaCl or 50 \u03bcM ABA for various periods of time. We found that the transcript levels of AtU1A were up-regulated by salt or ABA (Figure 2F). Consistent with the qRT-PCR results, transgenic plants harboring AtU1A promoter-driven GUS showed a slight upregulation in GUS activity in response to salt stress (Figure 2F). To determine the subcellular localization of AtU1A in vivo, we transiently expressed AtU1A fused in frame with the GFP at the C-terminus (AtU1A-GFP) in Arabidopsis protoplasts. Consistent with observations from a previous study (31), the AtU1A protein was localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm in Arabidopsis protoplasts (Supplementary Figure S2C). We next obtained several independent transgenic plants that stably express AtU1A-GFP. The AtU1A-GFP signals in these plants were mainly detected in the nuclei of root cells, and only very weak signals were detected in the cytoplasm (Figure 2H).\n\nAtU1A is a U1 snRNP-specific protein in planta\n\nMolecular phylogenetic analysis of AtU1A and its plant and animal orthologs by the maximum likelihood method revealed that AtU1A is closely related to the human U1A and that its orthologs in other plant species are present (Supplementary Figure S4A). It is well documented that the human U1 snRNP complex comprises of three U1-specific proteins (U1A, U1-70K and U1C) and seven \u2018Smith antigen\u2019 (Sm) proteins (Sm B/B\u2019, Sm C, Sm D1, Sm D2, Sm D3, Sm F and Sm G), and is required for spliceosome assembly, pre-mRNA splicing and AS by precisely recognizing the 5\u2032 splice sites (32). To determine whether AtU1A in this study is a U1 snRNP-specific protein in planta, we performed a yeast two-hybrid assay. Interestingly, AtU1A interacted with both AtU1-70K and AtU1C in yeast (Figure 3A). To confirm whether these interactions occur in vivo, we performed bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays in tobacco leaves by Agrobacterium infiltration. Consistent with the yeast two-hybrid results, AtU1A interacted with both AtU1-70K and AtU1C in vivo (Figure 3B). These results indicate that AtU1A is coupled with AtU1-70K and AtU1C and that these three proteins form a stable sub-complex of the U1 snRNP in planta. The AtU1A protein plays a critical role in the identification of 5\u2032 splice site by the U1 snRNP through base-paring interactions of the U1 snRNA. We therefore performed RNA-IP analysis to determine whether AtU1A can directly bind to U1 snRNA in Arabidopsis. We took advantage of the AtU1A pro :U1A-GFP transgenic line in the atu1a mutant and applied antibody against GFP to immunoprecipitate AtU1A-GFP. We found that AtU1A could directly bind to U1 snRNA in vivo (Figure 3C). Researchers previously reported that the U1A protein is able to autoregulate its own production by binding to and inhibiting the polyadenylation of its own pre-mRNA in vertebrates (33). The 3\u2032 untranslated region of U1A pre-mRNA contains a 50-nt polyadenylation-inhibitory element RNA that is required for the cooperative binding between two molecules of U1A protein (34). Further study demonstrated that 14 residues of the U1A protein are necessary for homodimerization, RNA binding and inhibition of polyadenylation (35). To determine whether AtU1A protein can dimerize, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to detect protein\u2013protein interaction. Unexpectedly, the AtU1A protein did not homodimerize in yeast, i.e. the affinity between two molecules of the protein was not greater than the affinity for one molecule of the protein with the empty vector (Figure 3D). We confirmed that AtU1A does not homodimerize in vivo with a BiFC assay (Figure 3B). Because two molecules of AtU1A protein do not homodimerize, we reasoned that the plant AtU1Amight not have an additional role in determining the polyadenylation. The RNA-IP analysis showed that AtU1A cannot bind to its own pre-mRNA located in 3\u2032 untranslated region (Figure 3C). This observation is consistent with a previous study that found that the AtU1A proteins do not bind to their own RNAs in vitro (36).\n\nFigure 3.

Asterisks indicate significant differences (***P < 0.001) as determined by a two-tailed paired Student's t-test.\n\nIn addition to the U1 snRNA and the common Sm proteins, the human (and most likely the plant) U1 snRNP complex contains three specific proteins: U1-70K, U1 and U1C. We then determined whether transcript levels of other Arabidopsis U1 snRNP proteins as well as AtU1 snRNA were changed in the atu1a mutant. Compared with transcript levels in wild-type plants, the transcript levels of AtU1-70K and AtU1C were not changed in the atu1a mutant under normal or salt stress conditions. However, the transcript level of AtU1 snRNA was significantly reduced in the atu1a mutant under salt stress but not under normal growth conditions (Supplementary Figure S4B).\n\nMutation of AtU1A leads to genome-wide splicing defects under salt stress\n\nU1 snRNPs play an essential role in defining the 5\u2032 splicing site through base-paring interactions of the 5\u2032 end of the U1 snRNA in eukaryotes. To determine the role of AtU1A in pre-mRNA splicing, we first performed RNA-seq using the Illumina Hi-seq platform in order to examine the global defects in pre-mRNA splicing in the atu1a mutant. We detected aberrant splicing events in only 215 unique genes in the atu1a mutant plants under normal growth conditions (Figure 4A). Our previous studies showed that splicing defects could be enhanced by salt stress in the hos5 (25) or sad1/lsm5 mutant (14). We therefore determined whether salt stress affects pre-mRNA splicing in the atu1a mutant. We generated 65.59 and 52.59 million reads with an average length of 101 bp from the wild-type and atu1a, respectively. Almost 90% of these reads could be unambiguously aligned to the TAIR10 reference genome sequence (fragments per kilo base of exons per million mapped reads- [FPKM] > 0.85). Comparison of the mapped reads against the gene mode (version TAIR10) revealed that \u223c95% of the reads were mapped to the exon regions, whereas only \u223c3% were mapped to the intergenic regions. Plotting the coverage of reads along each transcribed unit revealed a uniform distribution, with no obvious 3\u2032/5\u2032 bias, which indicates that the cDNA library was of high quality. Interestingly, we detected aberrant splicing events in 705 unique genes in the atu1a mutant under salt stress (Figure 4A). These splicing events belong to five categories: IR, alternative 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 splice site (5S or 3S), exon skipping (ES) and mutually exclusive exon (Figure 4B; Supplementary Tables S1 and 2). Previous studies showed that U1 snRNP-specific proteins are required for 5\u2032 splice site recognitions, and consensus sequences at the 5S are important for accurate splicing of pre-mRNAs in plants (10,37). Our previous studies revealed that the majority of splice sites are conformed to consensus sequences under salt stress (14,15). In the current study, however, the frequency distribution of the nucleotides at 5S from the aberrant splicing events in the atu1a mutant differed from these consensus sequences, with an obvious decrease in the frequency distribution of the base G at +1 positions of the alternative 5\u2032 splice sites (Figure 4C). This suggests that, as is the case in other eukaryotes, the AtU1A protein in Arabidopsis functions in alternative 5\u2032 splice site recognition (37,38).\n\nFigure 4.

These events are highlighted by asterisks.\n\nTo validate the differential AS data revealed in the RNA-seq experiments, we selected and assessed representative splicing events of IR, 5S and ES by using RT-PCR analysis with primers flanking these events in the salt-treated atu1a mutant. We found that the aberrant splicing events were readily detected in the salt-treated atu1a mutant, whereas they were not detected or only weakly detected in the wild-type plants (Figure 4E and F; Supplementary Figure S5). When we attempted to detect above selected aberrant splicing events under normal growth conditions, no obvious difference was evident between the wild-type and the atu1a mutant plants (Supplementary Figure S6). These results indicate that AtU1A is mainly involved in pre-mRNA splicing in the presence of but not in the absence of salt stress.\n\nGene ontology analysis of the genes with aberrant 5\u2032 splice site recognition in the atu1a mutant revealed a striking enrichment in the response-to-abiotic-stress categories (Supplementary Figure S7A). We also analyzed these genes with Genevestigator and found that they are closely associated with the response to salt stress (Supplementary Figure S7B). These results suggest that AtU1A plays critical roles in regulating splicing of stress-responsive genes under salt stress.\n\nMutation of AtU1A impairs mRNA export under salt stress\n\nIn view of the connections between splicing and mRNA export, we examined mRNA accumulation in the nuclei of the atu1a mutant. Leaf samples from seedlings with or without NaCl treatment were fixed by formaldehyde and hybridized with an oligo(dT) probe labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 (polyA RNA). In agreement with the differential AS results in the atu1a mutant, Fluor 488 signal strength did not significantly differ between the wild-type and the atu1a mutant under normal growth conditions. However, accumulation of polyA RNA was increased in the wild-type and atu1a mutant under salt stress, and the accumulation was greater in the atu1a mutant (Figure 5). The defective mRNA export phenotypes of hos5 versus C24 (background of the hos5 mutant) in the presence and absence of salt stress indicated that our experimental conditions were similar to those reported previously (25). Together, these data suggest that AtU1A is involved in mRNA export under salt stress.\n\nFigure 5. View largeDownload slide Impairment of mRNA export in the atu1a mutant under salt stress.

PolyA in situ hybridization analysis was performed and polyA signals were detected with a confocal microscope.\n\nThe atu1a mutant over-accumulates ROS under salt stress\n\nSalt stress can cause over-production of ROS and thereby affects salt stress tolerance in plants. We determined whether the increased salt sensitivity of the atu1a mutant is due to over-accumulation of ROS. The fluorescent dye 5-(and 6)-chloromethyl-2\u20327\u2032-dichlorodihydrofluo resceindiacetate acetyl ester (CM-H 2 DCFDA) was used to visualize and quantify total ROS in the roots. Under normal growth conditions, ROS fluorescence signals did not significantly differ in the atu1a mutant versus the wild-type (Figure 6A). In response to 150 mM NaCl, however, ROS levels were higher in the atu1a mutant plants than the wild-type plants and the ROS levels also remained high for a longer period in the mutant than in the wild-type plants (Figure 6A). These results suggested that the increased salt sensitivity in the atu1a mutant might be caused by over-accumulation of ROS. We further tested the sensitivity of atu1a mutants to two exogenous chemicals, H 2 O 2 or MV, that can lead to an increase in the generation of toxic superoxide free radicals in plants. We found that primary root growth was more sensitive to H 2 O 2 (1 mM) or MV (0.2 \u03bcM) for of the atu1a mutant than for the wild-type (Supplementary Figure S8A and B).\n\nFigure 6.

Notably, we found that the CSD1 gene in the atu1a mutant has an IR event and that the ACO1 gene in the atu1a mutant has two types of splicing defects including IR and alternative 5\u2032 splice selection (Figure 6B and Supplementary Figure S9A). CSD1 encodes a cytosolic copper/zinc superoxide dismutase that can detoxify superoxide radicals (40). ACO1 encodes an aconitase that can catalyze the conversion of citrate to isocitrate through a cis-aconitate intermediate and possibly functions in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. ACO1 protein can specifically bind to the 5\u2032-UTR of CSD2 (it encodes a cytosolic copper/zinc superoxide dismutase that can detoxify superoxide radicals) transcript and affect CSD2 transcript level, and thus it may contribute to the response to oxidative stress (41). To determine whether these ROS detoxification-related enzymes encoding genes are critical for the salt stress-sensitivity phenotype of the atu1a mutant, we generated transgenic plants that overexpress ACO1 (ACO1 OX) or CSD1 (CSD1 OX) in the atu1a mutant background (Figure 6C; Supplementary Figure S9B and C). We found that overexpression of ACO1 in the atu1a mutant could partially restore the salt sensitive phenotype of the atu1a mutant (Figure 6C and Supplementary Figure S9E), while overexpression of CSD1 in atu1a only slightly rescued its salt-sensitive phenotype (Supplementary Figure S9B and C). These results indicate that in addition to ACO1 and CSD1, aberrant splicing patterns in other AtU1A target genes are contributing to the increased salt sensitivity of the atu1a mutant. Because splicing of pre-mRNAs requires recruitment of pre-mRNAs to the spliceosome, we determined whether the pre-mRNAs of CSD1 or ACO1 associate with AtU1A in planta. ACO1 pre-mRNAs, but not the pre-mRNAs of CSD1, were detected in the immunoprecipitation samples from the AtU1A pro :AtU1A-GFP transgenic line (Figure 6D and Supplementary Figure S9D). To clarify the function of AtU1A acting in isolation or as a part of a U1 snRNP complex, we used a yeast three-hybrid system in order to detect RNA\u2013protein interactions in vitro (42). We found that AtU1A protein can bind to the AtU1 snRNA but not to the 5\u2032S of ACO1 pre-mRNA in yeast (Figure 6E). The results support a role for the AtU1A-containing spliceosome in recognizing the 5S of intron in planta. These results also suggest that AtU1A uses more than one pathways to control salt-responsive splicing. Previous study found that U1A and U2B'' are functionally redundant in worms (43). To clarify whether the plant orthologs of U1A and U2B'' are functionally redundant in planta, we carried out additional yeast three-hybrid experiments. Consistent with a previous study (44), we showed that the plant U2B'' cannot bind to the U1 snRNA in vitro suggesting that they may not have redundant function in plant (Supplementary Figure S10). Overall, these results suggest that splicing defects in ROS detoxification-related genes contribute to the overall increased salt-sensitive phenotype of the atu1a plants.\n\nOverexpression of AtU1A increases plant salt tolerance\n\nBecause AtU1A is required for salt stress tolerance and salt stress-responsive gene expression, we generated Arabidopsis transgenic plants expressing AtU1A under the control of the 35S promoter to investigate whether overexpression of AtU1A could improve plant performance under salt stress (Figure 7A). We examined the phenotypes of these AtU1A overexpression lines during seed germination and cotyledon greening under salt stress. Under normal growth conditions, seed germination rates of the wild-type and AtU1A overexpression lines did not significantly differ. Under salt stress, however, seed germination rates were higher for AtU1A overexpression lines for the wild-type (Figure 7B). Furthermore, cotyledon greening was less inhibited by salt stress for the seedlings of AtU1A overexpression lines than for the wild-type seedlings (Figure 7B). On MS medium, shoot and root growth were less inhibited by salt stress for the AtU1A-overexpressing plants than for the wild-type plants (Figures 7C and D). To determine salt tolerance in soil, we treated 2-week-old soil-grown plants with 300 mM NaCl for additional 14 days. Although the salt stress treatment reduced the survival of both kinds of plants, survival was much higher for the AtU1A overexpression plants than for the wild-type plants (Figure 7C and E). To determine whether transcript levels of genes related to salt or oxidative stress were changed by overexpression of AtU1A, we used qRT-PCR to quantify the expression of CSD1, CSD2, COR15, RD22, KIN1 and RD29A. We found that the transcript levels of these stress-related genes were moderately higher in the AtU1A overexpression lines than in the wild-type plants under salt stress (Figure 7F). Taken together, these results indicate that overexpression of AtU1A can increase plant tolerance to salt stress.\n\nFigure 7. View largeDownload slide Overexpression of AtU1A confers salt tolerance.

Previous studies showed that U1A primarily functions as a component of the U1 snRNP complex, which is required for splicing of pre-mRNAs in mammals and yeast (26,31). Our study also revealed that AtU1A is one of the U1 snRNP-specific proteins in Arabidopsis that is closely associated with other two U1 snRNP-specific particles, AtU1-70K and AtU1C. Mutation of AtU1A led to a defect in the AS of a portion of pre-mRNAs encoded by the Arabidopsis genome, and this defect in splicing of pre-mRNAs was much more abundant under salt stress than under normal growth conditions. In response to salt stress, the atu1a mutant accumulated more ROS than the wild-type suggesting that AtU1A is required for suppress ROS levels. We found that AtU1A is required for salt tolerance because it regulates the splicing of pre-mRNAs of ROS-related genes (ACO1 and CSD1) in Arabidopsis. The AtU1A is able to binding to the pre-mRNA of ACO1 through the U1 snRNA but this binding is not evident for the pre-mRNA of CSD1. The importance of AtU1A protein in salt stress responses was supported by the increased salt tolerance of AtU1A overexpression lines in Arabidopsis.\n\nSplicing of pre-mRNAs is a key step in the regulation of gene expression, transcriptome plasticity and proteome diversity in eukaryotes (45,46). Splicing of introns requires the recognition and subsequent cleavage at the 5\u2032 donor and 3\u2032 acceptor sites in genes as mediated by the spliceosome (11,47). The spliceosome consists of five snRNPs and over 200 additional proteins (39). The core particles of the U1, U2, U4 and U5 snRNPs are formed by Sm proteins, whereas the U6 snRNP contains the related LSM2 to LSM8 proteins. The U1 snRNP particles are involved in the first step of spliceosome formation, in which it binds to the 5\u2032 splice site of the pre-mRNAs. In addition to the U1 snRNA and the common Sm proteins, the U1 snRNP particles contain three specific proteins: U1-70K, U1A and U1C. U1-70K and U1C strongly rely on each other to ensure correct 5\u2032 splice site recognition because the stable incorporation of U1C into the U1 snRNP requires the presence of U1-70K, and the presence of U1C is necessary for the interaction of U1-70K with SRSF1 (ASD/SF2), which triggers U1 snRNP binding to the 5\u2032 splice site (48). Our study reveals that AtU1A interacts with AtU1-70K and AtU1C suggesting their interdependent role in the formation of the U1 snRNP (Figure 3). As a component of the U1 snRNP, U1A has two functions in the snRNP biogenesis pathway (33,49). First, U1A binds directly to stem-loop 2 of the U1 snRNA and such binding is required for pre-mRNA splicing (26\u201328). Consistent with the previous reports (31,36), we found that AtU1A can directly bind to AtU1 snRNA both in vitro and in vivo (Figures 3D and 6E), and global RNA-seq study revealed a novel role of AtU1A during AS, primarily during 5\u2032 splice site recognition under salt stress (Figure 4). The nucleotide sequences of this novel 5\u2032 splice-site recognition diverge from consensus sequences, indicating that AtU1A defines correct 5\u2032 splice recognition sites of pre-mRNAs in plants (Figure 4C). Moreover, a rare nucleotide C at +1 positions of the alternative 5\u2032 splice sites observed in the atu1a mutant may at least partially explain the differentially spliced transcripts in the mutant plants. A second function of U1A is that it modulates polyadenylation by autoregulating its expression by blocking polyadenylation of its own mRNA in the 3\u2032 untranslated region. Tandem-affinity purification of U1A identified a large collection of pre-mRNA and RNA processing factors, as well as the transcriptional machinery (50\u201353), suggesting a role of U1A in coupling 3\u2032 processing and splicing. However, plant U1A could not bind to its own mRNA (Figure 3D) suggesting that plant U1A is not involved in polyadenylation (36). Thus, it is possible that snRNP-free AtU1A protein does not tightly regulate polyadenylation or that such regulation is achieved by a different mechanism in plants.\n\nBecause regulation of gene expression is important for the adaptation and survival of plants under environment stress conditions, it has been the focus of many previous studies (1,54\u201357). Recent genome-wide studies have revealed that pre-mRNA splicing is affected by development and stress treatment (13,15,58), and that activities of spliceosome-like proteins, such as pre-mRNA splicing as mediated by LSM5 and SKIP, are important for plant stress tolerance (14,59). A defect in the homolog of the LSM5 protein, SAD1/LSM5, leads to an increased sensitivity to drought and ABA (60). The sad1/lsm5 mutant also has reduced levels of U6 snRNA and increased levels of unspliced pre-mRNAs, suggesting that SAD1/LSM5 may contribute to U6 stability in pre-mRNA splicing. Similarly, the lsm4 mutant is hypersensitive to salt and ABA and shows mis-splicing of some stress-related genes (61). The STABILIZED1 (STA1) protein, which is similar to the human U5 small ribonucleoprotein-associated 102-kD protein, is required for the response to cold stress in Arabidopsis (62). A component of the U4/U6 snRNP, RDM16, which encodes a pre-mRNA-splicing factor 3 and is involved in pre-mRNA splicing in planta. Mutation of RDM16 resulted in hypersensitivity to salt stress and ABA, and transcriptome analysis revealed a novel role of RDM16 in the RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway (63). RBM25 is a novel splicing factor that modulates the response to ABA during and after seed germination by recognizing the pre-mRNAs of HAB1 and many other genes (64,65). Mutants defective in the subunits of the cap-binding complex, At-CBP20/80, which interact with the m7G cap of pre-mRNAs, showed splicing defects for genes involved in proline and sugar metabolism (66). Mutation in a spliceosomal protein, PRPF31, reduces tolerance to low temperature. AtPRP31, which regulates the formation of the U4/U6.U5 snRNP, is required for splicing of cold-induced genes, especially under cold stress (67,68).\n\nOur study indicates that AtU1A protein is responsible for recognizing the 5\u2032 splice site in the initial step of pre-mRNA splicing, and that mutation in AtU1A results in defective splicing of many stress-responsive genes. Moreover, overexpression of AtU1A increases plant tolerance to salt stress, indicating that AtU1A and the spliced genes that it regulates are essential for salt tolerance (Figure 8). Database searches revealed that close orthologs of AtU1A are present in many other plant species (Supplementary Figure S4). These findings suggest that the spliceosome complex is conserved across plant species. Perhaps these homologs have functions similar to those of AtU1A in response to salt stress. Because overexpression of AtU1A increases salt tolerance in Arabidopsis, manipulation of AtU1A (or its close orthologs) levels in corps may also increase crop salt tolerance.\n\nFigure 8.

This schematic illustration shows how the 5\u2032 splice site in the Arabidopsis aconitase (ACO1) pre-mRNA can be sequentially recognized by the U1 snRNA that is associated with the U1 snRNP-specific protein AtU1A.

Other genes whose pre-mRNA splicing are under the control of AtU1A may also contribute to salt tolerance.\n\nFigure 8.

But some researchers say evidence remains inconclusive about whether human-animal interaction, or HAI, actually reduces stress.\n\nIn her November 2016 article, \u201cEffects of Interactions With Animals On Human Psychological Distress,\u201d a synthesis of quantitative evidence on the topic, Yale doctoral candidate Molly K. Crossman cited a \u201cmurky body of evidence on the influence of HAI on distress.\u201d Crossman\u2019s paper found varying results, with some studies indicating positive short-term effects, others finding no effect and some observational studies even associating the caring or attachment to a companion or service animal with higher rates of distress.\n\nFor Wendy Taylor-Tanielian, marketing manager of Tony La Russa\u2019s Animal Rescue Foundation, which organizes Pet Hug Pack, a therapy animal team that travels to hospitals, schools and rehabilitation centers across Contra Costa County, the positive effects of these animals are palpable.\n\n\u201cSometimes a smile is the best statistic you can get,\u201d Taylor-Tanielian said. \u201cWe leave the science up to the scientists and we go with our interactions.\u201c\n\nPet Hug Pack, which typically visits the UC Berkeley campus the first Tuesday of every month, traveled to more than 21 high school and college campuses this semester, according to Taylor-Tanielian. They were last on campus Tuesday at Moffitt Library to provide a finals study break for students.\n\n\u201cI think you can actually just witness when our animals are on campus because you can hear the squeals \u2026 and you can just watch people\u2019s faces change,\u201d Taylor-Tanielian said. \u201c(Students) may be going across campus with a stern look and their entire dispositions change.\u201d\n\nAccording to Crossman\u2019s paper, evidence seems to suggest that HAI may have \u201csmall-to-medium\u201d effects on distress. But it\u2019s not clear whether it\u2019s really the animals themselves that account for these effects.\n\nDaniel Shepard, a campus senior and business administration major, called the Pet Hug Pack events \u201csilly,\u201d adding that his recent interaction with the animals had \u201czero\u201d effect on his stress.\n\n\u201cThe only positive effect is that it did give me something to giggle about afterward,\u201d Shepard said. \u201cThe bottom line is that I think there\u2019s too much attention on animals. People are paying attention to the animals to the point that they\u2019re ignoring humans.\u201d\n\nLarkin Bond, a junior transfer and sociology major, called her three dogs her \u201cbest friends\u201d and credited them with helping her deal with the loss of her uncle and her transition to Berkeley.\n\n\u201cThey just love me unconditionally,\u201d Bond said. \u201cAnd if I have the worst day at school they don\u2019t care what grades I get. They love me no matter what.\u201d\n\nContact Jared Brewer at [email protected] and follow him on Twitter at @JaredBBrewer.", "image": "http://i2.wp.com/www.dailycal.org/assets/uploads/2017/12/pets_anaisabeldiaz_file.jpg", "subject": "stress"}, "bbdce0e06d420ab0c0df477326a7feea": {"title": "For Black Professionals, Secondhand Racism Is an Unending Stress", "summary": "\u201cWhen you start to worry about something, whether that&#39;s race or something else, then that initiates a biological stress response,\u201d Berkeley School of Public Health researcher Amani M.

But I wasn\u2019t in any mood to celebrate, because I\u2019d just seen Victor Dempsey crying like a baby.\n\nOn July 4, 2016, Dempsey\u2019s older brother, Delrawn Small, was fatally shot during a road-rage encounter in Brooklyn with NYPD officer Wayne Isaacs. Small was unarmed during the altercation. Dempsey had been weeping in the courtroom because 12 Brooklyn jurors, five of whom were black, had just acquitted Isaacs of murder and manslaughter charges.\n\nI wasn\u2019t surprised Isaacs walked. Intellectually, I know it\u2019s extremely rare for officers to be charged with a crime for fatal civilian encounter; it\u2019s even rarer to see a conviction. That tends to be true regardless of whether the person the cop killed is unarmed, underage, or in wheelchair. But despite everything I knew, hearing the result of Isaacs\u2019s trial still sent me into momentary shock.\n\nIn my eyes, this was another glaring case of the institutional racism that inordinately affects black people. It didn\u2019t matter that several of the jurors or the police officer were black. They all were role players in a judicial system set up to protect police officers who disproportionately target, abuse, and kill black people.\n\nBut the lethal impact of institutional racism doesn\u2019t just stop with policing. The harsh reality of American life for black people infects our health in insidious, covert ways.\n\n\u201cWhen you start to worry about something, whether that's race or something else, then that initiates a biological stress response,\u201d Berkeley School of Public Health researcher Amani M. Nuru-Jeter told NPR in November. \u201cProlonged elevation [and] circulation of the stress hormones in our bodies can be very toxic...It just gets us really out of whack and leaves us susceptible to a bunch of poor health outcomes.\"\n\nBlack journalists like myself who cover social justice beats experience that toxic stress like second-hand smoke. It hits me every time I write another story on extrajudicial murder, or police misconduct, or a Trayvon Martin Halloween costume. I certainly felt its pangs when I heard the \u201cnot guilty\u201d verdict in that Brooklyn courthouse.\n\nChristina Carrega\n\nNew York Daily News reporter Christina Carrega shared my feelings of frustration and despondency at the Isaacs trial. The 32-year-old veteran court reporter was sitting in front of me, documenting the case when Small\u2019s family erupted in anguish and anger.\n\n\u201cThe wailing of Small\u2019s sister, Victoria Davis, hit the back of my throat and caused my hand to shake,\u201d Carrega recalled to me.\n\nLater that night, Carrega did her usual post-work routine to cope with the pain: She smoked a Black & Mild on the balcony of her Manhattan apartment.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my way of dealing with it,\u201d Carrega said with a laugh. \u201cI have a bar in my apartment, but I don\u2019t even touch the alcohol because I feel like that could easily become a bad habit.\u201d\n\nMother Jones scribe Jamilah King has a different approach. \u201cI allow myself to binge on episodes of Blackish or Living Single,\u201d she told me. \u201cI cherish my friends who make me laugh and can sit with me in silence.\u201d\n\nKing was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay area, where Mario Woods was killed by police in December 2015. She detailed the aftermath of the tragedy for Mic.com.\n\nKing didn\u2019t know Woods, but they were both 80s babies and had mutual friends. And while covering his story, she realized they were also distant relatives.\n\n\u201cI struggled with reporting on his life and being part of a media that his family had grown to distrust,\u201d King recalled. \u201cHis death made me understand that the stakes are much higher for black reporters who do this work. That\u2019s a huge responsibility. It\u2019s also a privilege.\u201d\n\nLee Merritt\n\nDallas civil rights attorney Lee Merritt\u2019s burden is even heavier than many journalists\u2019.\n\nThe 34-year-old is the last hope for justice for many black families. For example, he currently represents the parents of Jordan Edwards, the unarmed black Texas teen who was fatally shot in the head by a Balch Springs police officer on April 29.\n\nWhile Merritt\u2019s mission in life is to help families like Edwards\u2019s seek justice, the work has taken a great toll on him. \u201cBefore I got into this line of work, I was really into fitness, leisure reading,\u201d Merritt told me. \u201cNow I have high blood pressure. At 34, that\u2019s kind of a big deal.\u201d\n\nMerritt\u2019s prominence in the civil rights community has made him a highly sought after attorney when police are accused of brutalizing or extralegally killing black people. Being there so often for other people of color\u2014up to 15 hours a day\u2014often prevented Merritt from being there for his ex-wife. The couple\u2019s six-year marriage ended in divorce in 2015.\n\n\u201cMy work didn\u2019t allow me to focus on home the way she anticipated or expected,\u201d the father of four said.\n\nIn 2015, Merritt founded the American Black Cross charity initiative, in part, because helping folks like needy Hurricane Harvey victims offers more instant gratification than waiting years for police-related court cases to play out. But outlets like this come with racially-charged stresses as well.\n\n\u201cWe get a lot of hate and hostility from conservatives and people who for whatever reason don\u2019t appreciate our work,\u201d Merritt said. \u201cBut the Black Cross allows us to go out and do things directly. It\u2019s almost like a built in vacation. It is work, but it\u2019s gratifying work.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Charlottesville - Race and Terror\n\nDue to the rise of racial tensions in recent years, journalists from all walks of life are forced to address these issues in their reporting. Fortune Magazine senior editor Ellen McGirt covered personal finances for two decades before her editorial team asked her to write about race and diversity in the businessworld beginning in 2015.\n\nMcGirt\u2019s first major story, on what prevents black Americans from becoming executives, ended up with her being hospitalized for two days.\n\n\u201cI had a massive stomach attack,\u201d McGirt recalled. \u201cIt was halfway through the assignment, it became this sort of soul crushing, yet exhilarating exercise of reporting. I talked to several black men who were very different from each other about what it\u2019s like being a black man. It wasn\u2019t until later that I realized the enormity of the question.\u201d\n\nHer story, \u201cLeading While Black: Why Race and Culture Matter in the C-suite\u201d was so popular, Fortune asked her to continue writing a daily email newsletter on race and diversity in the workplace titled raceAhead.\n\nMcGirt said the steady stream headlines of about tragedies like the police massacre in Dallas last year, debates over confederate statues, the Trump presidency, and neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, Virginia, have made talking about race at work a huge issue in the corporate world.\n\n\u201cOne of the things I was not prepared for as a business reporter was actually litigating the personality of Robert E. Lee,\u201d McGirt said, referencing her November 1 column responding to White House Chief of Staff John Kelly\u2019s defense of the oft-excused Confederate general. \u201cI\u2019m proud of the fact that I haven\u2019t been in the hospital for two years,\u201d she added, jokingly.\n\nAt times, the intractable nature of American racism can sometimes be too much for the people I spoke with to want to carry on in their work.\n\nAt one point in 2016, McGirt contemplated quitting her column.\n\n\u201cI had viewed so many actual videos of police violence that I said, \u2018I don\u2019t think I can continue,\u2019\u201d she told me. \u201cNothing in my background had trained me for this. At that point, I did everything I could to make sure I\u2019m as healthy as I could possibly be.\u201d\n\nTo ward off her stress, McGirt took up healthy exercise habits, like hiking through the scenic terrain of the parks near her St. Louis, Missouri home.\n\n\u201cI find the only thing that really breaks it for me is moving,\u201d she said. \u201cI do yoga and pilates\u2026 Moving is essential.\u201d\n\nAfter my moment in that Brooklyn courthouse in November, I\u2019m beginning to realize a little more routine cardio is probably not a bad idea.\n\nFollow Chauncey on Twitter.", "image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5a29b6f3301b6f16e96612f7/lede/1512683340402-StressWeek-ReportingRacism-Web.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "subject": "stress"}, "1c3310e9db620ccda030b511f959f505": {"title": "Is Elf on the Shelf adding more stress?", "summary": "You adopt the elf, it comes into your home, watches your child&#39;s behavior and then reports it all back to Santa.

Get away from our normally busy routines and recharge \u2013 treat yourself to a sleep-in, read a new book, or go for a bushwalk or trip to the beach\n\n2. Take a break, switch off from technology and focus on celebrating with your family\n\n3. Connect with loved ones that you haven\u2019t spoken with in a while. As well as immediate family, contact a more distant relative or an old friend you may have lost regular contact with\n\n4. Christmas is a reminder to me that not everyone will have shelter, warmth, food and love around them at this time of year. So take some time to be grateful for all that you have and share a little of this with others less fortunate. Even a smile can go a long way in a lonely person\u2019s world\n\n5. The festive season is such a joyous occasion but it can be a tough time for some, where we remember and talk about our loved ones who are not at the Christmas table. It is so important that in all the excitement and celebration we take the time to listen and support family and friends, check in and ask \u201chow are you doing?\u201d\n\n6. We can sometimes experience high temperatures over the Christmas and New Year period. Water slides in the back yard, swimming in the river, lakes and swimming pools will be high on everyone\u2019s agenda, as will opening gifts, drinking alcohol and eating wonderful fresh food. It is great to celebrate with family and friends but we need to remember that everything in moderation is the key to enjoying the end of 2017 and the beginning of 2018\n\n7. Christmas is a chance to take time out, share food with others and hope that the coming year is even better than the last\n\n8. Christmas, for some families, can be a sad time of the year. Be mindful of others and reach out to people who need it\n\n9. Families can feel a lot of pressure at Christmas time, particularly when it comes to finances. Share the stress \u2013 share the cost\n\n10. Spend some time in nature; stop, breathe and appreciate\n\n11. The festive season may see our alcohol intake increase. Try to have alcohol-free days, and when you are drinking, keep up your water intake and remember to eat\n\n12. During the \u2018silly season\u2019, it's especially important to keep the basic things in place to keep yourself healthy. Make sure you get enough sleep, drink lots of water and exercise. This solid foundation will go a long way to getting you through this often hectic time of year\n\n13. It\u2019s important to keep Christmas in perspective. The day is about spending time with people you love.

Several reports about majors that landed in my email inbox recently highlight why the decision is so fraught for so many students who see it as tantamount to choosing a career. The data about majors are often confusing and sometimes contradictory. Here\u2019s some of what I learned from reading these studies.\n\nMen and women segregate themselves by major. Men major in engineering and computer science; women major in nursing, education, social work. That\u2019s the conclusion from a forthcoming study to be published by Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Education and the Workforce.\n\nWomen constitute just 10 percent of electrical engineering majors, 8 percent of mechanical engineering majors and 20 percent of computer science majors. Meanwhile, only 12 percent of nursing majors are men, and men represent 14 percent of majors in social work and 4 percent in early childhood education.\n\nAnthony P. Carnevale, the Georgetown center\u2019s director, says segregation by major partly explains the gender gap when it comes to pay after college because men tend to choose majors that pay more.\n\n\u201cThe shift from an industrial to a post-industrial economy has benefited women generally, but college-educated women not so much,\u201d Carnevale said. \u201cMen chase the money, while women chase their passions even in the same field.\u201d\n\nCollege officials who see these trends play out on their campuses are reluctant to talk about them out of fear their comments might come off as sexist. Women, they say, pursue their passions \u2014 whether it pays off or not \u2014 while men go for the money. \u201cWe really narrowly define passion,\u201d said Laurel Kennedy, vice president for student development at Denison University, where within six months after graduation, women are three times more likely than men to be employed in service fields, such as AmeriCorps or Teach for America. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about the ability to care for your family as a laudable goal.\u201d\n\nMajors are changeable. For all the anxiety around picking a major among high school students, it\u2019s very likely they will change their mind. Some 52 percent of students change their intended major between the time they first take the SAT or ACT and the time they apply for college, according to Royall & Co., a firm that assists colleges with their student recruitment.\n\nIf students don\u2019t change their major before they get to college, they might once they are there. A report released this month by the U.S. Education Department\u2019s National Center for Education Statistics found that nearly one-third of first-time college students change their majors at least once within three years. Students who chose education or humanities as their first majors were more likely to switch than those who selected business or engineering. The major most likely to switch: math.\n\nStudents change majors for a variety of reasons. In the case of math, it might be it turns out to be more difficult in college than it was in high school. In other cases, students see jobs up close as interns and decide a field is not for them. Or they succumb to pressure to pick a practical major their parents think will lead to a job.\n\nDespite conventional wisdom, choosing a major early on \u2014 even before arriving on campus \u2014 and sticking with it doesn\u2019t necessarily guarantee you\u2019ll get out of college any faster, or even on time. Indeed, students who settle on a major the first semester of freshman year graduate at slightly lower rates than those who decide on one their second semester, according to research by EAB, a higher education consulting company, based on six years of data involving more than 78,000 students. After that, it doesn\u2019t much matter.\n\nWatch where you get advice about choosing a major. More than half of students turn to their family and friends for counseling on picking a major, according to a survey released this fall from Gallup and the Strada Education Network. But the study found that those most common sources of advice were also the least useful.\n\nWhen asked what advice was most helpful, 83 percent of students cited advice from employers or co-workers, or from people with experience in an intriguing line of work. That\u2019s well above the scores of 66 percent for college counselors and 61 percent for high school counselors.\n\nThe problem is few students turned to those more formal sources of advice. Only 20 percent said they got advice from informal work sources; 11 percent had sought guidance from a high school counselor; and 28 percent from a college adviser.\n\nStudents today are commonly told they should follow their passions and find a mission in life, but very few 18-year-olds or even 22-year-olds have enough experience in the world to know what truly excites them. Pick a major that interests you, but allow it and external experiences to help shape, not dictate, your mission in life. While you should consider different majors, and you should keep your options open for a while, don\u2019t think you can do anything you want. Talent and drive matter to success in most majors, of course. You can\u2019t major in physics, after all, if you\u2019re terrible at math.", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "subject": "anxiety"}, "7b3824a9107d362e3f99e6bf564725c8": {"title": "Warren: We are living in an age of anxiety \u2014 stresses are piling up and the young lack skills to cope", "summary": "We all experience periods of anxiety in our lives.

Feeling some anxiety in response to events like writing exams, getting married, starting a new job or an unexpected financial loss is natural.\n\nBut more and more people in this country, and around the world, are suffering from symptoms of anxiety even when these stressors are not occurring in their daily lives. They have lost control over how their bodies and minds react to normal, everyday stress.\n\nIt\u2019s immobilizing thousands of young and adult Canadians who are suffering from various forms of anxiety disorder. The symptoms include excessive worry, trouble sleeping, panic attacks, nausea, muscle tension, trauma flashbacks and nervousness in social settings.\n\nAnxiety turns into a disorder when its sensations and symptoms interfere with normal life.\n\nThe problem begins with our young people. The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health conducted a study involving more than 10,000 students in Grades 7 through 12 in 220 schools across Ontario. It examined the prevalence of anxiety symptoms, such as feeling nervous, hopeless, worthless or depressed.\n\nThe findings are disturbing. One-third of students in the survey were found to have moderate to severe symptoms of physiological distress. That\u2019s up from two years earlier when one-quarter suffered the same levels of mental illness. And 14 per cent of students met the criteria for \u201cserious\u201d physiological distress, up from 10 per cent only a few years ago.\n\nOlder teens spend more than five hours daily on social media, which is known to have mental health effects as users worry about its overwhelming demands. They\u2019re also concerned about student debt, job prospects, a diminished sense of safety and the depressing state of the world with commonplace bombings, shootings, famine and the killing of innocent civilians.\n\nPart of the problem is parents who try to bring up their children in anxiety-free bubbles. When those children eventually enter the world on their own, they\u2019re ill-equipped to deal with the conveyer belt of challenges in everyday life. They lack the necessary problem-solving skills.\n\nOnly one in five young people get the mental health help they need. Dr. Robert Mann, the head researcher for the Centre for Addiction study, says improving the mental health literacy of teenagers has the potential to deliver similar results as early intervention and education programs in schools had in lowering substance abuse among teenagers over the last two decades.\n\nFor adults, the main source of anxiety is money. Little wonder. The Canadian Payroll Association 2017 survey finds spending levels and debt remain high. Nearly half of our overall workforce is living paycheque to paycheque. And \u201cdespite some economic gains, most employed Canadians continue to fall short of meeting their retirement savings goals,\u201d the survey reports.\n\nHanging over all this is the rising cost of living and real possibility of either an interest rate increase or a major economic turndown.\n\nThe association acknowledges people have difficulty changing or reducing their spending habits. It suggests setting up an automatic payroll deduction of 10 per cent of net income. In other words, pay yourself first before you pay others.\n\nThat\u2019s helpful, but it doesn\u2019t take away the anxiety that comes with job-killing automation, stagnant wages, rising prices and an uncertain economic future.\n\nMoney anxiety is prevalent among millennials in particular.\n\nMore than a quarter of them say financial stress affects their job performance \u2014 more than twice the rate of the general population. Anxiety over money made a quarter of millennials feel physically ill and more than half feel depressed according to a U.S. study.\n\nMoney isn\u2019t the only omnipresent source of anxiety. The Geopolitical Anxiety Index (GAI) measures the number of news stories that cover 10 different geopolitical risks topics. The current reading shows anxiety is at the highest point since the Arab Spring in 2011.\n\nThe investment bank JPMorgan told its clients recently, \u201cSince President Trump\u2019s election, news coverage around topics such as war, terrorism and cyber-attacks has surged.\u201d\n\nThere is some good news for Canadians. We appear to be less stressed over the economy than those in most other countries, including the United States. (The most stressed areas of the world continue to be the Middle East and Africa.)\n\nThis year is going down as a good year for the Canadian economy. Annualized growth of about 2.5 per cent and 290,000 jobs created thus far is encouraging. Unemployment is low at 6.1 per cent and the bankruptcy rate has slowed.\n\nFor those struggling to pay their bills and manage down debt, the experts agree on three things. First, acknowledge you have a problem. Second, seek professional help. And finally, start paying yourself first.\n\nBut it will take more than a modest economy to help the thousands of young Canadians who desperately need easier access to better mental health services.\n\nChildren\u2019s Mental Health Ontario\u2019s latest survey found nearly half of 18- to 34-year-olds missed school due to issues related to anxiety.

He said the children were met in an unpleasant condition before being rescued and their parents were met before they were re-united with them.\n\n\n\nAsked why Mr. Iloh is still being held after the parents admitted taking their children there, he said the outcome of the investigation would determine the next line of action.\n\n\n\nDespite the official response of the agency, Daily Trust learnt that residents of the community are not comfortable with the operations of the centre due to the inhuman condition and cruelty meted to children.\n\n\n\nIt was learnt that Ikoh maltreated the children and used starvation, beating with specialized canes and chaining for days as methods of his \u201ctreatment\u201d.

I left a nonprofit job that had a hard pay ceiling, and I started to pursue my passion for writing. My boyfriend of nearly four years, James, was supportive of my chasing my dream. I expected lots of hard work and time spent in front of my computer. What I didn\u2019t expect was the anxiety.\n\nSince I\u2019ve officially become a freelancer, my income has never been the same month to month. I\u2019ve always been able to pay my bills, and I do have a healthy savings account. But the instability of freelancing has caused me to experience anxiety like never before in my life.\n\nTo get our best wellness tips delivered to you inbox, sign up for the Healthy Living newsletter\n\nFor me, anxiety feels like a tightening in my chest and a tendency to obsess over one thing. (Why didn\u2019t that editor respond to my email yet? Why???) Freelancing brought anxiety into my life in waves. I had to complete the writing and edits, and grow a social media following\u2014plus do the invoicing, quarterly taxes, and recording of payments. I was making more money, but it came with more anxiety.\n\nAnxiety, meet depression\n\nAs I was experiencing work-induced anxiety, James was dealing with depression. In the same way that my anxiety hit in waves, he would have days where he felt mired in depressing thoughts.\n\nRELATED: 15 Inspiring Things Celebrities Have Said About Dealing With Anxiety\n\nFor him, depression manifests as a feeling of hopelessness about the future. While I was an anxious mess over how to create stability month to month, he dealt with frustration and sadness about the world at large. (Not helped by today's news cycle!) He works at an company that helps protect the environment, but the constant news about climate change and cuts in funding to the EPA sapped his positivity. It\u2019s easy to believe the worst when something you care about is always under attack.\n\nMental illness had wormed its way into our relationship, and it brought challenges with it. In my case, when I was in the grip of anxiety and feeling awful, it was easy for me to blame things outside of myself: My partner didn\u2019t do as much housework as I did, or he wasn\u2019t as ambitious as I was. He was the cause of my anxiety, and he needed to change.\n\nIn James' case, his depression prevented him from noticing the good things in his life and the world around us. He was continually drawn to the negatives, and he failed to notice the positives. That heightened my anxiety, because sometimes all we would talk about were the endless problems we saw.\n\nRELATED: Surprising Causes of Winter Depression\n\nWhile sometimes it feels great to blame someone in the moment, all I was doing was adding more stress to my life. I was trying to control things that were outside of my control. Rather than saying, \u2018I'm struggling with financial and professional uncertainty, which makes me feel anxious about the future,\u2019 I looked for someone to blame around me, and landed on my partner.\n\nOur communication began to suffer because we only heard things through the filter of our mental illnesses. It became clear that while we loved each other deeply, we weren't always being good partners.\n\nThe relationship wasn\u2019t broken in any way; our individual behaviors were just weighing us down. It wasn\u2019t that his beliefs or behaviors were incompatible with mine (of vice versa). We loved being around each other, and we shared the same political, social and ethical views. But we were each falling into negative cycles that hijacked our thoughts. I was stressed about money, so I talked about money nonstop. James was sad at the devastation caused by climate change, and he blamed his own actions (like driving to work).\n\nWe realized that we each needed to sort some things out. We talked about it on two different occasions, and we decided to enter individual therapy to get some help. Our battles with depression and anxiety stemmed from us as individuals, not as a couple. We didn\u2019t have the tools we needed to deal the right way, so we went looking for them.\n\nRELATED: 20 Celebrities Who Battled Depression\n\nSaved by therapy\n\nHaving time each week to focus on ourselves and talk through life with an impartial third party was invaluable. Therapy offers a chance to get things off your chest. For me, that meant a safe place to voice my work frustrations and fears. My therapist helped me see that my frustration didn\u2019t originate with my partner\u2019s actions; it stems from the instability of freelancing.\n\nTherapy also gave us tools to communicate. We learned how to say to each other, \u2018I\u2019m feeling X, and I need Y from you right now.\u2019 We found it helpful to simply identify our anxious or sad feelings out loud. Saying \u2018I\u2019m feeling really anxious right now\u2019 told my partner why I was behaving in a certain way and showed him that he wasn\u2019t to blame. Opening up when we were struggling gave the other person a clear understanding of what was going on without making the other responsible for fixing it.\n\nRight now, we\u2019ve each been in therapy for around five months. My anxiety is much better; I can recognize when it\u2019s growing, and I have tools to stop it before it causes a professional or personal problem. One tool in particular is journaling. I can write out my feelings and organize them on paper, which helps me identify the root of them. I also started a weekly video call with other freelancers, so we can talk about problems we\u2019re having and get support from one another. I can bring my work issues to people with the same issues\u2014instead of my partner.\n\nRELATED: 12 Signs You May Have an Anxiety Disorder\n\nOur experiences with mental illnesses have brought us closer in some ways. We\u2019ve seen each other deal with some tough experiences, and we\u2019ve functioned as sources of support for each other. We talk through everything as a couple\u2014something I\u2019m thankful for.\n\nDating with mental illness isn\u2019t always hard, but it isn\u2019t always easy. I know that as long as I continue to freelance, I will have periods of intense anxiety. I know that James will deal with depression for periods of his life. It\u2019s a never-ending dance, but we've found the tools and resources to make it more of a waltz than a face plant.", "image": "http://cdn-img.health.com/sites/default/files/styles/medium_16_9/public/styles/main/public/gettyimages-558118851_1_0.jpg?itok=ri3J8hFr", "subject": "depression"}, "b201e8ee8cfd2cc6985b6f9818ee4556": {"title": "VR is shifting how we experience anxiety, surgery, pain and games", "summary": "Whether speaking about using Virtual Reality to play games or to get to play doctor prior to surgery, VR is shifting how we experience anxiety, pain, surgery, fun, and games, and occasionally, these experiences overlap.

The promotion is a two-week, free trial that includes the headset, a PlayStation camera (a necessary component), 2 PlayStation Move controllers, a copy of the role-playing game \u201cThe Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim VR\u201d, and demo disc.\n\nDemo users have to provide their own PS4 game system and provide a credit card to be charged in the event that you purposefully or accidentally keep the demo unit after the 14 days, although either way, the cost is about $150 less to keep the demo package than to buy it retail.\n\nIn a press release regarding a new VR experience, WarDucks of Ireland, a VR gaming and experience startup, announced the release of the RollerCoaster Legends project across multiple platforms (Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and PSVR) for Christmas. The new experience takes on Greek mythology and icons with mythical scenes and enchanting characters along with the traditional drops and turns for players expected in a rollercoaster experience.\n\nNikki Lannen, CEO of WarDucks, said of the new release, \u201cWe love rollercoasters here at WarDucks but felt what is out there is lacking in certain ways. Many of the rollercoasters available are not focused on a virtual environment and are simply badly built replicas of what is available in real life. We feel as though we have built something which gives the thrill of a rollercoaster but also provides an engaging, interesting experience at the same time.\u201d\n\nPeople-centered immersive designs for VR experiences and games are important for much more than just entertainment, as research into pain and anxiety are demonstrating.\n\nFor example, in 2005, Australian researchers helped children who were burn-patients by using VR games during painful procedures, such as dressing changes, based on prior research that concluded that these VR games helped adult burn-patients. The perception of the nurses assisting the procedures was that the children were distracted more and cooperated more than when using just traditional pain relief medication. The VR use was not an impediment to the procedure nor in the communication with the children. From what the children reported, \u201cThe average pain scores (from the Faces Scale) for pharmacological analgesia only was 4.1 (SD 2.9), while VR coupled with pharmacological analgesia, the average pain score was 1.3 (SD 1.8).\u201d The parents of the children concurred with the positive effects of VR for noticeably better pain management and reduced anxiety, including the children looking forward to playing the VR game.\n\nThey concluded, \u201cIntervention with Virtual Reality (VR) games is based on distraction or interruption in the way current thoughts, including pain, are processed by the brain. The study provides strong evidence supporting VR based games in providing analgesia with minimal side effects and little impact on the physical hospital environment, as well as its reusability and versatility, suggesting another option in the management of children\u2019s acute pain.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to anxiety, in particular in regards to medical procedures, and to patient expectations and education, much research has been done to explain problems, correlations, and suggestions for corrective ideas.\n\nIn 2009, US researchers presented a specific problem with patient understanding and consent and said, \u201cComprehension during informed consent discussions may be limited in individuals with potential language difficulty due to ethnicity or education.\u201d\n\nIn 2001, published their findings that across the studies reviewed, they discovered \u201cthe need for clinicians to clarify patients\u2019 expectations and to assist them in having appropriate expectations of recovery\u201d. Their conclusion was, \u201cthe understanding of the nature, extent and clinical implications of the relation between expectations and outcomes could be enhanced by more conceptually driven and methodologically sound research, including evaluations of intervention effectiveness.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, Irish researchers made several key findings: \u201cUnderstanding in surgical patients is poor. There is little evidence to support the use of information leaflets, although multimedia appears to be effective in improving patient understanding. The internet is not used effectively as an aid to consent by health care providers. Patients with lower educational levels may gain most from additional interventions. Improving patient understanding does not impact on their satisfaction with the treatment they have received but may reduce periprocedural anxiety. There is a need for greater awareness of patients\u2019 information needs, and novel approaches that may enhance decision making through improved understanding are required.\n\nThis year, Indian researchers offered meta-analysis, \u201cpreoperative education reduced anxiety scores (standardized mean difference).\u201d\n\nAlso this year, researchers in Spain considered 200 patients waiting to undergo cardiac surgery and then reported, \u201cTwenty-eight percent of the patients developed high preoperative anxiety\u201d and \u201cBoth fear of the unknown and lack of information, especially related to the surgery, are crucial factors in high levels of preoperative anxiety in cardiac surgery.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, more Australian researchers examined 17 eligible trials reported data on 2689 cardiac surgery participants and then determined, \u201cPreoperative intervention significantly reduced the time to extubation and the relative risk of developing postoperative pulmonary complications. However, it did not significantly affect the length of stay in ICU or hospital, except among older participants.\u201d\n\nEarly this year, researchers from The Netherlands offered their results on brain surgery on patients who must be awake during the surgery and said, \u201cAwake surgery emerges as a standard of care for brain tumors located in or near eloquent areas. Levels of preoperative anxiety in patients are important because anxiety can influence cognitive performance and participation, hence altering the outcome of the procedure\u201d. They stated, \u201cone in every four patients reported significant anxiety symptoms in the pre-operative phase. Besides gender and age, none of the other demographic or medical factors were significantly associated with the level of anxiety.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, an Ohio startup, Surgical Theater, was born in the VR medtech spectrum, taking traditional 2D xrary images from CT and MRI scans, then creating a patient-unique 3D file that can be viewed in VR and allowing viewers to not only see the path to the surgery site but also seeing what is in the 360 degrees around them at any moment.\n\nThe co-founders Moty Avisar and Alon Geri have extensive backgrounds in flight simulation that they turned into this idea of brain surgery simulation. Their goals were threefold. First, they wanted to give doctors the opportunity to plan and rehearse surgeries the way pilots do for missions on simulators, and then, they wanted to connect that concept with doctors who train new surgeons. Finally, they wanted to mitigate anxiety held by patients and their families before surgeries. Surgical Theater is utilized at academic hospitals, including UCLA, New York University, University Hospitals Case Medical Center, Mayo Clinic, Mount Sinai, and Stanford University.\n\nMalie Collins worked previously as the Senior VR Program Lead at Surgical Theater and now works with the chair of neurosurgery at Stanford University, Gary K. Steinberg MD, Ph.D. Malie builds the image reconstructions in 3D and prepares the patient-specific VR cases for Dr. Steinberg. Together, they created the Neurological Simulation and Virtual Reality Center, the first VR clinic for spine and neurosurgery in the United States.\n\nAfer creating the VR cases for Dr. Steinburg, Malie creates a special \u201cfly through\u201d VR video for patients and their families.\n\nIn one recent example, the night before Felicia Luna\u2019s brain surgery for an aneurysm, Collins had Felicia and her husband Rene watch the \u201cfly through\u201d video. Luna was a \u201cnervous wreck\u201d before seeing the video. Luna said, \u201cNow I understand exactly what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d Rene agreed, \u201cThis makes me understand it 100 percent. That extra understanding gives me a lot more confidence.\u201d\n\nUsing Surgical Theater\u2019s technology, The Seattle Science Foundation, with the help of former Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Ricardo Lockette, has started a 5-year, 15-million-dollar initiative to create a comprehensive Spinal Cord Atlas in 3D to be able to help other patients, who like Ricardo \u201cThe Rocket\u201d Lockette, become paralyzed. While Ricardo Lockette was fortunate enough to be able to walk again, his experience gave him an exit from playing professional football and an entrance into the arena of MedTech to help others who have suffered a spinal cord injury. Their hope is that once precisely mapped, the spinal cord could be operated on with bioelectronics, inserting \u201celectrodes into eloquent nuclei of the cord with a precision that would allow for stimulation of specific muscles. Such stimulation might afford a paralyzed patient the ability to move muscles below the level of their injury.\u201d\n\nSometimes the topic is not an acute medical situation; sometimes the topic is the anxiety felt in everyday situations that impacts chronic health, so WarDucks has a business-to-business VR app that addresses coping with anxiety using VR meditation. WarDucks CEO Nikki Lannen said, \u201cVR is the ideal platform for meditation, especially for those who find it difficult to shut off. VR in the workplace makes even more sense as you can totally shut off from your hectic environment. It minimizes anxiety and increases productivity.\u201d\n\nTo better enhance pain management using bioelectronics, another athlete turned MedTech story comes from a press release on Will Rosellini, the ex-minor leaguer turned bioelectronics expert who, by creating Nexeon, aims to improve the quality of life of patients suffering from debilitating neurological disease and drastically change how we approach the human nervous system.\n\nNexeon\u2019s brain implant \u2014 which exists today \u2014 is one of three devices in the world that that can record brain function in real-time and stimulate other parts of the brain.\n\nThis year, researchers in Japan examined the impact on 5th-year medical students using 3D monitoring systems with neurosurgical operations in a 6 year program and found, \u201citems for which the students reported positive perceptions (scores of 4 or 5) were stereopsis (67.2% of students), neurosurgical interest (62.5%), visual impact and optical sharpness (60.9% for both), active learning enhancement (57.8%), and comprehension of surgical anatomy (50.0%) and procedures (42.2%). By contrast, only eye exhaustion was evaluated negatively (26.6%).\u201d They thus verified the advantages of 3D monitoring systems in medical education and learned that improvement is required to decrease the students\u2019 eye exhaustion.\n\nThis story originally appeared on Techli.", "image": "https://sociable.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/virtual-reality-doctor-1000x600.jpg", "subject": "anxiety"}, "4f6f834411ba81d0cf8e0552bfc9bda1": {"title": "Anxiety and hearth health", "summary": "Can anxiety feel like you have heart issues?

One proven way to help with anxiety (proven, though it doesn't always work with everyone) is a type of therapy called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) - you can find either a therapist to work with you individually or they have CBT group classes - but typically it's a relatively short term therapy of about 10-12 weeks; but it can be very helpful.Medications for anxiety out there are primarily short-term because they can be addictive and they don't treat the cause of the anxiety.HEre's a couple links about CBT and anxietyandThere is much more out there to read about CBT and anxiety that you could look up.Good luckDebbie", "image": "https://messageboards.webmd.com/cfs-filesystemfile/__key/themefiles/s-fd-14a66b20bea946efbee093c01c1559b5-files/favicon.ico", "subject": "anxiety"}, "25935949f2eec00941ac1350f75d2ca0": {"title": "When to Let Your Kid Quit (and When Not to)", "summary": "She had never been on a team in her life, but with puberty impending I thought she should get some exercise.

Before the season, he was genuinely excited to play (which is sort of remarkable when one considers his three-year lifetime record is 0-27), so I paid the money and requested his uniform.\n\n\n\nAnd still, I practically encouraged him to quit.\n\nThree years ago, I signed my daughter up for water polo. She had never been on a team in her life, but with puberty impending I thought she should get some exercise. Through tears, anxiety attacks and a good deal of nudging, my daughter was made to push through a tough start. Although she wanted to quit many times, I wouldn\u2019t allow her to ditch the team.\n\nNow, three years later, water polo is her life.\n\nWhy the different approaches for my kids? Let me explain.\n\nThese days, young children don\u2019t have a lot of down time. They are typically signed up for a wide range of afterschool activities, from music lessons and baseball to tutoring and Scouts. Try finding a playdate on a Wednesday afternoon and you will see what I mean. Kids are booked up. This can be a good thing. Some kids are spending up to seven hours a day looking at screens. Getting them out of the house and off their devices is beneficial.\n\nOccasionally, however, things don\u2019t go as planned.\n\nFor a variety of reasons, there are times when a child wants to call it quits. It then becomes a tricky parenting decision whether to let them opt out or to force completion. The most typical argument against quitting is that quitting begets quitting. Doing it once makes it all too easy to quit when life gets hard. However, there are often very compelling reasons children should be released from a commitment.\n\nWhen to Stick\n\nFor some children, starting something new brings on a tsunami of fear and anxiety. It doesn\u2019t matter how much they want to do it or if it was their own idea. The anxiety of a new social situation or of the requirements of the activity can be overwhelming. This was always the case with my daughter. The same quitting desire reared its head whenever she began any new endeavor. Quitting for the anxious child can become a way of life if she is never taught how to manage distress. Instead of dropping out, use calming techniques to help the child keep it together. Provide support during the class as needed. With each successful stressful situation the child conquers, strength and resiliency are bolstered for the future.\n\nSimilarly, children who tend to be quitters in general when life just doesn\u2019t go their way should be encouraged stick it out. Some kids struggle with losing or not being the best or most valuable player. Their inclination may be to pooh-pooh the league, coach or other players right before begging to drop out. These kids need to be pushed to persevere through less than ideal circumstances. That\u2019s when growth happens. The child doesn\u2019t have to sign up again for the activity but must finish out the season.\n\nWhen to Call It Quits\n\nParents sometimes can\u2019t help but live out their unfulfilled dreams through their children. (Seriously, we are all guilty of this at times.) And some parents push kids into activities for the sake of checking off boxes on the inevitable college application. The problem is that when the activity is more for the parent than the child, massive amounts of nagging and arguing ensue to keep the child on task. If a child is begging to quit an activity that he previously devoted a good deal of time and effort to but is no longer interested in, let it go. There is no value in demanding a child continue with piano or Taekwondo just because you\u2019ve invested seven years. Think of the opportunity cost here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are occasions when kids are signed up for an activity at the wrong level. Maybe it\u2019s traveling soccer or competitive diving or Triple A baseball. But after the start it turns out the child isn\u2019t really up to the task due to no fault of his own. Let the child level down or step out.\n\nThere is one more occasion when children should be allowed out of their commitment\u2014when it\u2019s just no fun for anyone. Occasionally, coaches are abusive, players are bullies or the program is dangerously disorganized. This was the case before my son\u2019s recent drop out. The young hired coach (who didn\u2019t know my son\u2019s name after two weeks) barely batted an eye when my son struggled to breathe. It was all drills, no personal connection and no enjoyment. Sometimes being on the team causes undue stress on the child or family. When the strain outweighs the joy, drop out.\n\nThere is one caveat for quitting. When a player departs a squad it can negatively affect everyone left on that team. Parents should work to minimize the impact on others whenever possible.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nActivities are meant to be fun and enriching as well as character and skill building. Parents should choose sports and classes carefully and work to prepare children to avoid the need to quit. However, if there is a persuasive reason, don\u2019t waste anyone\u2019s time.

So much so, that the additional stress/anxiety can interfere with a parent\u2019s ability to enjoy the holidays, which, of course, impacts the kids as well, because they have exhausted and grumpy parents. What do we do?\n\nDr. Erin Leonard, Psychotherapist, breaks down the best ways to tackle the stress/anxiety in a positive way.\n\nAnxiety is like a glass of water. Anxiety is the water. You are the glass. Everyday life fills the glass up with water, but as adults, there are things we do that dump a little water out as we go, to keep the water from overflowing, i.e: working out, Netflix, a glass of wine with a friend, or getting a massage. Yet, there is far less time for these activities during the holidays, so what can parents do?\n\nGet more bang for your buck. A mind and body practice, like yoga, tai chi, martial arts, and meditation are activities that allow you to feel whole, grounded, centered, and soothed. In other words, a mind and body practice dumps the most water out in the shortest amount of time. This is key during the holidays.\n\nMind and body practices do the following:\n\nAlleviate anxiety and stress, and allow you to feel soothed and present, so you can enjoy your kids during the holidays.\n\nProvide you with a workout so you can feel good and eat without worry.\n\nAllow you to remember the deeper meaning of the holidays, which is love, not obligation. (It\u2019s okay to say no to holiday invites in order to stay home and spend time with your family.)\n\nAre easy to do because you can do a mind and body practice anywhere: close your office door and do 3 yoga poses, do 15 minutes of tai chi while you\u2019re waiting for your holiday cookies to cool, meditate for 10 minutes while you wait for your kids to get home from school.\n\nA mind and body practice requires the mind and body to intricately collaborate toward a common goal. This collaboration allows the person to feel whole and centered, which is a great feeling during the holidays.\n\nPart 2: How to Deal with Difficult Family Members during the Holidays\n\nEveryone has a difficult family member who seems to create tension and ruin the holidays for everybody. For example, an overly critical mother-in-law, a know-it-all cousin who dominates every conversation, an uncle who takes every joke too far, or an aunt who can\u2019t keep her political opinion to herself. These characters can induce anxiety in people\u2019s days and weeks before the holidays. So, how do people prepare?\n\nExpect bad behavior. Hoping that these characters will behave leads to anticipatory anxiety which is the worst. Don\u2019t hope they behave. Expect that they won\u2019t and plan a polite escape to the restroom or the car to get a \u201cforgotten\u201d present.\n\nDon\u2019t engage. This cast of characters thrive on pushing people\u2019s buttons and getting people riled up, so do not let them have the chance. Do not engage or respond to below the belt comments.\n\nRealize that they lack the capacity to understand that their words and actions negatively impact others. In other words, they can\u2019t see beyond their own noses. So, perceiving them as immature children trapped in an adult body sometimes helps.\n\nVisit www.drerinleonard.com for more helpful tips!\n\nSEGMENT IS SPONSORED BY DR.

They also submitted a second application for additional tuition fees to be waived as part of the Free Fees Initiative on medical ground also, which is separate from the \u20ac3,000 contribution charge. The student\u2019s tutor, Professor Stefan Hutzler of the Physics department, had sent the application to the Senior Lecturer, Dr. Gillian Martin, for fees to be waived on September 25, but was only processed and consequently accepted on December 1. On December 6, the student was informed by Academic Registry that she had been withdrawn from College.\n\nThe student first contacted her tutor on April 14 with regards to not completing end of year exams and the academic year, saying: \u201cI\u2019ve recently been diagnosed with depression and have been struggling to cope with college for the last few months.\u201d\n\nProf. Hutzler informed her that she had qualified for the medical repeat on May 3, and that they would apply to the Free Fees Initiative at a later stage. In order to complete the form, the student needed a certificate of fitness to return to College for the 2017/18 academic year, which was completed by her local doctor who had treated her and returned to Prof. Hutzler on July 26.\n\nOn September 11, Prof. Hutzler, informed her that she would need to visit the Student Counselling Service (SCS) to complete the form to apply for free fees, as the certificate from her local doctor was not approved. In the email to Prof. Hutzler, the student stated that she was not informed that she would have to visit SCS to apply for her fees to be covered. \u201cThis was something that was never made clear to me,\u201d and said that she was told over the phone that \u201cthey wouldn\u2019t be able to fill out this form for me as they have no insight into the grounds for which I\u2019m repeating the year\u201d. However, the SCS said that they would contact the Senior Lecturer, Dr. Martin, about the case.\n\nIn a follow up email dated September 17 to Hutzler, after not receiving response on to how to proceed, the student said: \u201cI\u2019m due back to college on Monday [September 25] and if I\u2019m honest I\u2019m completely stressed and upset about where I stand. I\u2019ve absolutely no idea how to proceed. I can\u2019t complete registration without fee payment and I can\u2019t access my timetable without registering.\u201d\n\nOn September 20, Prof. Hutzler said that he had received a response from Dr. Martin, which said: \u201cI write to acknowledge receipt of medical documentation stating [the student] is fit to return to full time study in academic year 2017/18. [The student] may register for her year in the normal way.\u201d Prof. Hutzler acknowledged to the student that Dr. Martin\u2019s response did not address her application for her fees to be covered this academic year, and attached a second different form for her local doctor to complete.\n\nBy September 25, the student\u2019s local doctor had returned the completed form, and Prof. Hutzler had sent the application onto Dr. Martin on the same day.\n\nBy November 9, her application had not been processed. In an email to the student, Prof. Hutzler said: \u201cI just sent a reminder message to the Senior Lecturer\u2019s office. I am not satisfied with this delay, let\u2019s hope it will be sorted soon.\u201d\n\nDespite a reminder email sent to Dr. Martin\u2019s office on November 9 by Prof. Hutzler, on November 17 an email from Academic Registry marked as \u201curgent\u201d was sent to the student with regards to paying fees for this academic year. The email read: \u201cAs per College regulations and previous communications, students who have not completed online registration before Wednesday 29th November 2017 will be deemed to be withdrawn and services such as the Library, Blackboard, the College Network and ID cards will be suspended. In such circumstances, students must apply to the Senior Lecturer\u2026for readmission and pay a late registration and readmission fee of \u20ac358.\u201d\n\nProf. Hutzler replied on November 17, and said that he sent her message to Dr. Martin. By November 23, Prof. Hutzler had not received a response from Dr. Martin. In an email to the student, Prof. Hutzler said that Student Cases apologises for \u201chaving not yet progressed your application form sent in September 25\u201d and \u201chaving not responded to my two emails (Nov 11 and Nov 17) asking about the state of your application\u201d. Prof. Hutzler said that \u201cyou will NOT be made withdrawn on the 28th of November and there will be NO late registration fee. This is a farce that should not have happened and I have complained about this in strong words.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Academic Registry informed the student that she was on a list of students with open cases that would not be withdrawn as it had not been assessed at that point. The student\u2019s case was due to be assessed on December 1, and on December 4, she received confirmation that her free fees for this year had been granted.\n\nBy December 6, the student had been withdrawn from Trinity by Academic Registry, despite her application for a medical repeat and free fees being accepted. She no longer has use of Blackboard, her ID card, IT Services, the Library and other College services.\n\nIn a statement to Trinity News, the student said: \u201cI\u2019ve had a tough enough year personally without having to feel like I don\u2019t matter to anyone who has been dealing with my case. I am fully aware that the administrative services are always very busy, but if this had happened to me at my worst, I wouldn\u2019t be in College today. In my opinion, these services are there to help students and to make sure they get back to College without delay. I feel the opposite has been true in my case as there clearly has been a complete breakdown in communication between the relevant services. I\u2019ve spent the first semester of my repeat year not knowing where I stood or if I was going to have to pay the full fees. I\u2019ve been threatened with withdrawal more than once by the Academic Registry, for no fault of my own.\u201d\n\nThe student continued: \u201cHaving just received news that I was granted my fees and then to be told I was withdrawn anyway, I am beyond upset. My struggles with anxiety and depression are ongoing and everyone involved knew the reasons for my repetition of the year. I feel the Senior Lecturer\u2019s office had total disregard of this fact and allowed me to slip off their list. It\u2019s very easy to become just a student number to these services. The communication between the offices of the Senior Lecturer and the Academic Registry just seemed to completely shut down with regards to my case which has led me to where I am today; frustrated, upset and withdrawn from my course.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to Trinity News, Education Officer of Trinity College Dublin Students\u2019 Union (TCDSU), Alice MacPherson, said: \u201cIt is not unheard of for student cases to take a number of weeks to resolve, and slow admin is often cited as the cause. This adds huge frustration and stress to already vulnerable students. It would seem this case has gone beyond that and there has been a grave administrative failure and a total breakdown in communications between college offices. This is unacceptable. The student has been in contact and I will be supporting them and working with them to find out what went so wrong here.\u201d\n\nProf. Hutzler said, in correspondence with Trinity News: \u201cFollowing my email to the Academic Registry, it is now being investigated how the various delays and mishaps arose. I have also received an apology for what had happened. What had annoyed me most is that [the student] was put under an enormous stress; being threatened to be made withdrawn, and actually being made withdrawn without one\u2019s fault is bad for any student. It is particularly bad for a student who suffers from anxiety, which was the actual reason why she had to withdraw in 2017 in the first place.\u201d\n\nThe Senior Lecturer, Dr. Martin, did not respond to a request for comment at time of publication. Academic Registry refused to comment on the basis of student confidentiality.\n\nIf you have experienced similar issues with any aspect of Trinity\u2019s administration, we would strongly welcome you to get in contact with us \u2013 please email deputyeditor@trinitynews.ie.

They spoke of an environment in which the drug was handed out at will, without prescriptions or supervision, and revealed the existence of a thriving black market.\n\nVial, which is run by the Greek government and military, is currently home to 2,000 refugees \u2014 from Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and Ethiopia \u2014 many of whom live crowded a dozen people to a tent, in muddy conditions. Many have fled war and abuse to reach Greece. In March, a man set himself on fire.\n\nNatalia Argyrou is a psychologist for Doctors of the World, an NGO that runs health care at Vial for the UN refugee agency, which supports the Greek government in running the camp. Argyrou said that suicides had increased since borders were closed in March 2016, when a deal between Turkey and the EU that would see the refugees return to Turkey came into effect. The Greek government\u2019s Foreign Correspondents Office did not respond to several requests for details details on the number of suicides at the camp.\n\nDoctors say Lyrica should only be prescribed for several weeks at a time, under a doctor\u2019s care, in order to avoid the likelihood of dependence and misuse. The European Medicines Agency says withdrawal symptoms from the drug can give the \u201cimpression of physical dependence, while the the State Medical Chamber of Baden-Wuerttemberg says those symptoms can include tremors, insomnia, severe anxiety, sweating, palpitations and seizures. To handle a possible addiction, it is \"an urgent need to identify addicted refugees and give them psychological and psychiatric support,\" says Roula Michati of Women and Health Alliance International.\n\nDoctors also say the drug should be accompanied by psychotherapy if it is used to treat anxiety disorders.\n\nBut that\u2019s not possible in Vial, according to volunteers and NGO employees at the camp. Doctors of the World has just one psychiatrist and one psychologist working there.\n\nArgyrou told BuzzFeed News that she preferred to avoid talk therapy with the refugees anyway. \u201cWe avoid opening the trauma, because people are here today, tomorrow they are on the move. We can\u2019t have any continuity to what we\u2019re doing,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not ideal.\u201d\n\nSo Argyrou offers breathing exercises to help treat the panic attacks, anxiety disorders and other mental illnesses that plague the refugees who have come here. And she doles out Lyrica. Argyrou says she is aware of the black market in Vial. \"That's why we tried to reduce the distribution,\" she said.\n\nRoula Michati, who worked in refugee camps in Greece, including Vial, from September 2016 to July 2017, said she had also heard of the black market, with 300-milligram pills going for $5 each.\n\nA psychologist who worked on the Greek islands for an NGO until this summer (who asked to remain anonymous to speak freely about a previous employer) said she had seen prescriptions from a local hospital in Chios, where doctors prescribed up to three, 300-milligram tablets a day. Lyrica is approved for a maximum dose of 600 milligrams a day.\n\nOne man working as a translator for an NGO at the camp said that, at times, drug prescriptions were issued on a weekly instead of daily basis, which would also increase the chances of abuse.\n\nThe UN refugee agency, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said it was unaware of any problems with Lyrica.\n\n\u201cWe have no information about the abuse of prescription drugs,\" Boris Cheshirkov, a communications officer at UNHCR, told BuzzFeed News before directing further questions to the Greek government. The Greek health ministry did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\n\nGreek asylum law says the authorities running the camp must ensure access to medical and psychosocial care. Under EU regulations, refugee applicants must \"receive the necessary health care.\"\n\nRefugees describe a more dire situation.\n\n\"This is a medicine for the nerves,\u201d said M., who fled Syria with her daughter and has been living in Vial for months. \u201cThe people here are desperate, they are suffering, and that [Lyrica] is something that makes them feel comfortable and happy. So they can stay here. They must take this medicine, so they can be patient here.\u201d\n\n\"Some people get the pill from the doctor, some from anybody here,\" said T., a former psychology student from Syria who arrived in Vial in the spring of 2017. But the wait for an appointment with the doctor can be long. \"Life here is hard. Some people take the pill. One, then two, three, four.\" T. continues to count on his fingers, all the way up to 10 \u2014 \"This is bad.\u201d He said the medicine helped them relax and switch off for a bit. \"They do not take them as medicine,\u201d he said. \u201cThey take it like drugs.\u201d", "image": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2017-12/8/18/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/refugees-are-not-getting-the-mental-health-help-t-2-17934-1512775263-2_dblbig.jpg", "subject": "anxiety"}, "0884260a0f9b8642fbb3eb5c770e4ce0": {"title": "UN Middle East envoy warns of &#39;risk of violent escalation&#39; after US decision on Jerusalem", "summary": "8 December 2017 \u2013 Wednesday&#39;s decision by United States President Donald Trump recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel has been widely welcomed in Israel but it has also caused much anger among Palestinians and anxiety across the Middle East and beyond, the United Nations envoy on&nbsp;...", "url": "http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=58251", "date": "2017-12-08T16:33:14Z", "text": "Mr. Nickolay Mladenov, Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process and Personal Representative of the Secretary-General, briefs the Security Council from Jerusalem.

All but one landed short, without causing damage or injury.

Although longitudinal clinical and epidemiological studies have documented that approximately all adolescents recover from their first depressive episode, recurrence rates range from 20% to 60% during the first 2 years after remission and rise to 70% after 5 years (Fombonne, Wostear, Cooper, Harrington, & Rutter, 2001; Hale, van der Valk, Akse, & Meeus, 2008). Most adults with recurrent depression have their initial depressive episodes as adolescents. Further, depressive disorders with early onset tend to be more chronic and debilitating than depression beginning in adulthood (Cook, Peterson, & Sheldon, 2009). Therefore, adolescence is considered a critical and optimal time for early detection and adequate treatment of depression (Lopez, Mathers, Ezzati, Jamison, & Murray, 2006). Unfortunately, >70% of adolescents with depressive disorders do not receive appropriate diagnosis and treatment (Bhatia & Bhatia, 2007).\n\nAccording to Thapar et al. (2012), depression can be missed if the primary presenting problems are unexplained physical symptoms, anxiety, eating disorders, refusal to attend school and/or decline in academic performance, substance use or abuse, or conduct problems. In addition, some depressive symptoms, particularly internalizing symptoms, are often viewed as being psychologically and culturally related to female gender and, therefore, lead to gender-biased results when measuring depression (Salokangas, Vaahtera, Pacriev, Sohlman, & Lehtinen, 2002).\n\nMethod Design A nationally representative cross-sectional school survey was used to collect data on individual characteristics and depressive symptoms. Adolescents (ages 12 to 17) who agreed to participate in the study were asked to anonymously complete a self-administered questionnaire. The school-based survey used a passive consenting approach, where parents were informed that a research study is pending and they were required to actively opt out (Courser, Shamblen, Lavrakas, Collins, & Ditterline, 2009). Returning the survey questionnaires was considered a tacit assent for adolescents. The survey was designed based on an earlier feasibility study (Dardas, Silva, Noonan, & Simmons, 2016, 2017), and in collaboration with the Jordanian Ministry of Education. The study obtained Institutional Review Board approvals from both The University of Jordan and Duke University. Measures Adolescent Characteristics Measure. Information was obtained on adolescents' sociodemographic and health characteristics. In particular, dichotomous (male/female or yes/no) responses were gathered regarding adolescents' gender; employment status; health insurance availability; whether the adolescent has any chronic health problem, mental health problem, or a learning difficulty; whether the adolescent had a parent, relative, or friend with mental illness; and whether the adolescent has ever sought psychological treatment. Categorical responses were obtained regarding adolescents' age (12 to 17 years), region of residence (south, north, central), current grade point average (fair to excellent), parents' education (illiteracy to graduate degrees), and family monthly income (<JD150 to >JD1,000). Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). To assess depressive symptoms among Jordanian adolescents, the Arabic version of the BDI-II was used, which has been validated with good sensitivity in differentiating individuals with and without depression (Beck, Steer, & Brown, 1996). The BDI-II comprises 21 items with a total score ranging from 0 to 63. Beck et al. (1996) provided four levels of depression severity based on the total score: (1) minimal, scores from 0 to 13; (2) mild, scores from 14 to 19; (3) moderate, scores from 20 to 28; and (4) severe, scores from 29 to 63. The Arabic version of the BDI-II was tested with Arab university students (Al-Musawi, 2001) and showed high test\u2013retest stability (0.93), high internal consistency (0.92 to 0.94), and high construct validity (0.93). In the current study, the internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) for the 21 items was 0.89. Analysis Plan All data were analyzed using SAS 9.4 software. Descriptive statistics were used to detail the sample characteristics and BDI-II depression measures. To examine gender differences in depressive symptoms, chi-square tests were conducted. The false discovery rate (FDR) procedure was adopted to account for Type 1 error expected due to multiple comparisons. The FDR adjusted p value (or q value) was considered for each test. Phi coefficient statistics (strong [\u22650.5 to \u22641.0]; moderate [\u22650.3 to <0.5]; weak [\u22650.1 to <0.3]) were determined to describe the magnitude of effects. To examine adolescent characteristics associated with depression scores, two multivariable general linear models (GLMs) were conducted for female and male adolescent samples. Based on findings from relevant literature reviews (Dardas, Bailey, et al., 2016; Dardas & Simmons, 2015), adolescent characteristics that were considered for the analyses were age, region of residence, family monthly income, health history, learning difficulties, psychiatric diagnosis, parental educational levels, and family history of mental illness. To determine which characteristics would be included in multivariable GLMs, bivariate GLMs were first conducted to examine the association between each adolescent characteristic and the depression total scores. All nine characteristics were significantly correlated with depression for the female subsample, whereas region, parents' education, and family income were not correlated with depression scores among the male subsample. Next, a multivariable GLM that included the adolescent characteristics that were significantly associated with depression scores was conducted to examine the influence of each characteristic on depression total scores, after adjusting for the effects of other characteristics. Each multivariable GLM was then reduced to a pragmatic model using an iterative backward elimination process by which the least significant covariate was omitted until the model included BDI-II depression severity and only statistically significant characteristics (p \u2264 0.05). The partial eta-squared was determined to address the effect size for each characteristic.\n\nResults Sample Characteristics Table 1 presents the characteristics of the adolescents. A total of 1,389 female adolescents and 950 male adolescents participated in the study. Participants represented all three regions in Jordan, with more participants from regions that have higher population density. The majority of female and male adolescents were 16 years old (25% and 52%, respectively), residing in the central region (42% and 45%, respectively), and reported a family monthly income between JD301 and JD1,000 (i.e., $424 to $1,410 USD) (53% and 56%, respectively). Male adolescents were significantly older than their female counterparts (p < 0.001). Table 1: Sample Characteristics Approximately 14% of female and male adolescents reported having a chronic health problem (e.g., asthma, bronchitis, anemia); 18% of girls and 12% of boys reported having a mental health problem (e.g., anxiety, depression, stress); and 22% of girls and 29% of boys reported having academic difficulties. Girls reported significantly more mental health problems, but less learning difficulties than boys (p < 0.001). Three percent of boys and girls indicated that one of their parents had a mental illness. Finally, 27% of females and 16% of males reported they have sought psychological help (p < 0.001). Sources of help included: family members (50%), friends (15%), religious leaders (11%), school counselors (8%), psychiatrists (5%), and general practitioners (4%). Gender Differences Depressive Symptoms Profile.Table 2 summarizes the severity of the 21 depressive symptoms measured by the BDI-II for female and male adolescents. The most frequently reported moderate or severe symptoms among girls were crying (53%), self-criticalness (40%), changes in sleep pattern (38%), and changes in appetite (28%). The most frequently reported moderate or severe symptoms among boys were crying (44%), changes in sleep pattern (26%), self-criticalness (24%), and loss of interest in sex (22%). Suicidality was the least reported depressive symptoms among female (8%) and male (7%) adolescents. Table 2: Beck Depression Inventory-II: Severity of Depressive Symptoms Table 3 details the BDI-II total scores for female and male adolescents. Among female adolescents, the mean BDI-II total score was 17.9 (SD = 11.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] [17.3, 18.5]), with scores ranging from 0 to 55. Male adolescents had a mean depression score of 13.8 (SD = 10.2, 95% CI [13.2, 14.5]), with scores ranging from 0 to 52. Approximately 41% of female adolescents and 26% of male adolescents reported scores indicating moderate to severe depression. Table 3: Prevalence of Depression among Female and Male Jordanian Adolescents Depression Severity. To examine gender differences in the severity of individual depressive symptoms, chi-square tests were conducted. Figure 1 depicts significant differences in moderate to severe symptom scores. With the exception of punishment and loss of pleasure symptoms, girls had significantly higher scores on all depressive symptoms compared to their male counterparts (all p \u2264 0.05). Comparisons remained significant after calculating FDR p values. Phi coefficient statistics indicated weak to moderate relationships between gender and each depressive symptom. Figure 1. Gender differences in moderate to severe depressive symptoms scores (males: blue bar; females: red bar). To examine adolescent characteristics associated with depression severity among female and male adolescents, multivariable GLMs were conducted. Table 4 provides results from the final models, which included only characteristics significantly associated with depression severity (p \u2264 0.05). The results indicated that among female adolescents, severity of depression total scores was significantly related to the following characteristics: age, family monthly income, mental health problems, and learning difficulties. For this model, \u03b72 = 0.27, indicating that 27% of the variability in the female depression total scores was explained by these four characteristics. Male adolescents' depression scores were significantly related to their age, mental health problems, and learning difficulties, in a model that explained 27% of the variability in depression scores. Gender differences in the severity of depression scores in adolescents ages 12 to 17 were also examined. The findings revealed that gender (F [1, 2308] = 4.6, p = 0.0321) and age (F [1, 2308] = 63.08, p < 0.0001) had significant main effects on depression severity but their interaction was not significant (F [1, 2308] = 2.06, p = 0.1511). Figure 2 depicts the nonsignificant age-by-gender interaction by presenting the adjusted least square means of the outcome (i.e., depression severity) for five gender\u2013age subgroups.

Gender differences in depression severity among Jordanian adolescents exist as early as age 12, with no significant age-by-gender interaction.\n\nDiscussion The symptom profiles of depression in the current Jordanian adolescent sample were generally consistent with those reported in the Western literature. Although there are few reports of individual symptom severity by gender in adolescents, two studies of Western European samples report symptoms as assessed by self-report measures other than the BDI (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale\u2013Children [Olsson & von Knorring, 1997]; Mood and Feelings Questionnaire [Sund, Larsson, & Wichstrom, 2001]). These studies also report sleep pattern changes as frequent symptoms in girls, but attention and concentration symptoms appear more prominent in female adolescents in Western samples (40.4% in Sund et al. [2001] and 48.9% in Olsson & von Knorring [1997], compared to 27% reporting moderate to severe concentration difficulties in the current sample). Attention and concentration symptoms were also more common in Western male adolescents (32.9% in Sund et al. [2001] and 23.8% in Olsson & von Knorring [1997], compared to 19% reporting moderate to severe concentration difficulties in the current sample). Although crying is not often a prevalent depressive symptom among males (Salokangas et al., 2002), including adolescent males (Olsson & von Knorring, 1997), the current study revealed it was the most prevalent symptom among male adolescents. To explain this finding, it is important to understand the screening instrument. The majority of boys scored 3 on the BDI-II crying statement, which reads, \u201cI feel like crying, but I can't.\u201d Thus, it is not that crying is the symptom, but instead is \u201cfeeling like crying.\u201d Therefore, the reported prevalence of crying as a depression symptom among adolescent males in the current sample should be interpreted with caution, as it may be more reflective of gendered expression of sadness rather than frequency or intensity of expression of sadness. Irritability was more often reported than sadness among both genders. This finding was expected as research revealed adolescents are less likely than adults to exhibit melancholic symptoms and more likely to show high levels of irritable and externalized behaviors (Cook et al., 2009). In fact, the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) makes one exception for children and adolescents, whereby irritable rather than depressed mood is allowed as a core diagnostic symptom. In agreement with Benarous, Hassler, Falissard, Consoli, and Cohen (2015) who reported findings from the 2007 European School Survey Project on Alcohol and other Drugs (ESPAD) national European survey, girls were more likely to report irritability than boys. Irritable mood is characterized by excessive reactivity to negative emotional stimuli. Irritable individuals are more likely to be angry or aggressive in response to provocation (Siever, 2008). With that said, it is important that Arab clinicians expect as well as explain to patients and families that depressed female adolescents might exhibit more aggressive behaviors than their male counterparts. Although suicide was the least reported depressive symptom among male and female adolescents, any reported percentage is considered significant and needs to be taken seriously. Suicide, which remains the third leading cause of death among adolescents (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010), is one of the most critical challenges often associated with adolescent depression. Adolescents with multiple high-risk factors should be referred to a child and adolescent psychiatrist, while those with low-risk and protective factors may be treated as outpatients, as they are often less likely to harm themselves (Gould, Greenberg, Velting, & Shaffer, 2003). Future research needs to identify potential risk and protective factors of suicide among Arab adolescents.\n\nGender Differences The current study showed that Arab female adolescents had significantly higher levels of depression than their male counterparts. In addition, girls scored higher on all BDI-II depressive symptoms. This finding is consistent with Salokangas et al. (2002) who compared two screening instruments (i.e., BDI and Depression Scale [DEPS]) among 330 individuals taken from the general population in Finland. Interestingly, Salokangas et al. (2002) found that only one item in the DEPS gave higher scores for females, and that the BDI produced higher depressive scores among non-depressed females than males. They proposed that either the DEPS under-detects or the BDI overestimates depressive symptoms in females. Salokangas et al. (2002) also suggested that using a screening instrument that includes statements connected to gender-bound roles (e.g., sadness and crying) might produce gender-biased findings. To account for these issues, using the BDI-II for initial depression screening in community samples is plausible, as it has high sensitivity in differentiating depressed from non-depressed individuals (Beck et al., 1996). However, Arab clinicians need to use standardized interviews before initiating any intervention, or when assessing treatment responses, to avoid overestimating milder depression or underestimating recovery among females who are depressed. One important difference with the Western literature is that symptom severity was higher for boys and girls in the current sample. Population samples of Western European female adolescents have reflected moderate to severe symptom severity in 3% to 24% of female adolescents (Larsson & Melin, 1990; Olsson & von Knorring, 1997; Sund et al. 2001), as opposed to 41% in the current sample. Likewise, samples of Western European male adolescents have reflected moderate to severe symptom severity in 2% to 8% of male adolescents (Larsson & Melin, 1990; Olsson & von Knorring, 1997), as opposed to 26% in the current sample. According to Harkness et al. (2010), many studies on gender differences in adolescent depression failed to adequately specify what characteristics contribute to depression severity among female and male adolescents. The current study revealed that for female adolescents, depression was higher among those who were older, residing in families with low socioeconomic status, and who had a mental health problem or learning difficulty. Depression scores were also higher among older male adolescents who had a mental health problem or learning difficulty. Each of these models explained 27% of the variability in the depression total scores among female and male adolescents. Future research in the Arab region may need to focus on these characteristics as potential moderators of depression interventions. According to Kraemer, Wilson, Fairburn, and Agras (2002), moderators can specify for whom or under what conditions the intervention works, allowing a more precise description of the relationship between variables. For instance, in the current study, family income only affected female adolescents' depression severity. The relationship between socioeconomic status and depression is not a simple bivariate relationship, as many intervening mechanisms may be accountable. Low socioeconomic status is generally associated with less coping resources, poorer access to health care, poorer physical and mental health, and high stress exposure (Lorant et al., 2007), all of which can have additional effects on depression risk. It is possible that the socially constructed gender differences rather than sex differences predispose females with low socioeconomic status to higher depression risks than their male counterparts. Older female and male adolescents also showed higher levels of depression. The effect of age on onset and prognosis of depression is still unclear. Studies indicate low rates of depression before age 13 (Egger & Angold, 2006). However, these rates begin to rise during early adolescence, followed by a dramatic increase between ages 15 and 18. Up to 25% of adolescents experience at least one major depressive episode by age 18 (WHO, 2005). It is suggested that several biological, psychological, and contextual factors play a mediation effect in this phenomenon (Cook et al., 2009). It is important to note that the current study revealed no significant interaction between adolescents' age and gender on their depression severity scores. Studies have revealed that the change in the sex ratio of depression prevalence often emerges around puberty and tends to greatly increase between ages 15 and 18 (Essau et al., 2000; Essau et al., 2010). However, the current study showed that gender differences were already present by age 12 among Jordanian adolescents. Thus, gendered prevention strategies may need to begin at a younger age to buffer the rise of depression symptoms in girls in adolescence.\n\nClinical and Research Implications Several countries have developed depression guidelines for children and adolescents (Hermens et al., 2015). Keys to these guidelines include: (a) screening; (b) diagnosis; (c) treatment strategies that include psychoeducation, supportive management, and family and school involvement; and (d) monitoring of treatment responses. In the Arab region, there is a significant dearth of mental health staff, including psychiatrists, psychologists, and psychiatric nurses (WHO, 2011). In addition, although the majority of Arab countries have agreed in principle to integrate mental health services into the primary health care system, implementation has been substantially limited (Okasha, Karam, & Okasha, 2012). The large and growing mental health needs of Arab adolescents, along with the substantial lack of mental health resources, require Arab researchers to develop and test realistic and practical approaches to tackling adolescent depression. Two issues are pertinent when discussing cost-effective depression management approaches: (a) prevention versus treatment approaches, and (b) universal versus targeted approaches.\n\nPrevention or Treatment Approaches Using Universal or Targeted Approaches? Because of the high costs associated with pediatric depression, the past 10 years has seen a growing interest in its prevention. The Institute of Medicine (Mrazek & Haggerty, 1994) proposed a three-fold classification of prevention programs on the basis of the populations to whom they are directed: (a) universal preventive interventions, administered to all members of a target population; (b) selective prevention programs, given to subpopulations identified as being at elevated risk; and (c) indicated preventive interventions, provided to individuals who manifest subclinical symptoms. According to the National Research Council (2009), universal prevention strategies are based on the evidence that it is likely to provide some benefit to all, but are often considered costly. However, Horowitz and Garber (2006) found that it is possible for universal programs to be cost-effective if they are able to prevent even a small number of cases of depression at comparatively low cost. On the other hand, selective and indicated prevention strategies might involve more intensive interventions and thus involve greater cost to participants, but because they are delivered to those at risk, potential benefit from participation would be greater (National Research Council, 2009). Overall, selective and indicated programs have shown larger effect sizes than universal programs at short- and long-term follow up (Horowitz & Garber, 2006). However, Spence, Sheffield, and Donovan (2003) reported that major strengths associated with universal interventions include avoiding the stigma of singling out individuals for treatment and relatively low dropout rates. Universal interventions for preventing depression among adolescents have typically been conducted in schools and focused on cognitive and behavioral skills training (Buttigieg et al., 2015; Duong, Cruz, King, Violette, & McCarty, 2016; Merry et al., 2011). Interestingly, in a meta-analysis of 30 studies whose explicitly stated aim was the prevention of depressive symptoms in children and adolescents, Horowitz and Garber (2006) found that none of the studies of universal interventions met the criteria to be considered prevention, and that only three indicated studies showed some evidence of prevention. Horowitz and Garber (2006) argued that there is yet little evidence to support the idea that certain programs can \u201cprevent\u201d depression, and that most of the programs that have been deemed successful \u201cpreventive\u201d programs were in fact successful in reducing, thus \u201ctreating,\u201d depressive symptoms. Overall, more research is needed to establish the validity, reliability, cultural sensitivity, and relative costs and benefits of the different types of depression programs for Arab adolescents. Although it would be premature to recommend abandoning universal programs for addressing depression, selective and indicated programs seem to be promising. As such, identifying adolescents at risk for depression and/or with subsyndromal depression symptoms can be promising for early selective or indicated interventions using low-risk strategies. For instance, characteristics such as low socioeconomic status, history of mental health problems, or a learning difficulty may be used to design selective prevention programs for Jordanian adolescents possessing these characteristics, as they might be at elevated risk for depression. Further, it appeared that gender differences in depression severity among Jordanian adolescents present early in adolescence and thus, prevention programs at a younger age might be more promising for girls identified at risk for depression.\n\nLimitations and Conclusion The current study identified high prevalence of moderate to severe depression among Jordanian female and male adolescents. Significant gender differences and likely social determinants of depression were also identified, which explained approximately 27% of depression variability among Jordanian adolescents. However, the findings should be considered within the context of the study's limitations. The use of the BDI does not provide a true diagnosis of depression, although it is validated with good sensitivity in differentiating individuals with and without depression. The true prevalence may be higher or lower. Second, the cross-sectional nature of the current study provides information about the associations among key variables, but longitudinal studies are needed to determine true predictors of adolescent depression. Finally, given that the survey was school-based, it does not provide information about Jordanian adolescents who are not enrolled in school, although the majority (93%) of youth ages 12 to 17 in Jordan attend school. Despite these limitations, the current study provided valid and reliable data that can be used in promoting a \u201cgender approach to health,\u201d in which Arab researchers and clinicians thoughtfully consider the social, economic, political, and cultural factors when providing care to Arab adolescents at risk for or diagnosed with depression.\n\nReferences Abela, J.R., Stolow, D., Mineka, S., Yao, S., Zhu, X.Z. & Hankin, B.L.

The company, aifred health, is using AI technology to develop a clinical decision aid for physicians to improve the effectiveness of depression treatment.\n\nThe company product is designed as a resource for doctors, and will predict the best treatment \u2013 whether that be a specific medication, psychotherapy, or other possible treatment \u2013 based on an individual patient\u2019s profile, including symptoms, demographics, and biological measures. This type of predictive information will improve the process of finding the best depression treatment, and has the potential to decrease the stress and time spent by millions of patients trying to find a treatment that works for them.\n\nThe start-up was formed in January 2017, and after a year of intense research and product development, members of the project are thrilled at this recognition on the AI world stage. \u201cI am incredibly proud of what our diverse, multidisciplinary team has accomplished in such a short time. We are building something that is truly going to make a difference for patients and their families\u201d, says CEO and Chief Medical Officer of aifred health, Dr. David Benrimoh.\n\nThe company began with a small number of university students but has now expanded to include content advisors from around the world with research expertise in genetics, neuroimaging, AI, psychiatry, and more. Members of the project team come from diverse backgrounds: Computer Science, Neuroscience, and Medicine, forming the powerful coalition needed to tackle one of healthcare\u2019s biggest problems.\n\nDr. Joelle Pineau, an AI researcher at McGill University and head of the new Facebook AI Research lab in Montreal, is impressed by the work being done at aifred health: \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to see that machine learning methods have the potential to help improve treatment outcomes for individuals with depression. This is a complex problem requiring the integration of several types of information. I am excited to see what the aifred team and their collaborators will achieve!\u201d\n\nThe success of aifred health in the past year is indicative of the impact that AI technology will have in the field of healthcare. Montreal has rapidly become a hub for AI development, and the momentum of this city\u2019s AI community only continues to increase. Improving mental health treatment will benefit not only those who suffer from mental illness, but their families, friends, and employers \u2013 as well as overburdened healthcare systems. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 11-20% of people experience depression at some point in their lives, and the success of companies like aifred health provide a source of optimism for many in the quest for better mental healthcare. The students, doctors, researchers, and developers involved with aifred health have entered an exciting new phase, providing better resources for physicians prescribing treatments for depression and better experiences for those being treated for mental illness.\n\nABOUT XPRIZE\n\nXPRIZE, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, is the global leader in designing and implementing innovative competition models to solve the world\u2019s grandest challenges.

Sage stock continued rising on Friday to reach near $170 per share, up 84% from Wednesday's close.\n\nImprovements in symptoms, as measured by a rating scale known as HAM-D, began from the day after the first dose through to week four, two weeks after finishing treatment. The improvements remained greater than placebo through to the end of week six.\n\nAfter two weeks of treatment, 64% of patients were in remission, compared with 23% on placebo. There were no serious or severe adverse events, and discontinuations were low. SAGE-217 has Fast Track designation.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nSage's shares have been up and down this year, rising 10% in February on rumors of a merger, tumbling 20% in September after the failure of brexanolone in epilepsy in Phase 3, and rising again by 50% as brexanolone showed significant improvements in postpartum depression. None of the rises were quite as dramatic as the bump Thursday.\n\nSage was founded in 2011, and the treatment was developed in-house. The company's focus is on next-generation modulators of the GABA system, and the company believes that SAGE-217 has potential to \"offer the first truly new mechanism of action in the pharmacologic treatment of depression in more than 20 years.\"\n\nWhat could give Sage the edge is the speed of onset of symptom relief, the lack of increased risk of suicide and sedation, and the high rate of remission after only two weeks. Existing antidepressants can take weeks to work, which can be very difficult for patients suffering from moderate or severe depression and finding it hard to function. Some are implicated in the increased risk of suicide.\n\n\"These very encouraging data suggest the potential of SAGE-217 in the treatment of MDD as well as other mood-related disorders that we may pursue,\" said Jeff Jonas CEO of Sage Therapeutics. \"The positive activity and safety findings of SAGE-217 in MDD support advancing the program into later stage clinical development and we will work with the FDA to determine next steps in the further development of SAGE-217.\"\n\nThe treatment is also in Phase 2 trials for severe postpartum depression, essential tremor and Parkinson's disease.", "image": "https://www.biopharmadive.com/user_media/cache/44/3b/443b1f7c9c2e87866698fb437e128089.jpg", "subject": "depression"}, "4e63e05093368f665693f61846f6c6a8": {"title": "This Artist Is Using Drone Music to Help People With Anxiety and Depression", "summary": "Jax is candid about her diagnoses: general anxiety, agoraphobia, generalized major depression, and cluster B, a category that includes borderline, narcissistic, histrionic, and antisocial personality disorders. \u201cAccessing mental health care is a nightmare and I just want it to not be such a nightmare for&nbsp;...", "url": "https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/wjgbgm/kristel-jax-uses-drone-music-as-therapy-mental-health-canada-stressweek2017", "date": "2017-12-08T15:00:00Z", "text": "Image: Courtesy Kristel Jax\n\nOn Edge is a series about stress in 2017.\n\nOn a warm, drizzly August weekend in the quiet town of Meaford, Ontario, musicians prepared to take the stage. This past summer marked the twelfth year of Electric Eclectics, a festival celebrating experimental music on a farm two hours outside of Toronto. A short distance away from the main performance area, Kristel Jax administered drone therapy under the sprawling branches of a large tree. To her left, a stark white sheet printed with jagged block letters fluttered in the wind.\n\nDrone therapy is a performance art series that combines deeply personal narratives of mental illness over a backdrop of drone music. Topics of discussion are often guided by the techniques found in clinical therapy workbooks Jax has collected over the years\u2014she has been navigating the mental health care system since she was 16\u2014and her goal is to help people who may be struggling to access an overburdened health care system.\n\nDrone has appeared in traditional folk music around the world for centuries, from the tanpura, an Indian instrument, to Scottish bagpipes. In 1984, musicologist Wilfrid Mellers described ambient musician Terry Riley\u2019s drone music as sustained, minimalistic, and monophonic tones that stretch over long periods of time, inducing a trance in the listener. Music therapy has been shown to be an effective treatment for patients suffering from pain, depression, or anxiety, but it is atypical for music therapists to use experimental music, as Jax is doing.\n\nImage: Kristel Jax\n\nAt Electric Eclectics, Jax asked her participants to sign a waiver\u2014she isn\u2019t a trained clinician, she\u2019s a performance artist. A handful of people joined her to share stories about mental health in the damp grass during her marathon sets, which lasted three houfrs on Saturday and Sunday. She kept her loop pedals dry under a crinkling sheet of plastic.\n\n\u201cDrone therapy is always comedy, and it\u2019s always therapeutic\u2014the way I know a performance is successful is when I\u2019m getting laughs,\u201d she said.\n\n*\n\nThe concept of drone therapy was born in 2015 while Jax was in the middle of a 16-week cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) program at Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), a hospital in downtown Toronto. According to Jax, CBT focuses on helping patients identify the triggers for their anxiety so that they can improve their functionality over time.\n\nEqual parts performance art, whispered confessional, and sage advice, Jax divulges the good, bad, and ugly of the Canadian mental health care system over cascading waves of ambient drone music. It\u2019s a self-care resource in a landscape where few patients can afford therapy\u2014or afford to wait long enough to get it for free. Jax also regularly updates a free, downloadable PDF of health care resources on her website and gathers resources in a binder under her bed.\n\nRead More: 'Side Effects May Include': The Search for an Antidepressant That Works\n\nJax is candid about her diagnoses: general anxiety, agoraphobia, generalized major depression, and cluster B traits (the category can include borderline personality disorder). \u201cAccessing mental health care is a nightmare and I just want it to not be such a nightmare for other people,\u201d Jax told me.\n\nAccording to a January 2017 study in the Canadian Journal of Psychiatry, Canadians face overburdened, aging psychiatrists with rising patient numbers and smaller practices. Doctors are concentrated in urban areas such as Ottawa and Toronto, leaving rural areas underserved.\n\nJax\u2019s work plays with the idea of feminizing a traditionally masculine style of music that was popularized in 1960s Western canon by La Monte Young and The Theatre of Eternal Music. The genre has since experienced a resurgence in popularity, with the advent of national Drone Day in 2014. Founded by Marie LeBlanc Flanagan, the Executive Director of Weird Canada, the holiday encourages improvised group performances across the country, bringing experienced and novice musicians together in a low-pressure environment.\n\nWhen Jax wrote about Drone Day for Vice in 2015, she received numerous internet comments criticizing her work. \u201cA bunch of brones\u2014basically, bros who like drone music\u2014got really mad at me for writing about \u2018their\u2019 music,\u201d laughed Jax. \u201cBut it\u2019s my music too! I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\n*\n\nMusic therapy has been successfully proven to ease the pain of patients receiving postoperative care. It is used to help patients seeking treatment for eating disorders and smoking cessation. A 2004 study in PAIN found that music therapy decreased anxiety in open-heart patients by 72 percent.\n\nHowever, Jax\u2019s project may be unique: When I reached out to CAMH about it, their spokesperson was not aware of anyone else who is adapting formal therapeutic techniques into performance art.\n\nJax\u2019s work has attracted a number of admirers within the experimental scene. Ottawa-based musician and community organizer Elsa Mirzaei first met Jax in 2015 at MEGAPHONO, an Ottawa music festival, where they bonded over their shared work in making arts communities safer. They were reunited this past summer at Electric Eclectics. \u201cWe were droning into the valley, sharing our stories with the environment,\u201d they recalled. \u201cIt was unreal.\u201d\n\n\u201cLiving under white supremacy in Canada, navigating the everyday with a personality disorder\u2014that shit sucks,\u201d explained Mirzaei, who has been diagnosed with PTSD and borderline personality disorder. \u201cThe waiting is too long. People are just gonna get sicker and sicker waiting.\u201d\n\nMirzaei has been registered on a group therapy waiting list for the past year, even opting to be placed into a French program, despite it being their third language. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing really available,\u201d they said. \u201cYou can really only be put on waitlists once you\u2019re almost dead; it took hospitalization for me to be even considered for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy first impression was: \u2018Why are these people talking over the music?\u2019\u201d\n\nDrone therapy is an appealing alternative for individuals who are unable to financially or emotionally commit to a full course of therapy, which can range from 5-20 weeks. Although the efficacy of drone therapy has not been evaluated in a clinical setting, Jax\u2019s friends believe it has been beneficial.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really common for artists to struggle with mental health and substance abuse issues, but it\u2019s not talked about,\u201d explained Mirzaei.\n\nPromoter Joe Strutt has been documenting and recording live music on his blog, Mechanical Forest Sound, since 2009. He first witnessed drone therapy on Drone Day in 2016 at the Music Gallery, an experimental music hub where Jax works as a marketing coordinator. That day, musicians brought armfuls of pedals, keyboards, and circuit boards for a drop-in group performance while Jax invited brave audience members to the mic to share their mental health stories.\n\n\u201cMy first impression was: \u2018Why are these people talking over the music?\u2019\u201d said Strutt. \u201cMy generation is much more likely to tamp down their problems than broadcast everything, but healing works in different ways for different people.\u201d\n\nTom Beedham is a Toronto-based freelance arts and culture writer who helps organize Long Winter, a monthly presentation of music, art, and dance that occurs during Toronto\u2019s darkest months. He\u2019s been a fan of Jax\u2019s online work since before her Music Gallery performance. \u201cShe puts in emotional labour, she\u2019s really forthcoming and very funny,\u201d he said. Her dark sense of humour is starkly contrasted with the severity of the issues being discussed, but Beedham feels that this helps disarm viewers.\n\nJax has no ambitions to become a certified art therapist. \u201cThat's a lot of trust right? To actually claim that you can help somebody and not just be joking around anymore,\u201d she said solemnly.\n\n\u201cThat's a big deal.\u201d\n\nImage: Kate Young\n\nJax is now working on adapting her video series, which she stopped producing in 2016, into a podcast. Each episode will explore a dialectical behavior therapy workbook developed by researcher and DBT founder Marsha M. Linehan. Although CBT and DBT are similar, Jax told me that DBT is geared towards helping patients evaluate their core values and interpersonal relationships with the goal of helping them see their self-worth. \u201cI hope that people who are having trouble accessing help can come along with me for the ride,\u201d smiled Jax.\n\n\u201cThe joke is that I've never turned to drone music for therapy,\u201d laughed Jax, who often listens to lyric-based music like Lana Del Rey for comfort. Jax has been performing experimental noise as Brigitte Bardon\u2019t for the last few years. \u201cDrone music is supposed to be chill, but it makes me anxious sometimes\u2014even the beautiful stuff can be really scary.\u201d\n\n*\n\nDisclaimer: Kristel Jax has written about this author for Broken Pencil Magazine and attended the author\u2019s Inclusive Podcast Workshop series.\n\nCorrection: Jax has been diagnosed with cluster B traits, not with cluster B, as the article initially stated. In addition, Jax's performance at Electric Eclectics wasn't a six-hour set. Rather, it was two three-hour sets, held on Saturday and Sunday.

You\u2019ve lived with the book for about a year now. How did releasing it and documenting your challenges affect your life?\n\nNaomi Judd: The first few months were really difficult. When I went out in public, I felt like everyone was staring at me. Of course they weren\u2019t, but in my imagination I felt very exposed and, as we would say \u2018buck naked,\u2019 because I felt everyone now knew my deep, dark secrets. As many interviews as I have done throughout my career, I had never really exposed a lot of the deepest and darkest secrets before releasing the book. But then my feelings sort of did a flip flop. I can remember exactly when it happened. I was at the carwash way out in the country. An older man in overalls came up to me and got kind of choked up. The guy has probably never cried in his life, but he got choked up and he said \u201cWell, I always liked your singing but I never knew you went through such a hard time,\u201d he said. \u201cI went out and got your damn book.\u201d He just had this look on his face that said that he got it. He told me that the book helped him a lot and that reading it taught him things he had no idea about. So I actually started carrying about 15 paperbacks of the book with me in the trunk of my car so that people who came up to me, whether it was in the grocery or at the dry cleaners, I could hand them one. A short encounter like that is just not enough time to really help someone, I would want to, you know, bring them back to the house and cook them dinner and really listen to them, but I just didn\u2019t have time. But now I can take that moment, go into my trunk, hand them the book and say, \u201cI care about you and that\u2019s part of why I wrote the book.\u201d\n\nMR: After having people come up to you and share with you how much the book has touched their lives, how has that impacted you?\n\nNJ: I have to admit that writing the book was incredibly painful. There were times when I would divulge something and I would have to put it away for awhile. I would need to summon my courage back up to go back and finish writing a section or chapter. Finally, I got to a point, because of the positive feedback, I realized, you know the old saying \u2018the rising tide lifts all boats.\u2019 Well, I was trying to heal others and trying to give them a life raft by saying, \u201cYou\u2019re going to make it. I went through the dark night of the soul too and I\u2019ve made it to the other end. I am recovering and finally healing, and you can too.\u201d\n\nMR: While you were writing and reliving some of these painful experiences, did you have any new realizations?\n\nNJ: Well, you probably have heard people say, \u201cThe worst thing that ever happened to me was actually the best thing that happened to me.\u201d I\u2019m not there yet. This is all still raw to me and I am still working through it, but maybe next year I\u2019ll be able to say that.\n\nMR: You\u2019ve had amazing success in country music and yet look at what you have had to go through and overcome. Were there elements of your career where you felt like you needed to put the brakes on? Was some of that contributing to the anxiety and the depression, even though you were having so much success?\n\nNJ: Absolutely! Thank goodness for my psychiatrist. I was very blessed to meet Dr. Jerrold Rosenbaum, Chief of Psychiatry at Mass General Hospital, the number one hospital in America. When I would hit those spots, I would go talk to him and spend some time in Boston. He has sort of been my detective, helping me go through all those spots. When you\u2019re in the heat of battle, as they say, you can\u2019t really see the big picture. Dr. Rosenbaum helped me see the big picture and understand why I was afraid of certain things that I was still carrying around emotionally that caused panic attacks.\n\nMR: What\u2019s interesting to me is The Judds started at a transitional time in country music, when it was just coming off the Urban Cowboy era. But The Judds were not that Nashvegas kind of act. Did you find it difficult to find footing in the industry during such a time of transition?\n\nNJ: No. You know, Wynonna and I never had money. I never had money to buy LPs and we never had money to go to a concert. We were totally unspoiled in that sense. The only album I ever bought was Bonnie Raitt. With the exception of that, we had no outside influence. When we moved to Nashville, it was during the whole Urban Cowboy scene, and I just hated that. Wynonna and I would sing around the kerosene lamp in our little old, pitiful farmhouse and we really didn\u2019t want anybody to touch our sound. I remember when we signed with RCA Records, Joe Galante, who was the head of the label, in our first meeting, wanted to do a video for \u201cMama He\u2019s Crazy\u201d and I stood up in a room of about 8 men and said \u201cLet me tell you one thing. We\u2019re going to shoot this video at our house. We are going to wear our clothes. My red \u201957 Chevy is going to be in the driveway and that\u2019s the way it is boys. Now we\u2019re going home.\u201d\n\nMR: I remember The Judds being a strong, assertive, and groundbreaking act that shouldered a lot of the evolution that was opening doors for women to have more control of their careers in country music.\n\nNJ: Before entering the business, Wynonna was totally unaffected by pop culture or what was going on in the music scene. We would sit and sing old Appalachian songs that no one had ever heard of. We heard them while living on an isolated mountain top with no television and no telephone. A lot of our music was influenced by the local bluegrass scene. We were so impressed with it. We also got a lot of our sound from just listening to each other.\n\nMR: How did your relationship with your daughter grow as The Judds saw more success?\n\nNJ: Wynonna was very content letting me handle the business side of things. Trying to make her do any of the business stuff was like trying to fit a round peg in a square hole. All she wanted to do was open her mouth and sing.\n\nMR: That could have helped her as an artist. There are certain artists who, if you support them and their work, give you their best art. My feeling is that might have been your daughter. Is that something that you kind of sensed?\n\nNJ: Yes and she is still that way today. I know so many people in country music who are that way. All they want to do is sing and that is just fine.Nancy Jones was that way with George Jones. George is right up there with Wynonna in that category, they were both focused on the music.\n\nMR: You are also the mother to Ashley, who seems totally different from Wynonna.\n\nNJ: Oh, Ashley is the exact opposite. Ashley lives on an adjacent farm and they\u2019re both one minute from each other. She always walks through the backdoor barefoot and all she cares about is what\u2019s for supper or if the weather will be nice enough for her to go for a walk in the woods or University of Kentucky basketball. She is actually there now getting a huge award for her advocacy work. She travels the world going to refugee camps in Syria, Turkey, India and Africa. It is absolutely astounding. I cannot keep up with her. Ashley is the exact opposite from Wynonna. I love them both the same but they could not be more different.\n\nMR: Your family has accomplished tremendous success. Ashley and Wynonna are so talented and here you are, a mother who\u2019s raised two incredible women. All the while, you were right there with Wynonna, guiding her career path in the very beginning and winning all these awards. Yet all this acknowledgement and multi-platinum records and awards couldn\u2019t lift you out of depression?\n\nNJ: You are very kind. I did build a big cabinet I am very proud of and it holds six Grammy awards. I would go into my little office, which is the only place that I allow any symbols of show business, and I would go in there when I was in a dark place and sit in the chair, turn on the light to that cabinet and really reflect. What was going on when I won the Grammy for Best Country Song as a songwriter and all of the other awards of course\u2026 One of the biggest things that helped me get through depression was gratitude. When you are down in such a deep, dark hole, you are just in such exquisite pain and feel like you can\u2019t take another moment, which I hope you never feel. You have to clamor for any shred of light, any semblance of hope that you can. I have so much to be grateful for. I have been married 38 years to my soulmate, Larry Strickland. I have four dogs that also are my children, Wynonna and Ashley choose to live one minute from me. I have so many close friends. I have so many blessings, though I hate that word. It is so overused and corny. But I have so many wonderful things in my life that I am grateful for. Of course, my two biggest are not the show business, or the glitz and glamour of it all. It\u2019s my girls. The fact that they are healthy, happy, we are in touch with each other and they are making their mark. It doesn\u2019t matter what their station is in life but they are self-actualized and that makes me happy.\n\nMR: What does it mean to you to embrace those who are struggling in your own community?\n\nNJ: The Vanderbilt Psychiatric Hospital in Nashville is fabulous. We are so lucky to have it here in this community. I always have people coming up to me talking about the book and I\u2019m excited for the ability to reach so many people at once.\n\nMR: Final question. Naomi, what advice do you have for new artists?\n\nNJ: Don\u2019t ever let anybody tell you who you are. So many people come to Nashville and they listen to what people working at the labels thinks they should be. That will never make them satisfied unless they figure out who they are. Be yourself. Period.\n\n******************************\n\nA Conversation with Walter Afanasieff\n\nMike Ragogna: Walter, you and Mariah Carey co-wrote \"All I Want For Christmas Is You,\" a modern Christmas classic. It's rare to achieve a perennial hit like that. How did that come together?\n\nWalter Afanasieff: Back in the early nineties when Mariah and I first started working\u2014I believe we met in '89\u2014we finished up some work on her first album and then we started working together, collaborating on her next albums and so on. Around that time, Christmas albums weren't what they are today. It's almost like a reverse. When you did a Christmas album back then, it was like your swan song\u2014\"Well I have nothing left to do, here's my Christmas album.\" It's like how today, ending up in a residency in Los Vegas is the biggest deal in the world. Everyone in the world would die for that, but back then, playing in Vegas was kind of like, \"Well, my career's over.\" So doing a Christmas album wasn't in the forefront of everyone's mind as, \"Oh yeah, this is the coolest, greatest thing,\" it just happened to be something that Mariah really loved.\n\nWe were sitting around and said, \"Yeah, that would be a really cool thing to do because nobody really does it at this point in their career.\" So we started writing. We wrote three songs for her Christmas album, and one of them was \"All I Want For Christmas Is You.\" This one was written pretty much faster and quicker and more happenstance than the other two songs because it was really just kind of an old Phil Spector-meets-rock-'n'-roll thing that she wanted to do. I don't know why but I think the feeling was that if you did anything too modern and too contemporary for that day, then it would run its course, it would expire very quickly because songs and production styles change all the time. Every month, there's a new sound and a new thing coming out. We did it in a more formal, old-fashioned rock 'n' roll sense because we thought it would be more timely. There would never be an expiration to that. We know other songs\u2014\"Rockin' Around The Christmas Tree\" and other old songs\u2014are still running strong. So I started playing my little piano riff there, doing my bass line with my left hand and doing my right hand chords, and Mariah started singing the main melody. She didn't have the words yet. We started jamming on it and quickly we had a form, an \u201cA\u201d section, which is the verse, and then I said, \"Okay, now we go to the \u2018B\u2019 section,\" and I tried some chords. She said, \"Yeah, that's cool!\" It all went together, and I said, \"How about a bridge?\" I went into what I thought was an appropriate chord change for a bridge and she liked it. We had this sound come out of us very easily into a melody as well as chord changes and then she got busy with her lyrics.\n\nI remember over the course of a few weeks, she would call me and say, \"What do you think about this lyric?\" It fell into place pretty easily. And this isn't Gone With The Wind, this is a tiny little Christmas song. Christmas rhymes are very easy\u2014\"mistletoe,\" \"tree\u201d\u2014it's all easily rhymed. It came together really fast and nobody knew in our wildest dreams that this song was going to go out and completely stick. It never unstuck. It was always there from the moment it came out.\n\nMR: Why do you think it\u2019s such a classic?\n\nWA: Everyone loves it and I kind of think I know why everyone loves it. Christmas songs are usually in three categories. The first category is always that main, religious, \"Hark The Herald Angels Sing,\" \"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen,\" \"Joy To The World,\" kind; the second category of traditional Christmas songs are all the kids' songs, \"Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer,\" \"Jingle Bells\" and all that. That's fun but you've got those two extremes and you live with them for decades and decades and decades. Then your third category started to come out, I think, around the forties, around World War II and it's \"I'll Be Home For Christmas,\" \"White Christmas,\" more the melancholy, \"I'm not home and I miss you,\" and all of that stuff that's not the most positive stuff about Christmas. That category was what brought us to saying, \"Well, what about a love song? There are really no love songs. Where's your 'All I want is you?'\" She said, \"Yeah, that is kind of cool!\" My thinking is this is one of the few songs that's up-tempo, it's an old style that's never going to go away, and it's a love song. It's about wanting somebody for Christmas. I think anybody can sing it\u2014a kid to a kid or an old person to an old person\u2014we all sing it to each other. It can be completely fun, it can be nonsensical, it can be lovely and heartfelt. It's just a wonderful little message. I'm the luckiest guy in the world that I get to be talking to you about a song that's pretty much the number one Christmas song of all time now and I co-wrote it with Mariah.\n\nphoto courtesy of Walter Afanasieff Walter Afanasieff\n\nMR: When you think of the sheer number of songs ASCAP has under its umbrella, how in the world did it end up at number one?\n\nWA: Whatever the science behind charts is... Over the years, we've had lots of different types of accounting. When you go and count votes for Oscars or Grammys, how they count the numbers or weeks on a chart or years in a row, and before SoundScan, there was straight record sales or a song getting played so many times on the radio. Nowadays from streaming and digital sales and all kinds of stuff including the older methods, well, this song's been around twenty-four years now. Whatever their tallying methods are, lo and behold, we got lucky! I don't know how many people are downloading or streaming or whatever the new digital categories are of the older Christmas songs, but this one got in just in time. And it belongs to a superstar. Who doesn't love Mariah Carey? It got on the front of that train and it's always been there.\n\nMR: What are some of your favorite Christmas songs? And do you know what some of Mariah\u2019s favorites are?\n\nWA: Mariah loved Phil Spector, Ronnie Spector and that whole category of older rock 'n' roll songs, from growing up in the world that she grew up in, which is completely different from my world. I grew up in San Francisco, California, and my family is Russian. We celebrated Christmas completely different from our friends next door to us. We had Russian Christmas. The whole thing about my Christmas was always based on musical quality. I loved the prettier songs. I never really went after Christmas songs. Like I said, I'm older. I'm almost sixty, so my generation sort of went a different way. Mariah went a different way but when we collaborated, it was always in that place that brought out, \"What is your favorite kind of thing? What do you want to sing about? What is your thing?\" For \"All I Want For Christmas Is You,\" I guess we kind of dragged up a very, very huge part of our past. Rock 'n' roll, is a very, very simple yet complicated art. I studied classical music. I threw in some chord changes that are not \"Johnny B. Goode.\u201d There were a few kind of sophisticated chords in that song. I'm kind of proud that I can put that sort of stuff in a very simple rock riff. But my favorites have always been more classical, more symphonic songs.\n\nMR: What kind of training did you have before you started writing a million hit songs for Mariah and others?\n\nWA: I grew up in a house of music. My father was always listening to classical music. I studied classical music. I started playing piano when I was probably like three. I have a very particular...I'm not going to say anything special, but I can't figure out how to do anything but music. It's always been like that. My musical tendencies, my musical abilities were always on a little bit higher level than your regular songwriter. I'm a decent pianist, I've always played jazz and classical, and I started writing from a very, very young age. I can write film scores. I can write Broadway music scores. I can do whatever it takes to write a song or a piece of music. But when that force in me met Mariah\u2019s force, it was wonderful. We have a couple of other songs on her Christmas album. We wrote one of the most beautiful religious songs, \"Jesus Born On This Day.\u201d It's beautiful. We wrote a really lovely, melancholy song called \"Miss You Most At Christmas.\" We went into all directions in the three that we co-wrote and this faster one was the one that stuck.\n\nMR: What about some of your other hits? What was your first break?\n\nWA: I started writing and making music back when people like Kenny G, and Michael Bolton and I were writing songs for Aretha Franklin, Gladys Knight\u2014some of these older, more established artists. A young, new, fresh artist like Mariah Carey that came into our camp back in '89 and '90, that was a pretty cool thing. I was working for a producer named Narada Michael Walden who was producing big hits for Whitney Houston. I was then always playing on these hits that he was producing. I was his keyboardist and arranger, and I started co-producing with him. Eventually, the big break came with Michael Bolton, Kenny G, Mariah Carey, and Celine Dion. She was another brand new artist I produced a song for. And there was Beauty And The Beast! When you do something big or commercially successful, everyone wants to work with you, so I started working with everybody.\n\nWriting a hit song isn't that easy. It's a hard thing because you're up against millions of other songs. Every moment of our lives, a songwriter is writing a song or five. It's a very crowded, complicated marketplace. To get in with a hit song that climbs to a number one position, that's a huge deal. For my years of doing that and being on this record and writing that song and producing that song, I remember I didn't write but I produced \"My Heart Will Go On\" for Celine Dion. That was a giant song. The way people are, not everybody knows who wrote what song, people usually just defer to, \"Oh, he wrote that song.\" Well, I didn't write it but I did produce it. I have a Grammy award for it but it's a very big deal in the press. \"Grammy Award-winner\"... That's a huge deal. So things all fell into place. It's a very hard industry these days because of all of the downloading and streaming and Spotify and all of that stuff. It's really not the same thing. Mariah Carey would sell twenty five million records when she came out with an album. Nowadays, to sell a million records is nearly impossible. There are only one or two people every year that could ever climb to that number. You have to be a Taylor Swift or a Barbra Streisand to do that.\n\nMR: And I don't know about Barbra anymore either. I normally ask this question near the end of an interview but I want to ask now because of what you already introduced. Walter, what advice do you have for new artists?\n\nWA: The thing about new artists is, generally speaking, they'll try to do something that's already been done. That's the thing\u2014when you're writing a song today, chances are everybody in their studios are writing what they want to be a contemporary hit song, writing what the flavor of the month is, what the sound is right now. Everybody will start listening to the Top Ten songs and say, \"Hey let's write a song like that!\" All the songs that I have ever written that became big hits were because I didn't follow the beaten path. I would go off on my own whim. My advice is if you're going to write something, be innovative. Be someone who everyone will want to follow in the footsteps of. Everybody has that in them but they're afraid. A&R people, record companies, everyone has something to say and chances are, they want you to create something that's already been done just so they can do it the easy way. Very few songs will come out that are different sounding but they do come out. Those are the innovators. Those are the anomalies and those are the ones that will get really big, where then people will go, \"Oh, let's do something like that now!\" That's my advice. Really go with your heart. Don't pay attention to business and commerciality and what everyone else is doing. Do something on your own that you think is going to really change the world.\n\nMR: So, ahem, \u201cLet your heart go on?\u201d\n\nWA: [laughs]\n\nMR: Beyond the Christmas songs we spoke about, do you have a favorite song that you've either written or co-written, and do you have a favorite production you\u2019ve done?\n\nWA: I do! My favorite song I've ever written was again with Mariah Carey. It was a song called \"Hero.\" The reason it's my favorite song is because it was an important song and still is. It's used in a very, very particular way to bring out the importance of being who you are and being somebody who can persevere during all the challenges, heartaches, hardships, and tragedies that we're all facing. Almost every day, something horrible comes out in the news and there are so many people who are considered \u201cheroes.\u201d To me, that song represents something that I contributed to a society, one that really stands out because it's about the importance of who you are and how you can be somebody who can change somebody's life and be stronger and just persevere. I think that's an important song and my favorite that I co-wrote with Mariah. My favorite production, I would say, is, \"My Heart Will Go On.\" That song in itself\u2014in the form that it came to me which is just piano and vocal\u2014I made it what you hear, which is full orchestra. I produced and arranged it in a way that I think brought out the majesty and the beauty of something that is so powerful, a never-ending love that somebody has for somebody. Those are my two favorites, production-wise and songwriting-wise.\n\nMR: Beautiful. Most people don't ever have the level of success you\u2019ve had in your life. How do you react to having hits now? Does it thrill or surprise you anymore?\n\nWA: If you think that you're going to follow up or do better or do it again, that can drive you crazy. I don't live my life trying to achieve anything I've already achieved. I think it's great that somebody can go out and get a second Grammy or a second number one or an Academy Award or things like that. But to spend your life trying to chase something you already got completely by accident... You don't get any of those things because you made it so. It's an accident. You have to be blessed and take it for what it's worth. So I do anything that I haven't done already. I do film scores and I try to write a Broadway musical, if I can or write songs that are not meant for Top Forty radio. I think that there are so many international artists that deserve music, so I kind of stay in those fields. I love AC music, I love Josh Groban, Michael Bubl\u00e9, and Andrea Bocelli; I love Barbra Streisand. I produce all of her records now. I think that's more fun because there are no rules and regulations like there are in Top Forty. Like I said, everybody's trying to chase a number one Top Forty radio single but it has to be so particular and so absolutely dripping in copycat-ism, it's almost like paint-by-numbers or cheeseburgers rather than full-on culinary meals. I prefer making whatever I want to make.\n\nMR: I have a seventeen year-old son who listens to Top Forty, speaking of copycat-ism. I have lived through many eras of music in my life\u2014even disco\u2014and I never heard this level of cloning before. If you wanted to have a pop hit right now, how would you do it with any kind of originality or enjoyment?\n\nWA: It's kind of no different than any other big industry. For instance, sports. If you were a number one quarterback for a football team and your time has come... Eli Manning just got put out to pasture, so what is he going to do? Well, if it were me, there are so many other parts to the professional football industry, so many other glamorous, great things to still be able to do. I think that's what I would do. Yeah, my time quarterbacking and doing hit songs during the nineties and 2000s is over. I'm not going to compete with the youngsters. It's pretty much not something I want to continue to do. I'm far too old for it and I don't want to compete with somebody who should be doing it because it's just not my thing. There are so many parts to the music world, so many categories of music and different artists and all international types of music, from television commercials and shows to film scores to Broadway. There's a lot of stuff that I do enjoy doing. Yeah, it's not going to bring in the kind of money that a number one song would. Then again, I don't even know if that's true.\n\nLook at Hamilton. That's probably made more money for Lin-Manuel than any other Broadway musical. This guy is probably close to half-a-billion dollars in income. There's no more money to make for him than a hit Broadway musical. The people trying to write hit Broadway musicals these days are people who can't make it in the traditional recording industry. They're all vying for a piece of that pie now, so now you have a flooded market of people who really shouldn't be writing Broadway musicals but they are because maybe they're famous in some way or did something over here or something over there. Same thing with film scores, there are a million film composers out there and yeah, eventually Hans Zimmer is going to get the prize because he's the most successful film composer. But look at somebody like John Williams, who wrote Star Wars, Jaws, Close Encounters, etc. He's not going out there and trying to compete with Hans Zimmer because his time had already come and gone. He's sort of there but that's not who you go to. You go for the young and cool.\n\nIt's kind of a difficult course to chart but I think if you're smart and have the talent and the perseverance and really believe in yourself, there's always a way to put food on your table. I'm lucky enough that I can tell you that all day long. I have a steady income from just one friggin' song that's the number one song every Christmastime. It's hard world out there! But if you really do think of music the way I thought of music\u2014which is as a science and an art form\u2014you need to study it and learn how to do it and figure out how to play an instrument. You need to know what you're doing, you can't just go out there and know two or three chords. Some of these songwriters don't even know how to play anything, they don't know how to play a single chord, a single musical interval. Computers and autotune and Melodyne--the reason you said it all sounds the same is because the computer is taking their voices and doing something to everyone's voice that makes it a common denominator. Everyone sounds the same because everyone is in perfect tune. Everyone is singing perfectly in pitch and it\u2019s not supposed to be like that. Back in our day, Dionne Warwick, Diana Ross, Madonna, and Mariah Carey never got tuned. Nowadays, everyone goes through the same processing. To me it's still all about the song, all about something that comes out, and you go, \"Wow, what the heck, that's awesome!\"\n\nMR: And so much seems to have gone away.\n\nWA: I think the most important thing that's gone away from our musical, creative society of people who make music is everyone has gone to a technical yet lazy place. I prefer working a few more hours with a singer and having them sing their best rather than going, \"Okay, that's good enough, I'm just going to tune it,\" or, \"I'm just going to comp it in a silly way that's going to save me heaps of time.\" It falls into this McDonald's cheeseburger strategy that, to me, very few people these days would know how to do any other way. That's how they've been taught, that's how they make music. I unfortunately, or fortunately, wasn't taught that way. I make music the old-fashioned way. If you can do it, let's do it until it's right. I don't care how much time it takes.\n\nMR: What's on your bucket list?\n\nWA: My thing is to keep going on as a composer and hopefully get some film scores. I'd like to see the rest of my life doing that, that would make me the happiest guy in the world. Working on my academy, my film score music and kind of just seeing what Christmas time brings next year and the years after.\n\nASCAP\u2019S TOP CHRISTMAS SONGS\n\n\"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" by Mariah Carey and Walter Afanasieff (1994) \"A Holly Jolly Christmas\" by Johnny Marks (1962) \"Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow\" by Sammy Cahn and Jule Styne(1945) \"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\" by Johnny Marks (1958) \"Last Christmas\" by George Michael (1984) \"Jingle Bell Rock\" by Joseph Carleton Beal and James Ross Boothe(1957) \"It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year\" by Edward Pola and George Wyle (1963) \"It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas\" by Meredith Willson (1951) \"Sleigh Ride\" by Leroy Anderson and Mitchell Parish (1951) \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" by Johnny Marks (1949) \"White Christmas\" by Irving Berlin (1941) \"Winter Wonderland\" by Felix Bernard and Richard B.

The catalyst [to record] was our new Strawbs member Dave Bainbridge who has been with us for two years.\n\nMR: What was the writing and arrangement process like?\n\nDC: This goes back over two years when I first met keyboard player Dave Bainbridge who was recommended to me by the guitarist with Carl Palmer's ELP band. I went to Dave's studio in the wilds of Lincolnshire, 250 miles from where I live, to try out a new song \u201cThe Ferryman's Curse.\u201d We worked together so well that I knew Dave was right for the band. Unfortunately, shortly afterwards, I became ill and was in and out of the hospital for over a year. The recording possibilities were put on the back burner. We were booked to do RosFest in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, rehearsed up Hero And Heroine, and did a series of US shows despite the fact that I was in recovery. It was in May [of] this year that the preparation for a new album took place. Firstly, Chas Cronk and I got together in May 2017, with two acoustic guitars, to run new ideas through. I had a notebook full of song jottings and lyrics. We took them to Dave Bainbridge's studio to put down acoustic demos to a click track.\n\nMR: What did producer Chris Tsangarides bring to this Strawbs project?\n\nDC: Chris heard the demos and immediately knew the songs had a current lyrical twist to add to our \u201cGothic\u201d sensibility.\n\nMR: Did all this differ from how you would create your earlier albums?\n\nDC: In the 1970s, we would rehearse the songs before going into the studio but then, we had an unlimited budget. The last couple of albums have been recorded as acoustic demos to a click track. The difference this time is that Dave Bainbridge added his contributions before I went back to his studio to edit the songs. They were sent to Chris Tsangarides for the studio recording.\n\nphoto credit: Michael Parent Dave Cousins\n\nMR: Dave, in the very first song, \u201cThe Nails From The Hands Of Christ,\u201d a young woman seems obsessed with Jesus who, in her case, looks like Bruce Springsteen. She buys a pile of rusty nails from some barker. In some respects, this song could be\u2014excuse the pun\u2014a cousin to \u201cThe Man Who Called Himself Jesus,\u201d perhaps some millenniums-later sequel.\n\nDC: I had a title\u2014\u201cThe Nails From The Hands Of Christ\u201d\u2014from a newspaper report about two archaeologists who claimed to have found the actual nails. I wrote a few cynical verses that formed the basis of the song. \u201cThe Man Who Called Himself Jesus\u201d asks the question, \u201cHow would people recognize Jesus if he returned as he promised?\u201d This new song is written 40 years later and young people in the UK are not regular church goers.\n\nMR: Would you fill us in on a couple of songs? In the gentle song \u201cThe Song Of Infinite Sadness,\u201d you reference Babylon and Heaven. What was going on in that one?\n\nDC: The song was written during a cruise down the Nile. In particular, it refers to the Temple of Abu Simbel. The twin temples are the two lovers torn apart.\n\nMR: There\u2019s \u201cWhen The Spirit Moves,\u201d the title track\u2026we could go on with even more spiritual references that are peppered throughout the album. In my opinion, they add to the case that sonically and often lyrically, beyond simply being \u201cprog rock,\u201d Strawbs might have created a whole other genre that could be labeled \u201cCathedral Rock.\u201d\n\nDC: I am affected by the atmosphere of ancient churches and cathedrals. I live opposite a Norman church built in 1135. They have a spiritual aura and ambiance that I find uplifting.\n\nMR: By the way, I\u2019m also thinking of \u201cGrace Darling\u201d and \u201cGhosts,\u201d two more examples of that kind of work.\n\nDC: I was fascinated by \u201cGrace Darling\u201d from an entry in my children\u2019s encyclopedia. \u201cGhosts\u201d\u2019s was inspired by the \u201cSoldiers and Sailors Monument\u201d in Indianapolis. To the best of my knowledge, only two songs have been written about that monument\u2014one was \u201cGhosts,\u201d the other was \u201cStardust\u201d by Hoagy Charmichael, who looked up at the night sky from a caf\u00e9 in the circle.\n\nMR: I\u2019ve always admired Strawbs\u2019 approach to choral background use and arrangements. How would you define or at least hint at what Strawbs music has been over the decades?\n\nDC: Strawbs has never deliberately taken on a new style for the sake of it. We continually evolve.\n\nMR: Where most prog bands write with sci-fi or supernatural themes, Strawbs chooses the divine through man, heavily mixing folk instrumentation or at least melodies with its rock. Were you ever concerned that emphasis might have, over the years, prevented more commercial success or did that even matter, your focusing instead on artistic elements?\n\nDC: The songs are to a great extent biographical. If you want to know about what has happened in my life, it's all in the songs. Our audience identified with the songs, to the extent of getting married to one or other of them, from finding consolation at times of sickness and bereavement. We tried to record a hit single for the USA but did not strike lucky. I get my satisfaction from those who have told me that they have been comforted by my songs.\n\nMR: You have a devoted fan base that practically borders on \u201creverent.\u201d Considering album releases and tours aren\u2019t particularly frequent, what do you think explains that level of respect for Strawbs both from fans and critics?\n\nDC: The fact that our audience identifies with the lyrical and spiritual content of the songs. Not that I preach a Christian viewpoint. These songs are deeply personal.\n\nMR: What seems extraordinary about \u201cThe Familiarity Of Lovers\u201d is that the music says more about the topic than the lyrics that only serve as a skeleton or perhaps the song\u2019s forward or premise. How do you write songs these days and is that a goal of your writing or a happy coincidence?\n\nDC: The lyrics are biographical. Chas Cronk had a chord sequence that I recognized as fitting a sketch of lyrics. Dave Bainbridge came up with a mellotron line that best suited the atmosphere. I came up with the hook guitar line on acoustic guitar which Dave Bainbridge played on electric guitar. Chris Tsangarides said it reminded him of \u201cSummer Breeze\u201d by The Isley Brothers. I had the idea of having a twin lead guitar section in the style of \u201cHotel California.\u201d That guitar section took a week to record. Dave Lambert and Dave Bainbridge took two hours!\n\nMR: Your positive \u201cWhen The Spirit Moves\u201d almost seems timely, my interpretation being it suggests that when we\u2019re together, there\u2019s strength and unity, a power that might be esoteric but can be practical.\n\nDC: The basis of the lyrics were written when I saw the John Paul 11 pass by in the Popemobile in Prague. We locked eyes as I was calling out 'Il Papa' from the side of the street. I was profoundly moved. I saw him again twice, a couple of months later, when I was visiting Rome. Some years before, I had a reply from a letter I wrote to him. Monsignor Rey wrote back to grant me the Pope's abundant blessings.\n\nMR: What\u2019s the story behind \u201cThe Ten Commandments\u201d?\n\nDC: That song was written and sung by Dave Lambert. To my mind it complements \u201cThe Nails From The Hands Of Christ,\u201d which is the reaction of young people to the established church. It also counters \u201cWhen The Spirit Moves,\u201d which expresses hope.\n\nMR: \u201cThe Ferryman\u2019s Curse\u201d\u2014the title track\u2014is related to your earlier song, \u201cThe Vision Of The Lady Of The Lake\u201d from the early Strawbs album Dragonfly. What is its thematic connection to the earlier song and has it been gestating a long time, finally birthed for this album?\n\nDC: The earlier song saw the boatman tempted by lust in the apparition of a young, desirable maiden. The song was based on the seven deadly sins and in the finality, he was crushed. Many years later, he is living a quiet life on the banks of the river when the ferryman arrives to avenge his young daughter who perished.\n\nMR: Speaking of gestating, The Ferryman\u2019s Curse album is the group\u2019s first album in 8 years. Why did it take so long for its release?\n\nDC: Largely because I have been in and out of the hospital for two years. Also because we had not found the right keyboard player to match the ambitions of the songs. In Dave Bainbridge, we have.\n\nphoto credit: Rod Green Strawbs\n\nMR: My personal favorite Strawbs albums are Ghosts, Hero And Heroine, Grave New World and Bursting At The Seams. Do you have favorites and which are they?\n\nDC: I believe that this new album has the measure of any of our previous albums. We have had the greatest line-up of keyboard players any band ever\u2014Rick Wakeman, Blue Weaver, John Hawken, Don Airey, Adam Wakeman, Oliver Wakeman, and Dave Bainbridge.\n\nMR: Strawbs recorded the album Deep Cuts with Rupert Holmes and Jeffrey Lesser on board. In my opinion, they were a brilliant team that did marvelous work on Rupert\u2019s Widescreen album but I find it was a curious choice for a Strawbs album. How did this arrangement come about?\n\nDC: Through our then record company [Oyster Records]. Rupert was the creative element, Jeffrey was the hugely talented, if secretive, engineer.\n\nMR: David, what advice do you have for new artists? (please elaborate, it\u2019s a nice gesture for the kids)\n\nDC: Do as many live shows as you can. Do not cut and paste songs on a computer. Songs must be organic.\n\nMR: If you were to sum up The Ferryman\u2019s Curse's message, what would that be?\n\nDC: There is hope but you have to dig deep to find it.\n\nMR: One last question. What magic did you use to make your voice sound exactly as it did over 40 years ago?\n\nDC: I think it sounds better! Don't smoke. Keep listening to others and compare them with yourself. Don't use auto tune or you'll sound like everybody else.\n\n********************\n\nDREE MON\u2019S \u201cREBEL SOUL\u201d EXCLUSIVE/PREMIERE\n\nphoto credit: Deuce Janisch Dree Mon\n\nAccording to Dree Mon...\n\n\u201c\u2018Rebel Soul\u2019 was a song written about letting go of the ideas that things have to be done only one way. I've always been a rebellious and proud non-conformist and sometimes it's gotten me into trouble and made me feel like there was something wrong with me for not wanting to do things like I was told. Now I embrace that quality and I encourage other people to embrace it as well. I wrote \u2018Rebel Soul\u2019 at a time when I didn't know if continuing as an artist was feasible for me and in that sense pushing thru and continuing to create music and let it represent me as an artist, and all that comes with it, is my current Rebellion. Giving up would be easy, doing something more realistic would be logical. But luckily I'm too much of a dreamer. It was serendipitous as well that I met producer Cameron Tyler who spent lots of laughs and time with me in the studio vibe-ing and listening to music we both dug. The track for \u2018Rebel Soul\u2019 was already in his arsenal and when he sent it to me to see if I was inspired by it, it clicked right away. I wrote that song in a Ralph's parking lot in my parked car, ideas flowing, music blaring, old ladies staring.

It\u2019s now integrated into the university\u2019s suite of training and development programs offered through Human Resources \u2014 more than 500 university employees have participated in the workshop over the last 18 months.

Three months after attending a workshop, 70 per cent of program participants report using a skill they learned in the Working Mind to help either themselves or someone else. The Working Mind program was co-authored by Andrew Szeto and Keith Dobson, two University of Calgary academics.

He\u2019s killing them!\u201d\u2019\u201d according to the evaluation performed by Mark Cunningham, a Seattle-based clinical and forensic psychologist.\n\nCunningham said his report, which gives a window into how the defense may organize its case, was based on more than 12 hours of interviews with Christian during four separate occasions.\n\nThe report gives the most detailed information to date about how Christian views the MAX train attacks.\n\nWhile he did not give a formal diagnosis, Cunningham found that Christian \u201cexhibits reactions consistent with posttraumatic stress disorder\u201d and appears to have self-medicated his anxiety with substance abuse. Christian also exhibits signs of obsessive-compulsive disorder and behavior on a \u201csocialization disorder spectrum,\u201d Cunningham found.\n\nMultnomah County Judge Cheryl Albrecht, who is presiding over the case, unsealed Christian\u2019s mental health evaluation Friday. The report was submitted by his defense attorneys as part of their argument to release Christian on bail, which Albrecht denied last month.\n\nThe findings depict a man who failed to meet the expected roles of most adults, as well as someone who is obsessively passionate about free speech, especially when it is provocative.\n\nFailure To Becoming An Adult\n\nChristian was born in May 1982. He\u2019s the third of four boys. And since 2010, he\u2019s lived at his parents\u2019 house with his brothers and extended family, the report states.\n\n\u201cThough 35 years old, he has never had his own apartment or lived independently,\u201d Cunningham wrote. Christian\u2019s never married or had a serious romantic relationship and told Cunningham he \u201cdid not want to date.\u201d\n\nChristian withdrew from high school as a freshman and was home schooled for one-year. He received his GED when he was 16 years-old, according to the mental health evaluation.\n\nChristian\u2019s longest stretch of employment was at a pizza restaurant, where he worked from ages 16 to 20. Other employment stints have lasted weeks, the report states.\n\nChristian has also spent considerable portions of his life behind bars. When he was 20 years-old, Christian was convicted of armed robbery.\n\nIn his psychological evaluation, Cunningham wrote that the robbery itself demonstrates Christian\u2019s \u201csocial dysfluency.\u201d\n\nChristian robbed a convenience store where he was well-known while wearing an \u201cinadequate disguise,\u201d Cunningham said.\n\nChristian spent eight years behind bars for the robbery, much of it in solitary confinement, the report states.\n\n\u201cMr. Christian recalled feeling suicidal in solitary, considering ripping the veins in his wrists with his teeth,\u201d Cunningham wrote.\n\nChristian was released from prison in 2010. Since then, he\u2019s been in and out of prison and jail on a variety of weapons charges.\n\nComic Books And Moving To South America\n\nChristian reportedly owned about 15,000 comic books stacked in his parents\u2019 living room and his bedroom, and had an \u201cencyclopedic knowledge\u201d of them, according to the report.\n\n\u201cMuch of his time has been organized in this pursuit,\u201d Cunningham said. \u201cHe described frequenting Goodwill and garage sales for high demand paperback books, which he would sell on Amazon. With the proceeds, he bought comic books.\u201d\n\nThe day before the stabbings and his arrest, Christian\u2019s mother allegedly called a family meeting. She told her sons that they needed to remove their belongings from her home, the report states.\n\nShe offered to pay for the first two months of a storage facility. But Christian protested.\n\n\u201cThis announcement is viewed as a significant stressor for Mr. Christian,\u201d the report states. \u201cThe hording is a defense against anxiety. The prospect of losing this insulation between the hoarder and the dangers of the world produces significant distress and even panic.\u201d\n\nCunningham also interviewed one of Christian\u2019s friends for the report. The friend described Christian as a \u201c\u2018big kid\u2019 \u2014 still focused on \u2018comic books and super-heroes.\u2019\u201d\n\nChristian told Cunningham he had plans to move to Brazil with proceeds from selling comic books once he saved up $10,000.\n\n\u201cWith this money, he would immigrate to Brazil and live among an aboriginal tribe on the Amazon,\u201d the report states. \u201cHe exhibited no insight regarding the practical impediments of this plan.\u201d\n\nChristian\u2019s alternative plan was to move to Argentina, because the country lacks copyright laws.\n\n\u201cThis would allow him to print comic book images on T-shirts, products which would then be sold worldwide in countries not having intellectual property protection laws,\u201d Cunningham wrote in the report. \u201cThe logistics of this seemed to be an irrelevant detail.\u201d\n\nThe Attack\n\nDuring the attack on the MAX train, Christian said he was \u201cbuzzed,\u201d having consumed 20 ounces of sangria earlier that afternoon, the report states.\n\nChristian said his intent the day of the attack, according to the report, was \u201cto do \u2018his free speech thing\u2019 on the MAX.\u201d\n\nCunningham said Christian \u201clacks insight into the degree of reaction his verbal provocations may stir in others.\u201d\n\nProsecutors said Christian boarded the train on the eve of Ramadan and shouted racial slurs at two African-American girls, one who was wearing a hijab.\n\nIn the report, Cunningham said the girls didn\u2019t cross Christian\u2019s mind.\n\n\u201cHe recalled that they were on their headphones and cellphones,\u201d the report states. \u201cHe reported that he did not speak to them or direct any of his remarks specifically to them. Mr. Christian recalled that the girls were 15 feet away and moved at some point.\u201d\n\nIn testimony during Christian\u2019s bail hearing, police said people on the lightrail train began to intervene.\n\nCunningham writes as people got physically close to Christian, it reminded him of his time in prison.\n\n\u201cHe recalled this vulnerability as \u2018feeling like prison,\u2019 describing that prison is the only context where he has had to fight multiple assailants \u2014 detailing a number of instances where this had occurred,\u201d the report states. \u201cMr. Christian recalled thinking he needed to \u2018take care of business\u2019 as rapidly as possible to keep from being beaten by a group.\u201d\n\nThe report also states that Christian denied having any white supremacist beliefs, which several people have accused him of because of the slurs he used. He was also seen at an April rally in Southeast Portland using Nazi salutes.\n\n\u201cNotably absent from Mr. Christian\u2019s fervent espousal of beliefs and opinions was any semblance of assertions of \u2018white supremacy,\u2019\u201d Cunningham wrote in the report.\n\nA hearing to discussing scheduling in the case is set for Dec. 15.", "image": "https://www.opb.org/images/upload/c_fill,h_300,q_90,w_400/2017-06-07T181908Z_885241154_RC159034B130_RTRMADP_3_OREGON-STABBING_dnezpn.jpg", "subject": "mental health"}, "a6f6d80f4a0a935517f08643bcf70008": {"title": "North Delta family creates &#39;Camo Friday&#39; campaign to raise mental health awareness", "summary": "After 15-year-old Mitchell Slater took his own life in May, his family needed a way to remember him.

But even just you, yourself,\u201d Slater said. \u201cJust knowing if there\u2019s something not right that maybe you should speak out, and it\u2019s okay to speak out.\u201d\n\nThe idea of wearing camouflage to spread awareness didn\u2019t come right away.\n\nIt started with the camo baseball caps the family handed out at Mitchell\u2019s funeral. The family would wear them, and send pictures to each other over Snapchat and Instagram.\n\n\u201cThen, this one day I decided to myself \u2026 I\u2019m at least going to wear camo on Friday,\u201d Slater said. \u201cIf that\u2019s the only day I can wear it, I\u2019m going to make sure I can wear camo on Friday.\u201d\n\nShe sent a photo to her boyfriend, with the caption \u201cCamo Friday.\u201d He sent one back with the same caption.\n\n\u201cLater I said, \u2018Why did you wear camo?\u2019,\u201d Slater said. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018Because I decided I\u2019m going to wear camo every Friday.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt became a hashtag within the family, and soon spread to social media.\n\nSo far, the campaign has seen a positive response. Slater said schools and sports programs are wanting to participate, and many people are now sharing their own stories with the family.\n\n\u201cEverybody know somebody,\u201d Slater said.\n\n\u201cOr them, themselves.\u201d\n\nThe Camo Friday idea \u201cwas something that just kind of mushroomed,\u201d Dobin said. \u201cIt took a life of its own. It wasn\u2019t something that was planned and organized.\u201d\n\nSoon, the family hopes to start a foundation in Mitchell\u2019s name, bringing in their Camo Friday campaign to continue to spread awareness.\n\n\u201cIt has just fallen together in hopes that someone else can be helped,\u201d Dobin said. \u201cThat people are aware that there [are] struggles and sufferings out there.\u201d\n\nIf you or someone you know is considering suicide, there are places to go for help:\n\n\n\ngrace.kennedy@northdeltareporter.com\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter", "image": "https://www.surreynowleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/9647695_web1_171207-NDR-CameoForMitchell_1.jpg", "subject": "mental health"}, "61c4bbad0aeb04af1224215aef692521": {"title": "US prisoner gouged out eyes after jail denied mental health care, lawsuit says", "summary": "\u201cI hope that things will change, not just for people with mental disorders, but for the people in disciplinary,\u201d Partridge said by phone, explaining how solitary confinement and other punishments exacerbated his mental illness. \u201cGetting tased and beaten, all that is stressful.

Officials also ignored a judge\u2019s emergency order to get Partridge psychiatric treatment, leaving him alone in his cell where he \u201cplucked out his own eyeballs\u201d, the suit said.\n\nHis case appears to be a particularly gruesome example of the way Americans with mental illness struggle to get help, and can end up in jails and prisons that punish them with cruel treatment and refuse to provide medical services.\n\n\u201cI hope that things will change, not just for people with mental disorders, but for the people in disciplinary,\u201d Partridge said by phone, explaining how solitary confinement and other punishments exacerbated his mental illness. \u201cGetting tased and beaten, all that is stressful.

What can be worse than that is the delusion that arises in isolation Ryan Partridge\n\nPartridge began suffering from schizophrenia in his late 20s, and his parents were repeatedly forced to call the police due to violent outbursts, the suit said. The Boulder native was in and out of jail for minor offenses related to mental illness \u2013 all misdemeanors, such as loitering, trespassing and mischief \u2013 and at one point, he was homeless, Lane said.\n\nJail records show that Partridge was experiencing psychosis in early 2016 when he reported that he was going to gouge out his eyes and banged his head into a toilet, leaving him bloodied and with broken teeth, according to the lawsuit.\n\nAlthough Partridge told a mental-health worker that he had suicidal thoughts and officials were aware of his psychosis, deputies repeatedly responded to him with violence, the suit said. One deputy allegedly punched and tased him and sent him to a \u201csecure disciplinary cell\u201d in March of 2016.\n\nAlthough a judge ordered that he should be sent to a state mental hospital, Partridge remained at the jail and was again punched and tased when he ignored orders, according to the complaint. When two deputies later saw Partridge attempting to gouge out his eyes, they put him in a \u201crestraint chair\u201d, placed a \u201cspit sock\u201d over his head and tased him, the suit said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ryan Partridge with his mother Shelley five years ago. Photograph: Courtesy of family\n\nAfter a brief stay at a community hospital, he was sent back to jail, where he was suffering from increasingly intense paranoia.\n\nOn 1 November 2016, during a psychotic episode, Partridge attempted suicide by climbing to the top of a second-floor railing in the jail and jumping head first to the ground, smashing his head on a table and cement floor and suffering broken vertebra, the suit said. He tried to jump again from the same railing a month later before guards stopped him.\n\nOne deputy began mockingly referring to him as \u201cParachute Partridge\u201d, the suit said.\n\nDespite the suicide attempts and injuries, a mental health worker and a sergeant concluded he was \u201cnot a risk to himself and that the jump was merely an attention-seeking behavior\u201d, his lawyers wrote.\n\nPartridge said in an interview that spending so much time alone, unable to talk to his parents or attorneys, was deeply harmful to his mental state: \u201cIt\u2019s just very difficult psychologically \u2026 That led to more delusional thinking.\u201d\n\nAs his mental health deteriorated toward \u201csevere insanity\u201d, the jail ignored a court\u2019s emergency order and his parents\u2019 pleas to hospitalize him, the lawsuit said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll never forget the feeling of literally knowing my son is being abused and tortured and I can\u2019t do anything to stop it,\u201d his father Richard Partridge said by phone.\n\nHe ultimately gouged his eyes out with his fingers in December, and when deputies discovered him in his cell with his eyes swollen shut and blood on his hands, they proceeded to try and handcuff him before slamming him to the ground and tasing him, the suit alleged. Eventually, he was taken to a hospital and released from jail.\n\nCommander Mike Wagner of the Boulder sheriff\u2019s office said the department can\u2019t comment on pending litigation or an inmate\u2019s health, but said some of the claims were false, adding in a statement, \u201cWe are aware of the very difficult circumstances surrounding Mr Partridge\u2019s time in-custody at the Boulder County jail. Our mental health professionals, deputies, and staff faced very difficult situations involving Mr Partridge, and went above and beyond in trying to assist him during his time in-custody.\u201d\n\nBritain\u2019s prison suicide crisis: \u2018There\u2019s no political will.

The damage to his eyes, however, was so severe that no surgery could bring his vision back, according to doctors.\n\nHe said he is slowly adjusting to blindness: \u201cIt\u2019s a different form of solitude.

Jones, 47, who was born and raised on the island and owned the taxi firm Amber Cabs Co., was found dead in the duplex she shared with her adult daughter.\n\nHer son was arrested that day, then released from police custody and apprehended under the Mental Health Act.\n\nUnder Section 28, a police officer may apprehend and immediately take a person to a doctor for examination if the officer is satisfied the person is a danger to himself or others and is apparently a person with a mental disorder.\n\nA doctor is then responsible for determining whether a person should remain under the care of a medical professional or be released from hospital, said RCMP spokeswoman Cpl.

She was dependable, reliable, a soft-spoken and gentle kind of person. I think the residents felt quite comfortable with her.\u201d\n\nJones allowed customers to carry an account so they didn\u2019t have to have exact change and would invite people to book in advance so they would make it on time to a doctor\u2019s appointment, O\u2019Brien said.\n\nWhen the news came about her death, people were stunned by it, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a small island. Everybody knows everybody. The people here probably had more of a friendly relationship with her.\u201d\n\nThe 43 residents are stoic \u2014 they\u2019ve seen it all, O\u2019Brien said. Still, some find it hard to believe Jones has died under suspicious circumstances.\n\nJones is one of four sisters, said O\u2019Brien, who recalled seeing her working at Country Grocer.\n\nDr. Richard Crow, Island Health\u2019s executive medical director of population and community health, said in a statement: \u201cDue to patient confidentiality, we cannot discuss anything about this case.

Dartmouth, as a community, is being deeply affected by the crisis.\n\nWe\u2019ve heard about these issues in our constituencies first-hand from patients and their families, health-care professionals, doctors, emergency room staff, clinic administrators, and the list could go on.\n\nMost recently, we heard our constituents\u2019 concerns reflected back in the auditor general\u2019s report. The report pointed out that the Dartmouth General is the only regional hospital in the province without a crisis response service and with no psychiatry support to the emergency department.\n\nRecently, Health Minister Randy Delorey was pressed by the media about the health-care crisis, and about the lack of available resources for those in mental health crises. His response is that there are always emergency services available for Nova Scotians by calling 911.\n\nSo, what happened to the 1,400 people who went or were brought to the Dartmouth General emergency room last year with mental health issues? They waited to be transferred to the QEII for a mental health assessment. Unfortunately, these transfers only happen when beds are available, and so patients in mental distress in the Dartmouth area could end up waiting for hours or even days before possibly leaving the hospital without any treatment at all. In our minds, this is a crisis.\n\nOur hospital serves 120,000 people, one in four of whom lives in a low-income household. We know that people in the lowest income bracket in Canada are three to four times more likely to report fair-to-poor mental health. And yet, our local hospital is missing the most basic mental health services available in other communities.\n\nOur community is staring down a family doctor shortage that is only set to worsen with more Dartmouth doctors planning to retire. In the next five years, Dartmouth will lose over 40 per cent of its family doctors, and the attrition has already begun. Every day, we hear from residents who have lost a family doctor, or who can\u2019t find one in the first place. Primary care providers like family physicians and nurse practitioners are the first line of care for mental health conditions and illnesses. People without access often end up in crisis situations because they couldn\u2019t get support early on, and after a crisis, these same individuals are often left without follow-up support.\n\nThe auditor general was right in pointing out that where you live shouldn\u2019t determine the quality of treatment you receive. We need a government that is willing to recognize the crisis we\u2019re facing and to work collaboratively with patients, families, and health-care professionals to find solutions. If we don\u2019t act soon, it could be too late for the people in our community who need help the most.

The study, Elevated Urinary CRELD2 is Associated with Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-mediated Kidney Disease, was published online in the journal JCI Insight, December 7, 2017.\n\nThe ER is the central site for folding, posttranslational modifications and transport of secretory and membrane proteins. When there is a mismatch between the load of unfolded/misfolded proteins and the folding capacity, \u201cER stress\u201d occurs. If ER stress is prolonged or is too severe, cell suicide can be triggered, usually in the form of apoptosis.\n\nER stress contributes to the pathogenesis of various human kidney diseases such as congenital nephrotic syndrome, familial focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, Alport syndrome and ischemic acute kidney injury (AKI). The development of ER stress biomarkers that detect the very beginning stages of ER stress-mediated kidney disease, even before a kidney biopsy is clinically indicated, would allow for early therapeutic intervention.\n\nDr. Chen\u2019s team, including Yeawon Kim, MS and Sun-Ji Park, PhD, has pioneered the development of urinary ER stress biomarkers. MANF (mesencephalic astrocyte\u2013derived neurotrophic factor) was the first ER stress biomarker they discovered in mouse models (click here to read their paper published in 2016 in JASN). Now, they are the first to report that CRELD2 (cysteine-rich with EGF-like domains 2), a newly identified protein that is induced and secreted under ER stress, is a sensitive urinary biomarker for ER stress in certain murine models of ER stress\u2013induced nephrotic syndrome and AKI.\n\nMore importantly, through the collaboration with different disease consortiums, they demonstrated that the CRELD2 biomarker has potential use in human disease. In samples from their Wake Forest Cohort, an increase in urinary CRELD2 occurs in patients with autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (ADTKD) due to mutations in the UMOD gene encoding uromodulin, a prototypical tubular ER stress disease. In addition, in pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery who were enrolled in NIH-funded TRIBE-AKI consortium, urine CRELD2 levels were detectable within 6 hours after surgery and were strongly associated with severe post-surgery AKI.\n\nThe availability of CRELD2 as a biomarker has broad clinical applications for patients. The biomarker will serve in early diagnosis, risk stratification, treatment response monitoring, and directing of ER-targeted therapies in a select subgroup of patients in the emerging era of precision nephrology.\n\n\u201cER stress has emerged as a signaling platform underlying the pathogenesis of various kidney diseases and targeting ER stress will provide novel mechanistic treatments,\u201d says first author Yeawon Kim. \u201cI feel very excited about our discovery, which may facilitate early diagnosis and risk prediction and ultimately change the treatment paradigm.\u201d\n\nDr. Chen and Yeawon Kim, through the Office of Technology Management at Washington University, have a patent application on the technology using CRELD2 as a novel urine biomarker of ER-stress kidney disease.\n\nThe study has also been featured in ASN in the Loop.\n\nThe full article can be read here.", "image": "https://renal.wustl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/feature_maggie.jpg", "subject": "stress"}, "78be3d16c34d9eb2e2096c34ab507b1f": {"title": "Stress Is No Joke: An Expert Explains How It Affects Your Physical Fitness", "summary": "Have you ever dragged yourself to the gym after a particularly stressful day and you just can&#39;t bring yourself to finish that treadmill session?

It can feel impossible to get a good workout in when you're not feeling 100 percent. That's because stress has a serious effect on the body, and it can mess with your fitness in ways you might not expect.\n\nPOPSUGAR spoke to Liz Letchford, MS, ATC, EMT, personal trainer and exercise specialist, who explained that there are two kinds of stressors that affect the central nervous system. Positive stressors, like working toward a goal or completing a tough workout, have \"a training effect\" on the body, so you're building yourself up to get stronger and face future situations. However, negative stressors, like facing pressure-filled deadlines or dealing with toxic relationships, can stimulate your \"sympathetically dominated central nervous system (fight-or-flight mode).\"\n\n\"If you submit your body to workout stress on top of your life stress, your body will eventually not be able to keep up, and you risk adrenal fatigue.\"\n\n\"When you work out, whether it's cardio or weightlifting, your body's nervous system is being taxed,\" Liz said. \"The more often you exercise, the easier the body is eventually able to achieve dominance by the parasympathetic (rest and digest) nervous system.\"\n\nBut it's a bit of a different story when you're stressed. \"When you are dealing with stress or anxiety, that nervous system is being double taxed, and it won't be able to perform well,\" she said. \"If you have ever tried to workout when sleep-deprived or very stressed, you'll know what I mean. Everything feels heavier, more difficult.\" Yep, it sure does.\n\n\"If movement helps you de-stress, choose workouts that are nowhere near maximal effort.\"\n\nUnfortunately, you can't just power through a workout and expect it to be helpful when you're battling stress. \"If you submit your body to workout stress on top of your life stress, your body will eventually not be able to keep up, and you risk adrenal fatigue,\" Liz warned. \"Adrenal fatigue has the ability to undo all of your efforts in the gym, making you feel lethargic and unable to perform at a high level as well as making you gain weight.\"\n\nOK, so maybe skip the gym session next time you're stressed AF. According to Liz, your body's nervous system is giving its full attention to whatever is currently causing you stress, so \"it isn't functioning optimally to help you maintain your balance or activate the appropriate stabilizing muscles that protect you from injury.\" You won't be able to lift as heavy or run as fast as you normally do, and if you tried to do your normal routine, \"the system couldn't handle it and you risk muscle strain or worse.\"\n\n\n\nThe 1 Thing I Gave Up in My Diet to Finally Ease My Anxiety Symptoms Related\n\nIf you feel the pressure of the world beating down on you, for goodness sake, Liz recommends you rest. Just rest. \"If movement helps you de-stress, choose workouts that are nowhere near maximal effort,\" she suggested. \"Go on a walk, take a slow, meditative yoga class, stretch, or participate in a [release] class.\"\n\nNo matter what you choose, make sure it's something that will alleviate stress, not exacerbate the already existing stress that's sitting on your shoulders \u2014 and in your nervous system.", "image": "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/9yFwwJarFw2AFnw37mR5pHZeZkk/fit-in/1200x630/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-:fill-!white!-/2017/12/08/862/n/1922729/069490945a2aeaede18d87.25109048_edit_img_facebook_post_image_file_44346767_1512761395.jpg", "subject": "stress"}, "a2ab20a64cc79d015221b5d3f4bcf413": {"title": "Hospital lab sniffs out stress, prescribes &#39;unconditional love&#39;", "summary": "He loves yoga, squeaky toys and long romps in the woods, but the newest employee at the IWK Health Centre in Halifax has a special place in his heart for kids.

Well, animals experience their own forms of that, too. And researchers are worried about how narwhals, the so-called unicorns of the sea, will deal with the stress that\u2019ll accompany the loss of sea ice in their habitats. According to one new study, probably not well.\n\n\n\nThe fact that climate change is melting Arctic sea ice is no secret. The extent of sea ice throughout the Arctic Ocean, where the narwhals call home, is dramatically diminishing, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. The average sea ice extent year round between 1981 and 2010 was roughly 1 million square kilometers larger than it was this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith less ice around, more ships will enter Arctic waters. Already, in waters along the Milne Inlet in Canada, shipping traffic just about tripled between 2015 and 2016. This analysis found narwhals swam faster when a large vessel approached. Now, a new study has found narwhal heart rates decrease when they\u2019re stressed. That\u2019s bad news if they\u2019re fleeing stressful situations, like a huge loud ship approaching.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d\n\nThe study, published in Science Thursday, shows that narwhal heart rate appears to hit a major freeze as the animal flees from danger. That\u2019s dangerous for the cetacean, because its muscles need more oxygen when working to help the animal run away quickly. With their hearts beating as slowly as three beats per minute, narwhals aren\u2019t receiving enough oxygen to make up for the speed.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d Greg Breed, an ecologist at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks who wasn\u2019t involved with the study told Science Magazine.\n\nThe research team discovered this by using an attachable device that monitors heart rates on nine narwhals in 2014 and 2015, after releasing them from nets they got entangled in during indigenous hunts. Terrie Williams, an ecophysiologist from the University of California, Santa Cruz, had developed this technology while researching dolphins. It worked for narwhals, too, but would fall off after three days max.\n\nStill, in the short time the devices were attached, the researchers noticed something funny about the narwhals\u2019 escape response. They got stressed and sped away, but, as mentioned above, their bodies didn\u2019t respond in a way to accommodate their increased speed. Their hearts slowed down.\n\nThe team still doesn\u2019t know how the narwhals will respond to the particular stress of increased sea traffic and noise as their historically secluded homes become marine highways, or what chronic stress can do to the extraordinary animal long term. Other creatures\u2014like lab mice, and even humans\u2014have been found to experience cardiac arrest due to chronic stress.\n\nWith about 175,000 narwhals estimated to exist worldwide, let\u2019s hope they\u2019re better at handling stress than we are.", "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--kVync3Hk--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/upivukdvas5cjh5ljiaq.jpg", "subject": "stress"}, "3d25181fa2530057f558ca7b356fac5e": {"title": "Stress Takes a Toll on Health", "summary": "Anyone involved in agriculture knows it&#39;s a stressful business.

Farmers and ranchers are at the mercy of Mother Nature, fluctuating commodity prices, unforgiving schedules, financial uncertainty, and a host of other factors that are out of their control.\n\nThat stress can be severely damaging to both mental and physical health. According to a recent study of 130 occupations by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, laborers and farm owners have the highest death rate from stress-related causes like heart and artery disease, hypertension, ulcers, and nervous disorders. Excessive stress can also make it difficult to focus, which can lead to accidents in these dangerous industries.\n\nThe most frightening statistic, however, comes from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: 90 out of every 100,000 farmers commit suicide. That is six times higher than the national average.\n\n\u201cFarmers know how to take care of their animals and crops, taking careful steps to ensure that they are healthy and safe. Unfortunately, some farmers don\u2019t take the same care in monitoring and managing their own mental and physical stress and fatigue,\u201d says Suzanne Pish, a Michigan State University Extension educator specializing in social-emotional health. \u201cStress becomes especially palpable when commodity prices are low, and caring for your own health and wellness in this high-stress profession is as important as caring for your bottom line.\u201d\n\nFinding Help\n\nLaborers and farm owners have the highest death rate from stress-related causes. Michigan State University Extension has designed a free online course aimed at helping farmers and their families recognize chronic stress and finding ways to improve it. \u201cWeathering the Storm: How to Handle Stress on the Farm\u201d is broken into four sections with step-by-step instructions, interactive activities, photos, surveys, and audio and video components. The entire course takes one to two hours to complete, and it can be done all at once or in smaller increments. Find the course and other resources for managing stress at msue.msu.edu/managingfarmstress.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping this new digital format makes it easier for farmers and their families to access these helpful tools and to learn to cope with the ever-changing business of farming,\u201d Pish says.\n\nThe experts at MSU also recommend farmers cultivate a more positive mindset, which can help increase productivity and resiliency. Three tactics can help.\n\nSelf-talk. Tell yourself you can adapt and overcome any challenge. Remind yourself you\u2019ve faced hard times before and you can do it again. Choose three words to help maintain your mind-set, such as calm, capable, and controlled. Breathing. Practice deep breathing to calm your mind and to help you focus. Breathe deeply five times and exhale slowly. This also can help improve sleep and can help with chronic pain. Acceptance. If things are out of your control, it may be best to just accept them and focus on finding a solution instead of getting frustrated by the problem.\n\nExercise is another way to help reduce stress. According to MSU, a brisk, 10-minute walk can reduce the brain\u2019s level of the stress hormone cortisol by 50% to 70%.\n\nMind the Children\n\nWhile hard times on the farm are stressful for adults, children are also affected. \u201cFarm children are unique in that they are often much more involved in the everyday business affairs of their families than the children raised in other settings,\u201d Pish says. \u201cConsequently, it\u2019s very obvious to them when the farm is in trouble.\u201d\n\nFarm kids suffering from stress may have trouble with schoolwork, difficulty sleeping or concentrating, or stomachaches. Pish says maintaining farm routines and rituals can provide children with a sense of security. She recommends reminding them that nobody is perfect, encouraging physical exercise and healthy eating, and helping ensure kids get enough sleep. She also suggests removing nonpriority items from the calendar to make more time for family activities and hobbies.\n\nIt\u2019s important to laugh with kids, too. \u201cHumor helps ease almost any situation,\u201d Pish says. \u201cIf everyday stresses are overwhelming your family or children, make sure to get them help from a health care provider.\u201d\n\nLearn more\n\nSave these phone numbers and website addresses and don\u2019t hesitate to use them if you or someone you love is struggling.

There are only about 450 of the whales left in the world, and entanglement is now the leading cause of death for them.\n\nWhat happens to many whales after entanglement has been something of a mystery. Now, stress hormones found in the whales\u2019 feces may be providing some clues.\n\nA new study in the journal Endangered Species Research looked at 125 whales over 15 years, and shows that those that remain tangled in fishing gear for long periods of time \u2014 months, or even years \u2014 have extremely high levels of the stress hormones in their poop.\n\nMaine Things Considered Host Nora Flaherty interviewed Elizabeth Burgess, a marine biologist at the Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life at the New England Aquarium, who says those hormone levels aren\u2019t just bad for individual whales, they\u2019re bad for the population as a whole.\n\nBurgess: This study is the result of 15 years of work, and throughout that time we\u2019ve been able to establish a baseline of what a normal healthy whale looks like and what that profile for cortisol, the stress response comes out as in the feces. What we\u2019re doing is kind of like using feces instead of blood, because blood is very difficult to collect from the whales \u2014 we\u2019re getting an indicator of the internal health of the whale. While whales can occasionally be seen entangled, and we know that there\u2019s physical damage, by having a look at the stress profile in the feces, what we\u2019re getting at is what\u2019s happening inside the body, so a whole-animal response. What we\u2019re seeing with entangled whales that are chronically entangled for, on average, six months, is we\u2019re getting sky-high levels of cortisol as a stress response. These are orders of magnitude, so they\u2019re not minor elevations, and this is quite different to what we see in a whale that has been struck by a ship. Those whales tend to die very quickly, and so the cortisol levels in the feces that we see in those animals actually match what we see in a normal whale. That is because that stress response hasn\u2019t had time to get through to the feces.\n\nFlaherty: Obviously swimming around for a long time entangled with fishing gear presents its own dangers, infection and so forth. But the stress it creates also has some fairly profound effects, correct?\n\nYes, absolutely. By seeing these these sky-high hormone levels, we\u2019re seeing that these animals are suffering terribly. It\u2019s not just the external physical trauma that we can see visibly, or when we see a dead whale washed ashore, but there is a very strong internal response. It really speaks to the welfare of these animals.\n\nDo these high stress hormone levels have effects on things like breeding?\n\nAbsolutely. A heavily mounted stress response is going to impact body condition and energy reserves of these animals, so we start to see emaciation in the population, and then further down the track it really affects reproduction. For females, they tend to breed less, which is going to further impact the population because if we\u2019re not getting new calves into the population, then we\u2019re not going to see that population growth. This year we\u2019ve had 17 deaths of North Atlantic right whales and only five calves born. These heavy impacts on the population are really not sustainable.\n\nNorth Atlantic right whales have been protected for more than 40 years. But unlike some other large whale species they\u2019ve not really bounced back. Why is that?\n\nThese whales travel along the entire Eastern Seaboard \u2014 really very urban habitats \u2014 so management for this species, they have quite a high interaction with human impacts from shipping and entanglements. This year particularly, entanglements has been quite a big issue because what we\u2019ve seen is a shift in their distribution. With warming waters in the Gulf of Maine \u2014 the Gulf of Maine has actually had an unprecedented increase in water temperature \u2014 that\u2019s affected the food source of this whale. So the whales are moving farther north and potentially farther offshore, and they\u2019re encountering new areas that previously may not have had strong management protocols in place. That\u2019s that\u2019s why we think we\u2019re seeing quite high incidences of entanglements this year.\n\nHow few whales do you get down to before the population becomes not viable?\n\nThat\u2019s a really great question, and we don\u2019t really know. But currently, at less than 450 and with a projected trajectory of decline, we\u2019re really getting into very scary territory of losing this species. Some modeling papers are predicting that we probably have 20 years left at this current rate of decline. We really are in a very dire situation.\n\nWhat does your research suggest in terms of steps to protect the whales, and how confident are you that those will be taken?\n\nThis study is really important because it raises awareness of the suffering that these animals are going through. But it also helps us establish information about what we can expect to see in this population. From this study we\u2019re getting very important information about the very chronic levels of stress in a right whale, and we can use this information to help monitor those living whales and try and highlight early warning signs of impacts in the population before we start to see these mortalities. If we\u2019re able to get an early warning sign of seeing a strong stress response across the population, then we can use that to really engage a management practice or a management change. At the moment what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re really engaging with the fishing gear, we\u2019re having open conversations about some solutions that we can come up with so that we can continue fishing, but that we\u2019re not entangling right whales and we\u2019re not further endangering the population. These are ongoing discussions both at the government level and with industry and the fishermen that are out there.\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity.", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/mpbn/files/styles/medium/public/201712/38916954961_f4fde259cb_k.jpg", "subject": "stress"}, "cd20a593da8360c0ddd32e0167a6bb0e": {"title": "Say Goodbye to Stress and Hello to Bliss With These Pleasure-Inducing Sex Positions", "summary": "Sex is a fantastic stress reliever, considering orgasms cause the body to produce feel-good hormones like endorphins, dopamine, and oxytocin.

Nobody was ready to shift ground so the meeting was deadlocked.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter our meeting with the two factions, we sent our report to FIBA. There has been no communication yet so we are waiting to hear from them.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlthough the Kida camp is vehemently opposed to another election, the Umar faction has said the only available option left now is fresh election to be conducted.\n\n\n\nSpeaking to SHOT!, the spokesman of the Umar camp, Patrick Omorodion said since one of the options given by FIBA which is amicable resolution of the crisis has failed, the only option left is fresh election.\n\n\n\n\u201cEverything is self explanatory. FIBA had given two options which was for the crisis to be resolved amicably or a fresh election to be conducted.\n\n\n\n\u201cFrom what has happened, one of the options has failed so we are left with only one which is fresh election. We are ready for another election.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe do not know the content of the report that NOC has sent to FIBA but we are not bothered. They (NOC) are biased in their actions so we are waiting to hear from FIBA,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile as the basketball fraternity in Nigeria continues to wait on FIBA for a decision on the crisis, a former chieftain of the defunct National Sports Commission, Malam Abba Yola has said the way forward is for a fresh election to be conducted.\n\n\n\nHe said it will be the only way out of the crisis since FIBA had already said it did not recognise either the election in Kano or Abuja.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy candid opinion is that since the two parties have failed to agree, the only way forward is for the NOC to recommend to the ministry that a fresh election should be held.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf that is not done, maybe it is FIBA that will order for fresh election, that is if it decides not to apply sanctions against Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\u201cPersonally I think this is just the way out of the crisis. The better candidate will re-contest and win fair and square and it will be the end of this unfortunate situation,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nSpeaking in the same vein, a former director of sports in Katsina State, Alhaji Aliyu Kofar-Soro said to the best of his knowledge there was no election so ordering for a fresh election won\u2019t be a bad decision.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll I know is that there was no acceptable election anywhere, whether in Abuja or Kano but everybody is laying claim to victory.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe right thing is to conduct a fresh election in a free and fair manner. Once that is done, the winner will be more acceptable to the stakeholders.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo I am fully in support of a fresh election so that we settle the matter once and for all,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nFrom the foregoing, the crisis in the NBBF is festering with no solution in sight as the two factions have refused to settle their differences amicably.\n\n\n\nAs it is said in local parlance, FIBA now holds the knife and the yam and it is expected to come up with a decision that would be in the best interest of Nigerian basketball.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the waiting game continues as nobody can say exactly when FIBA would respond to the report sent to it by the NOC.\n\n\n\n", "image": "https://images.dailytrust.com.ng/cms/gall_content/2017/12/2017_12$large_Anxiety_as_basketball_waits_for_FIBA_verdict.jpg", "subject": "anxiety"}, "66eced33aad40f4f3bd69ce1f8968dd5": {"title": "&#39;Dark web&#39; drugs led to death of socially anxious Durham University student, 19, from", "summary": "A BRIGHT student plagued by social anxiety died in her flat at Durham University after taking a drugs overdose, an inquest heard.

Starting his career transcribing music for the legendary Frank Zappa, Vai achieved mastery of guitar through years of practice under the very best \u2013 Joe Satriani. With a career spanning over 40 years, Vai has collaborated with David Lee Roth, Alcatrazz, Whitesnake, Zakk Wylde, Yngwie Malmsteen, Nuno Bettencourt, Tosin Abasi, The Aristocrats, and been a part of the Satriani-headed G3 Live Guitar tour.As guitar lovers are in for treat tonight, News18.com interviewed Vai about his first-ever visit to India, experience interacting with Indian fans, the changing music scenario, the demon of depression and more. Excerpts:We performed at the NH7 on October 28th in Shillong, and it was a fantastic event for us. The audience was just amazing -- so supportive -- so I\u2019m very happy that I decided to do this show that\u2019s coming up in Pune.It\u2019s not been very long that Western rock acts have been going to India so the audiences are still very excited. I would assume the audience will be as crazy as it was for our show in Shillong in October.It\u2019s always nice to be recognized for your contributions, and I never take for granted the great support and success I have had.I just love the guitar... always have... and between the guitar and the specific kind of music I make, I have always found great fulfillment in it. The monikers, awards, etc. are consequences of my passion for the instrument and my music. I think it\u2019s like that for any artist who puts their personal creativity before anything else.There was a time when I started to gain some recognition that I felt pressure to deliver music that would blow people away and keep them coming, but after a while I saw that as something that was getting in the way. I was putting too much pressure on myself to be great. But the funny thing is, some people may resonate with what an artist does and think they are just the best, while many others just don\u2019t get it and will go as far as to troll on the internet and let everyone know what they think.What I discovered was everyone has some kind of uniquely creative ability and if you can find that and throw yourself into it fully, the proper audience will come to you -- the audiences that are moved by what you do. It\u2019s a win-win situation because the artist is being themselves and the audience they attracted loves that. If you try to second guess your audience or reach for an audience that is not on the same playground as you, chances are it will be a fail-fail situation.My creative motivation comes from the same place that it does in anybody else, and where that is, I don\u2019t know, but when it shows up in us it takes the form of \u201ca good idea.\u201d Once you are compelled by an exciting creative idea, there\u2019s no need for motivation. It just happens.I can\u2019t remember when I started music because the interest in it seemed to always just be there, but I started my professional career when I was 18 years old. I was transcribing music for Frank Zappa and when I was 20 years old, I joined his band for three years.Passion is the momentum of excitement. If a person can find in themselves an exciting creative idea, and if they can hold that excitement and only choose thoughts that are goal-oriented, then the excitement builds and eventually turns into a passion, and then they become absorbed in what they are doing. When you are absorbed in the passion of what you are doing there is never the thought to stop.I do take breaks but they are more like family vacations, and I enjoy those as much, if not more, than playing music. The idea of taking a break from music just never occurred to me.I\u2019m more comfortable in my skin now. After so many years of performing you start to relax more and more and the more I started to relax the more comfortable things became. You play better, and move better with more elegance. In my younger days, I was perhaps a little more active on stage. My natural way of moving, including all the odd faces that I make, is something that feels natural to me. There was a time when I was concerned that I just looked weird performing, but then after a while you just surrender to what\u2019s natural to you and that\u2019s when the good stuff starts happening.I think it\u2019s relative. There are many commercial artists that are true artists in their essence. They would not last otherwise. Many people feel that if an artist is very popular on the pop music scene, it means that they are not true artists. I don\u2019t agree. I think that what Katy Perry, Bruno Mars and many other famous pop stars are very artistic. If they are not they just won\u2019t last at the top. But even if you're not at the top, you can be very artistic.One of the great things about music is that there\u2019s something out there for everyone. It\u2019s the diversity that makes it so great.The way to cure your own depression is to realize what\u2019s causing it. The thoughts in your head about yourself and the world are the only things that cause depression. The thoughts a person chooses to think have a corresponding emotional feeling in the body, but a person must be able to see the quality of the thought they are thinking. Most thoughts are repetitive, based on past or future and usually negative and have some level of fear in them, but people believe that they are their thoughts so if they are thinking negatively, they will feel bad.The cure is to first see the quality of the thoughts in your head. Most people live with a little voice in their head that is continually talking to them. It criticizes everything including itself. It\u2019s usually complaining, or looking for something to fulfill it. It takes a harsh look at the world and it blames others and separates people. It\u2019s called the ego and it\u2019s probably talking to you all day long.This is the cause of depression. In order to get out of it you have to see the thoughts from a non-critical, non-judgmental silent witnessing presence in yourself. Once you can see the negativity in your own beliefs, it can be a surprise to realize that you have been kept slave to this little voice. Watching your thoughts is also called \u201cMindfulness\u201d and is a Buddhist tradition, but anyone can do it.The less you listen to, believe and obey the little voice in your head, the freer you are. That\u2019s when something else can arise in you and that\u2019s peace and joy. Peace and joy are your natural states of being. It\u2019s at the core of who you really are. Now if you read that and are criticizing it, that\u2019s the ego.Many people believe that they need to have things a certain way before they can be happy, but what they don\u2019t understand is the thoughts they believe are creating their perspective on the events in their life and the world in general. Most people, especially young musicians, can feel that... once they\u2019ve \u201cmade it,\u201d once they\u2019ve sold a million records, have a lot of money in the bank, have won first place in all the awards, have a Grammy Award, are adored and on the cover of all the magazines...that then they will be able to be happy and at peace.But many artists that may have had all those things can come to the realization that that\u2019s not it. Wordly success can be nice but it\u2019s not the thing that\u2019s going to bring a person a sense of deep satisfaction, peace, stillness and joy. As a matter of fact, it can make things much worse for a person.Some people can reach very high levels of fame and realize that they brought their miserable selves with them and that even though they have a lot of success, they still have this deep sense of inadequacy, fear, and unworthiness. This reeks havoc in their mind and hearts because they are looking for something that you just can\u2019t find in the world. When you take a drink of alcohol or drugs, your mind can not move so fast so it can\u2019t fixate on all the normal negative thoughts that are usually in the head, so being drunk or high can actually bring some people relief from the tormenter in their head, but unfortunately it\u2019s not the answer either because you are just turning a blind eye to the problem and once you are sober again, you are confronted with the old unhappy self. For some people this suffering can be unbearable and they start entertaining thoughts of oblivion (suicide) for relief.I have done a lot of soul searching along with thousands of hours of mediation. I don\u2019t believe I\u2019m an expert on truth or spirituality. I\u2019m a work-in-progress like all of us. But there are a few things I\u2019ve discovered as a knowing inside me. One is that we are not separate from the Universe, and another is\u2026all is well and there is nothing to fear. Those two simple realizations, if understood and embraced, can bring a great sense of peace.", "image": "http://img01.ibnlive.in/ibnlive/uploads/2017/12/Steve-Vai-e1512807385812.jpg", "subject": "depression"}, "4aba4c0420a1937074c9b0be85822c31": {"title": "Abbott promise on postpartum depression goes unmet", "summary": "Gov.

Greg Abbott agreed with lawmakers this year on a move that could encourage more Texas mothers to get checked for postpartum depression. For a second time, though, Abbott\u2019s 2013 campaign call to spend money qualifying low-income mothers for a year\u2019s worth of mental health screenings and services after giving birth didn\u2019t pass into law.\n\nLast year, we had marked this Abbott campaign promise Stalled on the Abbott-O-Meter, where we track progress on the governor\u2019s major promises.\n\nThe 2015 Legislature had done little more than taken testimony on a proposal to expand mental health screenings and treatment. After another legislative session, we decided to take a fresh look to see if the campaign promise is any closer to becoming reality.\n\nAs a candidate, Abbott framed his case for expanding insurance coverage of treatment for postpartum depression in his campaign\u2019s compendium of promises \u2014 and by mentioning the 2001 drownings of five Texas children by their mother.\n\nAbbott wrote in 2013: \u201cIf left untreated, symptoms of postpartum depression may last for months or years, jeopardizing the health and safety of the mother and her child. In 2001. Clear Lake mother Andrea Yates drowned her five children while suffering from a rare disorder called postpartum psychosis. In the aftermath of this tragedy, lawmakers passed a bill requiring health care providers who provide prenatal care to a pregnant woman to give her a list of resources that provide postpartum counseling and assistance to parents. The Yates case, and laws passed in its aftermath, raised awareness of postpartum depression, but more needs to be done to ensure new moms have access to screening and care.\u201d\n\nAbbott wrote: \u201cLawmakers should also consider expanding benefits under CHIP Perinatal and Medicaid for Pregnant Women to cover screening, diagnosis and treatment for postpartum depression.\u201d As a starting point, Abbott said, such coverage for mothers should be expanded from the existing 60 days after giving birth to up to a year.\n\nThe Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program offers low-cost health coverage to poor, working families. Medicaid, the federal-state insurance program, benefits lower-income residents.\n\nAbbott said that with the expansion he was urging, a \u201cwoman who reports having symptoms of postpartum depression to her postnatal care provider will be screened for postpartum depression and may be referred to a mental health care provider that accepts Medicaid for diagnosis and treatment.\u201d A state study had established the cost of establishing such a program to be $3 million in 2016-17.\n\nIn updating progress on this promise, we spotted no decisions in the 2017 legislative session to make women who give birth under CHIP eligible for mental health screenings and treatments more than 60 days after delivery. Some other actions still could benefit mothers going forward.\n\nAn October 2016 report requested by lawmakers stated that in a recent year, the share of Texas mothers on Medicaid diagnosed with postpartum depression or other mental health challenges after giving birth considerably trailed national averages.\n\nA few months earlier, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission had launched Healthy Texas Women, a program generally open to low-income women who are legal U.S. residents ages 18 through 44 and who lack insurance coverage for family planning services. Commission spokeswoman Kelli Weldon told us that provisions were made to automatically enroll women in Healthy Texas Women 60 days after a Medicaid-covered birth.\n\nSuch mothers, Weldon said, would remain eligible for mental health screenings and treatment. \u201cOffice visits for diagnostic evaluation, and basic follow-up and monitoring of treatment response, are covered,\u201d Weldon said. \u201cFor those who require more intensive services, providers are requested to refer the patient to local behavioral health care providers.\u201d\n\nLegislative records show a House panel approved a proposal in keeping with Abbott\u2019s promise that would have extended mental health screenings and treatment to low-income women through the first year of each baby\u2019s life. But House Bill 2135 by Rep. Garnet Coleman, D-Houston, died short of a House vote.\n\nMembers agreed on a measure potentially leading more mothers to be screened and treated. Abbott in June signed into law House Bill 2466 specifying that mothers of children whose births are covered by CHIP or Medicaid now qualify for mental health screenings and referrals (though not treatment) when the mothers take their infants in for a checkup. The measure\u2019s author, Rep. Sarah Davis, R-West University, told us that she expects mothers to embrace screenings by their children\u2019s pediatricians.\n\nWe emailed aides to Abbott about progress on this promise and didn\u2019t hear back.\n\nOur ruling:\n\nThe measures enacted so far are short of the governor\u2019s promise.\n\nWe rate this campaign vow a Promise Broken.", "image": "http://www.mystatesman.com/rf/image/PortalConfig/np-paid/assets/mystatesman/images/myStatesman200x200.png", "subject": "depression"}, "263610aad9b99de59fe14080e343db22": {"title": "Weather update: Depression may skip AP coast, eyeing Odisha for landfall", "summary": "The deep depression over West-Central Bay of Bengal has weakened into a depression midnight last night as expected, but is paring the Andhra Pradesh coast a direct hit.

It is a low-grade malaise that sticks with you. You feel down and like there are weights on you when you\u2019re walking around. You can\u2019t seem to shake this bad feeling you\u2019re having. But it\u2019s not like the flu which is what I would equate to depression to, it\u2019s more like the common cold.\n\nTo other people you may even appear like nothing is \u201cwrong.\u201d You can fake being \u201cokay\u201d more than someone with Major Depressive Disorder might be able to for example. People with dysthymia are sometimes referred to as \u201chigh functioning,\u201d which is a word that I don\u2019t particularly care for when it comes to mental illness. But, what that means is that they can go to work, do day-to-day activities. It\u2019s easy to feel insecure when you have mental health issues. If you\u2019re living with dysthymia you might be self-conscious about whether or not people can tell that you\u2019re depressed.\n\nI remember when I was in high school and experiencing severe depression (which is different from dysthymia) I wondered if anyone noticed or cared. I was in school for theater (I went to a performing arts high school in New York City) and I was a great actress, but in the sense that I pretended that I wasn\u2019t depressed, I didn\u2019t want to die and I was a regular teenager. But on the inside I was miserable. A person with dysthymia might appear like they are someone who doesn\u2019t have any mental health issues, but this isn\u2019t the case at all.\n\nHaving a low grade level of persistent depression, low mood, and feelings of consistent sadness takes a toll on your mind and body. It\u2019s exhausting to feel sad all the time.\n\nThere are certain symptoms to look for when it comes to spotting someone with dysthymia. A common one is perfectionism. Being highly critical of oneself is a symptom of depression, but particular of someone with dysthymia. One key point about dysthymia is that it\u2019s a more subtle presentation than someone with a pronounced mental illness such as Bipolar Disorder, Schizophrenia or even Major Depressive Disorder. It\u2019s important to remember that even though the presentation is more subtle it doesn\u2019t make the pain any less. It\u2019s still difficult for the person who is living with dysthymia to function.\n\nHaving a depression type cold is uncomfortable and it makes it hard to function well. The perfectionist can weigh heavily on someone living with dysthymia. They can become preoccupied with doing things correctly and become hyper-critical of themselves when they don\u2019t feel that they measure up to other people around them.\n\nIf a friend of yours looks like they are struggling with depression, but you\u2019re not sure it could be dysthymia. It\u2019s okay to check in with your friend and see if they\u2019re doing okay. You don\u2019t even need to ask \u201care you okay?\u201d Just ask them what\u2019s happening with them in their life. You can gauge how they\u2019re doing from what they say.\n\nRemember that depression doesn\u2019t look the same on everyone. The symptoms of depression vary depending on the person. You can take Aaron Beck\u2019s Depression Inventory to see where you fall in the scale. Regardless of how you\u2019re feeling, you are not alone. There are people out there who do care and want to help, it\u2019s just a matter of finding them.", "image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a2b5f39190000bb29035616.jpg?ops=1910_1000", "subject": "depression"}, "65031f1fe53452e989a366e4852770e1": {"title": "Depression in late teens linked to high school drop out", "summary": "By Cheryl Platzman Weinstock (Reuters Health) - Older teens struggling with depression are more than twice as likely to drop out of high school as peers without that mental illness or those who rec...", "url": "http://duke.fm/news/articles/2017/dec/08/depression-in-late-teens-linked-to-high-school-drop-out/", "date": "2017-12-08T22:37:10Z", "text": "By Cheryl Platzman Weinstock\n\n(Reuters Health) - Older teens struggling with depression are more than twice as likely to drop out of high school as peers without that mental illness or those who recovered from a bout of depression earlier in life, Canadian researchers say.\n\nUnderstanding that current or recent depression raises dropout risk may encourage schools to put a higher priority on mental health services, the study team writes in the Journal of Adolescent Health.\n\n\u201cThis is the first study of its kind to look at depression symptoms in the year before dropout,\u201d lead author Dr. Veronique Dupere, associate professor at the school of psycho-education at the University of Montreal, told Reuters Health by phone.\n\n\u201cThe role of depression in deciding to drop out was underestimated in previous studies because the timing was not properly considered. Depression is not stable. It tends to come and go,\u201d she said.\n\nFor the new analysis, researchers asked 6,773 students in 12 disadvantaged high schools with high dropout rates in and around Montreal to complete a screening questionnaire at the beginning of the school year. The brief assessment, conducted from 2012 to 2015, measured students\u2019 risk for dropout, and also asked for their sociodemographic information and their family\u2019s employment, education and structure.\n\nDuring a second round of interviews one year later, a subset of students were asked to participate in face-to-face meetings with a graduate student who assessed their mental health.\n\nStudents who dropped out of school in the year following their initial screening were also assessed for their mental health. Researchers compared these students to a similar group, also in the program, who didn\u2019t drop out.\n\nAlmost a quarter of the 183 adolescents who dropped out of school had clinically significant depression in the few months before quitting, researchers found.\n\nDupere said rates of conduct disorders and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were higher among the dropouts and the matched at-risk peers than among the average students. But ADHD was not a factor significantly distinguishing dropouts and matched at-risk students, although conduct disorder might be.\n\nIn 2015, an estimated three million adolescents aged 12 to 17 in the U.S. had experienced at least one major depressive episode in the past year, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. For many individuals, major depression can end up limiting their ability to carry out major life activities.\n\n\u201cSchool dropout portends other bad outcomes, like the inability to gain employment, involvement in substance abuse and problems with the juvenile justice system,\u201d said Dr. Laura Mufson of Columbia University Medical Center in New York City, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.\n\nMore than one in eight young people ages 16 to 24 are neither working nor in school, according to the Social Science Research Council\u2019s Measure of America project. That estimate is based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s 2013 American Community Survey.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited about the study because we need data like this,\u201d Dr. Tamar Mendelson of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland, told Reuters Health by phone.\n\n\u201cI think the problem of school dropout is really critical,\u201d said Mendelson, who wasn\u2019t involved in the new study. \u201cDepression and other mental health issues can sometimes fall through the cracks. Administrators may not understand all the issues and the best course to take. Data like this is helpful in highlighting the risks associated between depression and school dropout.\u201d\n\nOne limitation of the study is that a lot of teenagers have anxiety along with depression, Mufson noted.\n\n\u201cThe researchers looked at ADHD and conduct disorders.

One Waterloo researcher thinks the idea isn\u2019t so far-fetched.\n\nMark Ferro, a professor in the School of Public Health and Health Systems is investigating a link between systemic inflammation in the body and mental disorders; a connection that could allow physicians to identify people at risk for mental illness with a simple blood test.\n\n\u201cEvidence suggests there are shared inflammatory pathways in the body,\u201d said Ferro, who is the Canada Research Chair in Youth Mental Health. \u201cWe know that children with chronic physical conditions are two to three times more likely to develop a mental illness than healthy children. The question is why.\u201d\n\nUsing blood biomarkers\n\nUsing blood samples collected from 500 children recently diagnosed with a chronic physical condition, Ferro is tracking their health over two years. He suspects that those with high levels of inflammatory molecules in their blood will be more likely to develop a mental illness.\n\n\u201cWe know that after being diagnosed with a physical condition like asthma or diabetes, levels of inflammatory molecules \u2014 including tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and members of the interleukin family \u2014 rise in the body,\u201d said Ferro. \u201cBecause increased inflammation has also been found in people with mental illness, we think that activation of these inflammatory pathways explain, at least partly, why mental illness is so common in children with physical conditions.\u201d\n\nThe findings could one day allow for the development of new treatments for mental disorders.\n\n\u201cDown the road, we could be looking at targeted treatments that block the production of or body\u2019s response to these inflammatory molecules,\u201d said Ferro. \u201cUnderstanding the role inflammation plays is key in identifying those at risk, but also may be key in preventing the onset of mental illness in children, especially those with physical conditions.\u201d\n\nFerro hopes his research will also increase awareness around the physiology of mental health.\n\n\u201cWe often look at the body as fragmented systems,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the truth is, all our systems are connected.

While this is an alarming reality, our first responders, including our national police force, are impacted more than most.\n\nEvery day, Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officers deal with the pressures and stresses associated with policing. Throughout their careers they are exposed to higher rates of traumatic events than the general public.\n\nToday, at the RCMP Academy, Depot Division, the Honourable Ralph Goodale, Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, announced that a contract has been awarded to the University of Regina to conduct a study on the effects of policing on the mental health of RCMP officers.\n\nIts purpose is to identify psychological and physiological signs of trauma and stress-related disorders, including post-traumatic stress. The contract is valued at up to approximately $8.9 million.\n\n\u201cPost-traumatic stress injuries, and other operational stress injuries, disproportionately affect police officers \u2013 people who work tirelessly to keep our communities safe and secure. We are committed to providing RCMP officers with the mental health support the need to recover. The results of this study will help us better understand the problem and provide better support,\u201d says Goodale.\n\nThe research study will be led by Dr. Nicholas Carleton, a University of Regina psychology professor who is an internationally recognized leader in contemporary work on mental health for first responders and other public safety personnel.\n\n\u201cThis is much more than a research study,\u201d says Carleton. \u201cThis initiative has the potential to transform the health of our RCMP and, ultimately, all public safety personnel.\u201d\n\nThe study will be conducted through the use of wearable technology, annual psychological assessments and self-reporting measures. Participation will be voluntary and all data will be given anonymously, to protect the privacy of the RCMP member. These findings will assist the RCMP in developing long-term plans to support the mental health of its members and will be valuable to other public safety organizations, including police services, fire fighters and paramedics.\n\n\u201cThe RCMP recognizes the importance of the mental health of its members. We expect this study to provide invaluable information that can be used to enhance prevention and intervention measures to improve the psychological health and safety of our employees and other first responders,\u201d says Deputy Commissioner Daniel G.J. Dubeau, Acting Commissioner, Royal Canadian Mounted Police.\n\nDr. Vianne Timmons, University of Regina President and Vice-Chancellor, says every day we ask our first responders to do extraordinary things \u2013 from coping with emergencies and keeping people safe to being the difference between life and death, all of which can take a toll on these remarkable and dedicated people.\n\n\"Supporting and protecting the mental health of those who serve and protect us 365 days a year is of the utmost importance,\u201d says Timmons \u201cThe University of Regina is internationally recognized for its work in clinical psychology, particularly PTSD and other operational stress injuries, and through the efforts of our researchers this significant study aims to make a positive difference in the lives of many people in the years to come.\u201d\n\nWork on this project will begin immediately.\n\nRelated stories:\n\nNational Survey results underscore mental health concerns for public safety personnel\n\nUniversity of Regina paper reveals more help needed for first responders suffering from PTSD and other traumas\n\nExploring fear of the unknown", "image": "https://www.uregina.ca/external/communications/feature-stories/current/2017/images/12-083.jpg", "subject": "mental health"}, "556deb495642191bac85e1d2a4692f87": {"title": "CHAC faces rising mental health needs", "summary": "For more than four decades, the Community Health Awareness Council (CHAC) has played a critical role in Mountain View by providing affordable mental health care to vulnerable children and families.

But in recent years, the nonprofit has been overwhelmed by a growing need for mental and behavioral health services, and is fighting to find more money to safeguard the health and well-being of kids and families in the North County.\n\n\"Kids are coming in droves,\" said Marsha Deslauriers, CHAC's executive director. \"They want to be seen, they want to be heard. That's what students want -- they want someone to be there for them.\"\n\nEach year CHAC provides counseling and support to more than 17,000 people, ranging from young children and young adults to parents, both at its headquarters on El Camino Real as well as at 34 schools in Mountain View, Los Altos and Sunnyvale.\n\nStudents have free access to mental health care on campus, which expands its reach to those who might not be able to afford it. The cost is partially offset by the school districts but is largely subsidized by CHAC. The nonprofit also offers counseling in-house, priced on a sliding scale so that no one is turned away.\n\nCHAC is one of seven nonprofit organizations that benefit from the Voice's annual Holiday Fund. Donations to the fund are divided equally among the nonprofits and are administered by the Silicon Valley Community Foundation at no cost, so 100 percent of contributions go to the recipients.\n\nIndividual counseling alone costs CHAC close to $77 per hour to provide in schools, which adds up fast with 10,000 hours of counseling services to nearly 1,000 students between the Mountain View Whisman School District and the Mountain View-Los Altos High School District each year. In recent years, both school districts have ramped up funding to provide a slightly more balanced approach to paying for the costs, acknowledging the growing need for mental and behavioral health support as a school-sponsored service.\n\nBecause of its tight-knit relationship with schools and local cities -- spanning back to the organization's inception in 1973 -- CHAC is often the first line of defense for children struggling with depression and anxiety, and referrals by concerned teachers, staff and even fellow students are encouraged. The stigma that used to shroud mental health care has dissipated over the years, so more youth are willing to talk about their problems, Deslauriers said.\n\nCHAC's interns are the boots on the ground that spread out into the schools to provide the bulk of the support, but the title is a misnomer. Interns are highly trained, on average 39 years old, and 23 percent have published work in their field of expertise, Deslauriers said. Many of them come from Santa Clara University and psychology training programs run by Stanford and Palo Alto universities.\n\nFinding the space to host counseling services on the campus has historically been a challenge at both Mountain View and Los Altos high schools, prompting school district officials and CHAC to convert everything short of the broom closets into discreet locations for the critical mental health services. But Deslauriers said they have since reached capacity, and have been forced to move some of the counseling that typically would have been done on campus to its clinic.\n\n\"There are 17 rooms here at CHAC, and everyone's area is used for counseling in these closets, basically,\" she said. \"We are very fortunate to be a mental health provider with an in-house clinic.\"\n\nOver the last year, CHAC has poured money into training for what Deslauriers called \"culturally competent\" mental health care at CHAC, particularly for the local Latino population struggling with fear and uncertainty due to shifts in federal policies. She said the nonprofit's staff need to understand, talk and provide services that are \"in concert\" with other cultures, and have made strides connecting with the Latino community this year through a suite of services provided under the umbrella of the new \"Latinx\" program.\n\n\"You can't be in our world anymore without cultural humility,\" she said.\n\nCHAC has a $3 million annual budget, with a majority of the funding from local grants and private contributions. Less than a fourth of the revenue comes from fees. Almost all of the money collected, between 83 and 88 percent in recent years, is directly spent on services, putting CHAC's administration, infrastructure and other ancillary costs on a lean budget -- almost to a fault.\n\nDeslauriers said she has made it a priority for CHAC to invest more infrastructure as the organization continues to scale up, starting with badly needed IT upgrades. Despite being in the heart of Silicon Valley, CHAC still relies on a burdensome paper record system, and has to manage thousands of documents under strict confidentiality rules. The hope is to make a full transition to an electronic medical records system over the next 12 months.\n\nAs for what to do about the onslaught of demand for mental health services when not a corner of CHAC's headquarters is left vacant, Deslauriers said to stay tuned.\n\n\"There are some long-term plays still under consideration about where to house more counseling and behavioral health services,\" she said.", "image": "https://www.mv-voice.com/news/photos/2017/december/7/14611_main.jpg", "subject": "mental health"}}
