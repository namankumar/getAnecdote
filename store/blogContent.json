Until recently, I was unaware that others experienced the similar indications of separation, invisible lines that constricted entry to certain levels of reality, while I\u2019m left to flounder between them; I read a sentence written by a girl with an issue that mirrored mine, and understood that I was not alone, though I didn\u2019t often hear of anyone following this topic in discussion, anyone addressing it in full. You see, chronic depression is not only a mindset that keeps you trapped within itself, rather, allows your mind to wander with no intention of returning to you \u2014 dissociation is a symptom, attached indefinitely like any other, an asset when considering the full picture. It lurks on the edges of my vision when I find myself behind any wheel with an unrelenting desperation to keep the vehicle between painted lines, when I elude the doors of an event I\u2019m required to report for an extra moment because I can feel constricting notions of panic within my chest, when I become glassy while conducting an interview and struggle to find words. It\u2019s difficult to explain why I will cancel plans with a consistency I can hardly apply to all other aspects of my life, hard to conjure precisely why I stray from multitudes of eyes as I thread through crowds, all unsuspecting, though I feel the gazes are accusatory all the same. It strikes me as discomforting when I feel the need to look from the gazes of those that have known me for years, for butterflies often invade the pit of my stomach when I connect with a pair of eyes that I wrongly feel can see right through me. The simple suggestion that I may become anxious is enough to allow me to indulge in these very tendencies, abandoning those I made a promise to in order to seek refuge in newly found solace, the cycles both endless and extensive, stretching into areas of time I am unable to foresee. They say to breathe both deeply and slowly, though this act alone becomes strenuous when you can hardly recall how to properly suck air into your lungs, knowing it will be lacking in fulfillment all the same. They say to find a focal point, insignificant as it may be, one that will allow the dreamlike veils to slowly fall away until everything clears, until sunlight can lilt through and your vision no longer feels like a lie you\u2019re telling yourself. They say these things as though they may provide some degree of introspection, though everything remains a dream regardless, while the concept of reality looms darkly at your fingertips.\n\nDissociation is feeling uncomfortable amid a conversation as your reality feels skewed and your tone feels false in your throat, speaking itself an entity that feels foreign, alien to your tongue. Dissociation is feeling as though you may stumble while you walk a straight line, mirroring all others that swim around you, salmon fighting upstream while you simply follow in their wake as though you have a clue. It is a symptom that in no way trumps others, but provides the most frustration as you crave normalcy, even finding yourself wrongly pining for inklings of the familiar depression, for it would mean you felt grounded in your thoughts. Depression betrays both your emotions and your very reality with imagery that lacks in detail as it blankets your surroundings, providing panic you didn\u2019t require, thoughtless desperation you wish you could shed. The importance of grounding comes alive in these scenarios, even during instances where this action rings with impossibility, even when you feel overtaken by dreamlike anxieties about anxieties; remember it is your reality, whether it feels so, or otherwise. This is something I work on exclusively as I feel my foot hesitating over the break, for regular travelling speeds are blowing my hair back, causing a whisper of anxiety in my blood as I wonder what is preventing me from crashing. I strive to remember that though my mind and body refuse to work in accordance with one another, it doesn\u2019t make me any less real, any less raw; I strain to recall the sheer fact that though my memory doesn\u2019t serve me in cases where I can hardly recollect facts in an accurate sense, I will one day remember the full pictures. I try to recall landmarks and houses and green patches of grass, fragments of blue sky that follow me regardless, grocery stores and street corners that will remind me of what\u2019s truly real, no matter what methods my mind uses to betray me.", "url": "https://journal.thriveglobal.com/addressing-dissociation-ab8bd2815033", "summary": "They say to breathe both deeply and slowly, though this act alone becomes strenuous when you can hardly recall how to properly suck air into your lungs, knowing it will be lacking in fulfillment all the same.\nThey say these things as though they may provide some degree of introspection, though everything remains a dream regardless, while the concept of reality looms darkly at your fingertips.\nDissociation is feeling uncomfortable amid a conversation as your reality feels skewed and your tone feels false in your throat, speaking itself an entity that feels foreign, alien to your tongue.\nDissociation is feeling as though you may stumble while you walk a straight line, mirroring all others that swim around you, salmon fighting upstream while you simply follow in their wake as though you have a clue.\nDepression betrays both your emotions and your very reality with imagery that lacks in detail as it blankets your surroundings, providing panic you didn\u2019t require, thoughtless desperation you wish you could shed.", "timescraped": 1513925493.730081, "category": {"words": 825, "personal": 38, "thirdperson": 6, "condition": 4, "recovery": 0}}, "694650b9f7b18b6b3c321d56f31e44b3": {"title": "Is Social Media Hurting You? \u2013 Thrive Global", "image": "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*Gb_GaPSv9MhloYB08RSZHw.jpeg", "text": "Is Social Media Hurting You?\n\nThe impact of social media on your health and well-being.\n\nImage \u00a9 Shutterstock / Leungchopan\n\nSocial media is evolving, with the major platforms constantly offering new tools and features to attract and retain their users. Facebook has a live-streaming feature. Instagram has Stories. Twitter has the President\u2019s tweets. Well, maybe that last one isn\u2019t part of the evolution. But it\u2019s certainly one of the aspects of social media that keeps us all spending time on it. In fact, the amount of time people spend on social media is consistently increasing. Teens spend a staggering 9 hours a day using social media \u2014 and some 13-year olds even check their social media accounts 100 times a day. A report from earlier this year noted that 69% of all U.S. adults are now social media users, often making social media a core part of their daily routine.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable why social media has become such an integral factor in our day-to-day lives. It\u2019s become the de facto way that many of us seek news updates, find entertainment, and even communicate with each other. But does all of the \u201cliking,\u201d \u201cfollowing,\u201d and \u201ccommenting\u201d mean we are truly connecting with each other?\n\nSocial connection is a healthy and necessary part of the human experience. A number of studies have examined the benefits of social ties, finding that people with strong social connection have lower levels of anxiety and depression, a stronger immune system, faster recovery times from illness and even an increased chance of longevity. And on the flip-side, studies have also shown that a lack of social connection is correlated with lower self-esteem, a lower sense of empathy for others, vulnerability to disease, higher blood pressure and an increased risk of depression.\n\nBut where does social media fit into all this? Does it count as a legitimate means of connection to others? Or is it actually isolating us even more than we even realize?\n\nWHAT WE KNOW ALREADY\n\nThere have been a number of studies examining the consequences of social comparison \u2014 something most of us have experience with. One moment you\u2019re scrolling innocently through a friend\u2019s feed, then next thing you know you\u2019re 4 months deep looking at their tropical vacation photos, wondering why you haven\u2019t gone anywhere in years and why it\u2019s taking so long to get your life on track so that you can actually take that trip you\u2019ve been talking about for nearly a decade now.\n\nSocial comparison can also rear its ugly head when we start to compare our bodies and appearance to others, tearing ourselves down in the process. A study out of the UK surveyed 1500 Facebook and Twitter users, finding that 62% of the group reported feeling inadequate and 60% reported feelings of jealousy from comparing themselves to other users.\n\nEven though we all know people strive to create that \u201cpicture perfect\u201d life on social media, only posting photos that they want others to see \u2014 we still judge ourselves against that standard.\n\nPrevious research has also revealed that social media could potentially:\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA AND YOUR OVERALL WELL-BEING\n\nOf course, there are some skeptics who maintain that only those with lower self-esteem will be negatively impacted by social comparison. And some studies found social media has benefited relationships by reinforcing connections made in real life \u2014 which makes sense, particularly when you are staying in touch with old friends whom you would otherwise have little to no contact with.\n\nStill, a recent study that examined Facebook use and well-being suggests that social media, in large part, may be doing more harm than good.\n\nThe study looked at over 5,000 adults from across the country to see how their mental and their physical health changed over time in association with Facebook activity over the course of two years. Their metrics for well-being included: life satisfaction, self-reported mental health, self-reported physical health and BMI (body mass index). Their metrics for Facebook use included: liking posts, creating posts and clicking on links. The researchers also had measures of the participant\u2019s real-world social networks.\n\nThe study distinguishes itself from past research by its comprehensive analysis and multi-dimensional approach \u2014 using three waves of data over a period of two years, implementing objective measures of Facebook use, and integrating information about the participant\u2019s real-world social networks which allowed them to directly compare face-to-face networks and online interactions.\n\nWhat they found was astonishing: where face-to-face social interactions were positively correlated with overall well-being, Facebook activity was negatively associated. The results were especially telling when it came to mental health:\n\n\u201cMost measures of Facebook use in one year predicted a decrease in mental health in a later year. We found consistently that both liking others\u2019 content and clicking links significantly predicted a subsequent reduction in self-reported physical health, mental health and life satisfaction,\u201d said the authors of the study, Holly Shakya and Nicholas Christakis.\n\nThe verdict on just why this correlation exists is still out. Researchers cannot say definitively why it occurs. But while prior research argued that it\u2019s the quality of time spent on social media that really matters, Shakya and Christakis showed that it\u2019s also the quantity of social media interactions that play a role. So it\u2019s not just screen time that impacts our well-being, but the fact that we replace meaningful social interaction with social media.\n\nIn short \u2014 social media is not a substitute for real world, face-to-face interactions with others.\n\nWith the average Facebook user spending nearly an hour on the site every day, and many of us checking social media apps almost immediately after we wake up every morning \u2014 it\u2019s time we start assessing the influence social media is having in our lives. While it certainly has its merits and its allure, it may be hurting us in ways that we have yet to actively realize. But by becoming more aware of its impact, we can begin to take more proactive measures that allow us to be more in control of our health and our well-being.\n\nThis post is authored by the Tony Robbins editorial team and first appeared on the Tony Robbins blog.", "url": "https://journal.thriveglobal.com/is-social-media-hurting-you-a911a9c5afcd", "summary": "But it\u2019s certainly one of the aspects of social media that keeps us all spending time on it.\nTeens spend a staggering 9 hours a day using social media \u2014 and some 13-year olds even check their social media accounts 100 times a day.\nA report from earlier this year noted that 69% of all U.S. adults are now social media users, often making social media a core part of their daily routine.\nBut while prior research argued that it\u2019s the quality of time spent on social media that really matters, Shakya and Christakis showed that it\u2019s also the quantity of social media interactions that play a role.\nSo it\u2019s not just screen time that impacts our well-being, but the fact that we replace meaningful social interaction with social media.", "timescraped": 1513925474.4740832, "category": {"words": 1003, "personal": 25, "thirdperson": 11, "condition": 6, "recovery": 1}}, "521fe31637f09f00a0a05b936c8cd5f4": {"title": "How to Become the Best in the World at What You Do \u2013 Thrive Global", "image": "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*Ng4412G3xY8DiI-1LbZQig.jpeg", "text": "How to Become the Best in the World at What You Do\n\nIt can feel impossible to move toward your dreams. You know exactly what you want to do, but there are endless obstacles in your way.\n\nThere is so much competition \u2014 thousands or millions of people competing to do exactly what you want to do.\n\nHow do you get out of the rat race?\n\nHow do you advance quick enough to not have your dreams smashed into submission by society and imploded by \u201creality\u201d?\n\nHow do you make the needed leaps to move beyond the masses vying for a similar position?\n\nAfter all, you have bills to pay and tons of other responsibilities. You only have a limited amount of time each day. After work and everything else you\u2019ve got going on, it\u2019s easy to justify waiting until tomorrow. Even if you have the raw energy to do your work, you may feel guilty breaking from your relational obligations.\n\nIt truly can feel hopeless and overwhelming. There\u2019s so much to learn. It can be easy to doubt our own abilities. Maybe we should just give up and accept reality for what it is?\n\nThe Truth Is\u2026\n\nMost of the competition are not hard to surpass. They\u2019re dealing with the same existential and practical challenges you are. Their life isn\u2019t structured for optimal creative expression. They are the primary obstacle in the path. Most will quit long before they ever really begin \u2014 always remaining mediocre at what they do.\n\nWith a few tweaks, you\u2019ll quickly drop through a wormhole placing you in the top 5\u201310 percent in your field. The challenge then becomes to move from there to the top \u2014 which movement is the real contest. Getting to the top 5\u201310 percent merely requires a change in lifestyle. Getting to the top 1 percent requires a fundamental change in your being.\n\nThis post is a framework to quickly get you into the top 5\u201310 percent of your field so you can begin the real quest of becoming the best at what you do.\n\nPhase One will get you to the top 5\u201310 percent of your field. Once you\u2019re at this level, you are getting paid enough for your art to live on. This is key, as Paul Graham has said, \u201cOnce you cross the threshold of profitability, however low, your runway becomes infinite.\u201d He calls the lowest tier of profitability, \u201cRamen Profitable,\u201d which means a startup (or business of any sort) makes just enough to pay the founders\u2019 living expenses.\n\nInfinite runway means you can now dedicate all your \u201cwork\u201d time to your work. You are no longer moonlighting or squeezing time in the margins of your life. You can pay your bills and eat Ramen. This is where Phase Two begins, and is really the beginning of your artistic journey \u2014 becoming the best in the world at what you do.\n\nLet\u2019s begin:\n\nPhase One: Getting To Ramen Profitable (Or Sustainable)\n\n1. Start As An Amateur\n\nKenzie and Harris were recently married. They had both dropped out of Brigham Young University and were working at the Apple store in downtown Salt Lake City. On the side, they were recording music covers and posting them on YouTube and Vine.\n\nThey had enough money in savings to live on a year, so they quit at Apple to make a run at becoming professional musicians. Every day, they would post Vines. For several months, their work went mostly unnoticed. They had a few thousand followers tops.\n\nThen, everything changed. They posted a Vine that immediately went viral. The next day, they were contacted by some of the top Viners as well as agents who gave them contracts. They were now Ramen Profitable, had amazing connections, and on their way to making an amazing career as musicians.\n\nKenzie and Harris wouldn\u2019t have had their breakthrough if they didn\u2019t start as amateurs. They had some raw talent. But more than anything, they were willing to put themselves out there over and over and over. Quantity became quality. And then they put something out that people loved.\n\nVery few people have the humility to start as amateurs. They procrastinate doing the work they want in the name of perfectionism. You know these people. The one\u2019s who have been saying for years that they\u2019re going to do something but never do. Yet inwardly, they\u2019re terrified of what other people will think of them.\n\nThey\u2019re caught in a state of paralysis by analysis \u2014 too busy calculating and never reaching a state of flow. Rather than doing work their own way, they do what they think will be well-received \u2014 being merely imitators of what is already popular.\n\n2. Get Coaching/Education\n\nTake your dreams seriously. Most people don\u2019t. Take them serious enough to become amazing and move beyond mediocre. Get education and coaching.\n\n\u201cWhen the student is ready the teacher will appear.\u201d \u2014 Buddha\n\nEver since returning from a two-year mission trip, I\u2019ve always known I wanted to be a writer. However, my dream remained a figment of my imagination until I became serious enough to get a mentor.\n\nI\u2019ve had two mentors that have changed how I write. One of my mentors was a young professor who taught me more in three months than I had learned in the previous four years.\n\nActually, he taught me more about academic writing and research in three months than most people learn through an entire PhD. With his help, I was easily able to get into the graduate school of my choice.\n\nI started blogging about 21 months ago. Knowing this is something I\u2019m serious about, I decided to get coaching. However, this time, I did it in the form of a virtual online course.\n\nWithin a month of taking the course, I wrote a blog post that was read over five million times across multiple outlets and in several languages. This online course was not the reason for my success; but it was an important part of the progression I would inevitably get one way or another.\n\nYou\u2019ll know when you\u2019re ready for the next level, because you\u2019ll make the proper investments in the teachers to help you get there. You\u2019re level of commitment can directly be measured to how invested you are. Once, committed, you\u2019ll be willing to make whatever changes are needed to upgrade into the person you desire to become.\n\n3. Stop Living The Broken Rules Everyone Else Is Living\n\nIf it\u2019s popular it\u2019s wrong. Most people are mediocre at what they do for a reason. They\u2019re playing by rules that halt optimal performance. They are climbing traditional ladders intended to slow them down and keep them average.\n\nWhen everyone else is zigging, that\u2019s when you zag. Darren Hardy says you should run \u201ctoward the thing everyone else is running from\u201d in order to stand out from the crowd.\n\nAs Peter Diamandis says, \u201cThe day before something is a breakthrough, it\u2019s a crazy idea.\u201d If what you\u2019re doing doesn\u2019t seem slightly crazy to you, and very crazy to other people, you\u2019re probably following the safe path.\n\nInstead of following the rules set by society, create your own rules. Restructure the game to automate your success. Dismiss the haters, convention, and conformity. Follow your heart and the voice inside you encouraging faith and forward movement. In order to be happy, you must build a lifestyle around being true to yourself. If you\u2019re true to yourself, good things will follow.\n\n4. Be Consistent Until You Have A Break Through\n\nPatience.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t had your big break yet, keep going. Consistency is the most fundamental virtue to becoming the person you want to be. Almost everyone can sprint for a while. But most burn-out and quit. Everything meaningful in life is a marathon \u2014 meant to test your commitment and will.\n\nIf this is what you love doing, you\u2019ll do it regardless of the outcome. In fact, obsession with a particular outcome will keep you from attaining your desired results. Your work will be forced rather than organically lived.\n\nThere is a natural law known as the compound effect. If you invest a small amount of money consistently, eventually compound interest takes over and growth becomes exponential. The same holds true for any habit, whether good or bad. If you do something long enough, compounding will take effect, momentum will surge, and you\u2019ll begin to experience exponential results.\n\nIf you want it bad enough, you will do whatever it takes to make it happen. If you don\u2019t, you won\u2019t. You\u2019ll be willing to reduce time with friends and hobbies, make big asks, take risks, find a mentor, get educated, and look foolish. You\u2019ll be surprised how quickly you become Ramen Profitable when you take your work seriously.\n\nPhase Two: Becoming The Best In The World At What You Do\n\nThe person who succumbs to temptation knows far less about its power than the person who resists it. Experience is key. Knowledge only becomes wisdom when it\u2019s properly and consistently applied. Thus, the importance of learning from people who have actually been there, as opposed to sideline spectators. Never take advice from someone you wouldn\u2019t want to switch places with.\n\nGetting to the top 5\u201310 percent in your field can be done by following principles taught by other people. However, in order to become the best at what you do, at some point you leave it all behind. You become an innovator.A pioneer. An artist.\n\nIn order to get to the top 1 percent of performers, you must come up to the razor\u2019s edge \u2014 the brink of disaster \u2014 where probability of failure is high. At this point, everything you\u2019ve been taught is opposed by what you feel you should do. But your intuition is operating at a higher level.\n\n5. Structure Your Entire Life To Optimize Your Performance\n\nEntering the realm of the best in the world requires becoming holistic about your art. Everything you do matters. Every moment of your life either contributes to or takes away from what you\u2019re trying to accomplish \u2014 the food you eat \u2014 activities you do \u2014 people you spend time with \u2014 and how you spend your mornings and evenings.\n\nMost people\u2019s lives are structured in a reactive way. The first thing they do in the morning is check their email or social media. They may even read a good book. But all of these things are highly addictive inputs.\n\nIn order to become a creative master, you must focus your efforts on outputs by leveraging your subconscious mind. While you\u2019re away from your work, like sleeping, spending time with friends, or other activities, your subconscious is working through and mulling over the problems you\u2019re trying to solve.\n\nThe first thing to do when you wake up is output. This may be in the form of writing in a journal to capture all the work your subconscious has been doing while you were sleeping.\n\nOr immediately getting to the project you\u2019re working on. When you get out of a meeting or finish any form of activity, rather than going directly to your email or other input, maximize your subconscious by going directly to output \u2014 your work. Creative and insightful eruptions of intellectual inspiration will flow.\n\nBeing healthy and free from physical pain is also crucial for enhanced performance. In his book, The Great Pain Deception, Stephen Ozanich wrote:\n\n\u201cPain and other chronic symptoms are physical manifestations of unresolved internal conflict. Symptoms surface as the instinctual mechanism for self-survival. They are messages from the inner self wanting to be heard, but ego takes center-stage, and hides the truth within the shadows of the unconscious mind: which is the body.\u201d\n\nIn the 1990\u2019s neuroscientist Candice Pert, Ph.D., shared her discovery that the body, not the brain, is the subconscious mind which communicates via neuropeptides. Indeed, human beings are holistic. Our body and mind work in unison.\n\nWhen we have unresolved tension in our lives, this tension is generally manifest in physical illness. When we clear ourselves of this tension, we allow our body to naturally and organically heal. When our bodies are healthy, we\u2019re far more prone to inspiration.\n\nLess is more. When you focus on results, rather than being busy, you\u2019re 100 percent ON when you\u2019re working and 100 percent OFF when you\u2019re not. This not only allows you to be present in the moment, but allows you the needed time to rest and recover.\n\nThe science is very compelling. Psychological-detachment from work is essential for being engaged while you\u2019re working! Here are other benefits of psychological detachment from work:\n\nYour ability to work at a high level is like fitness. If you never took a break between sets, you wouldn\u2019t be able to build strength, stamina, and endurance. However, not all \u201crest\u201d produces recovery. Certain things are more soothing than others.\n\nRecovering from my work generally consists of writing in my journal, listening to music, spending time with my wife and kids, preparing and eating delicious food, or serving other people. These things rejuvenate me. They make my work possible, but also meaningful.\n\nHow do you recover?\n\nDo you have a regular environment optimized for resetting and recovery?\n\n7. Have A Pre-Performance Routine That Gets You In Flow\n\nJosh Waitzkin is a genius when it comes to learning and optimal human performance. He was a Chess prodigy as a child \u2014 he won five National Championship titles in Tai Chi Chuan \u2014 and is now focusing on becoming world-class at Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. He takes the fundamental principles of learning from the ground up and applies them laterally to different disciplines.\n\nIn order to \u201cget in the zone,\u201d Josh recommends a Pre-Performance routine. The goal is to reduce stress and anxiety so you can be present. These routines often take 20\u201360 minutes to put you in the zone. However, Josh recommends incrementally reducing the routine time to the point where simply thinking about it clicks you into the zone.\n\nThe purpose of the pre-performance routine is to alter your emotional state. Most people experience emotional resistance before engaging in a task, like say, writing.\n\nThat resistance could be a number of negative and suppressed emotions such as fear, uncertainty, and feelings of inadequacy. You don\u2019t want these emotions to influence you while you work. They will negatively influence how you perform.\n\nThe pre-performance routine is intended to alter your emotional state to one of courage, peace, acceptance, and love. From these emotional states, your work will be far superior. Without question, how you feel in the moment you do you work determines how well you do.\n\n8. Embrace Fear And Suffering\n\n\u201cThe hero and the coward both feel the same thing, but the hero uses his fear, projects it onto his opponent, while the coward runs. It\u2019s the same thing, fear, but it\u2019s what you do with it that matters.\u201d \u2014 Cus D\u2019Amato\n\nThe idea of fearlessness is a false concept that is imposed by spectators. True performers feel fear and experience suffering. However, they learned to settle-into it like a yoga stretch.\n\nCycling is a sport notorious for the amount of suffering required. As Tyler Hamilton has said, \u201cI discovered when I went all out, when I put 100 percent of my energy into some intense, impossible task \u2014 when my heart was jack-hammering, when lactic acid was sizzling through my muscles \u2014 that\u2019s when I felt good, normal, balanced.\u201d\n\nCyclists often refer to \u201cthe pain cave,\u201d which is a mental place they go deeper and deeper into as they\u2019re competing. \u201cI went deeper than I thought I would.\u201d \u201cI was at the limit.\u201d \u201cI was totally pinned.\u201d You often hear phrases like these in interviews after a cycling race.\n\n\u201cMental resilience is arguably the most critical trait of a world-class performer, and it should be nurtured continuously. Left to my own devices, I am always looking for ways to become more and more psychologically impregnable. When uncomfortable, my instinct is not to avoid the discomfort but to become at peace with it. My instinct is always to seek out challenges as opposed to avoiding them.\u201d \u2014 Josh Waitzkin\n\nWhen you begin feeling uncomfortable, that\u2019s when you start feeling good. That\u2019s when you\u2019re growing. No pain no gain. That\u2019s your happy place. That\u2019s where most people stop. But not you.\n\n9. Do It Because Of Love\n\nIn the end, there\u2019s nothing more important than deep connection with humanity. The love you feel for other people is an experience that eclipses all others in life.\n\nYour level of success is based on your level of contribution. It\u2019s not about what you can get, it\u2019s about what you can give. The world gives to the givers and takes from the takers. You don\u2019t need to worry about what you\u2019ll get, because you know your contribution is huge.\n\nSo much of training and personal progress is introspective \u2014 focused on the self. However, moving outward and focusing on the needs of others provides new meaning for your work. Become the best at what you do, not because of the legacy you\u2019ll leave, but because of the lives you\u2019ll bless.\n\nThere is a four stage hierarchy of motivations in psychology.\n\nAt stage one, you are motivated by fear. Everything you do is to avoid punishment or negative outcomes. You only do what you think others want you to do, being completely dependent on them. According to decision theory, this form of motivation is prevention focused.\n\nAt stage two, you are motivated by reward. Everything you do is to get what you want. If you are in business, you do only that which you believe will get you ahead. Thus, you are promotion focused and although highly independent, you can\u2019t see outside of your own limited worldview. You\u2019re too fixated on what you want, so much so that you\u2019re unable to truly collaborate or get genuine feedback.\n\nBoth stage one and stage two demonstrate extrinsic motivation, which is far less powerful than intrinsic motivation.\n\nAt stage three, you are motivated by duty. You\u2019re going to do what you believe you should whether you receive a reward or not. You have no fear of punishment. You are intrinsically motivated. You\u2019re willing to do whatever it takes to get the result, even if that means changing your initial mindset, ideas, or strategies. Even still, there\u2019s a lack of something truly magical when you do something only out of duty.\n\nAt stage four, you are motivated by love. You have moved beyond worry for your own needs. Your aim is to bring as much joy to each individual as you possibly can. Your love transcends human reasoning. It drives you to do things most would consider crazy. You no longer live by conventional rules or wisdom. You have a plan, yet that plan is continually upgraded through connecting new dots via collaborations and inspiration. You\u2019re no longer tied to a specific outcome but you have conviction and faith that the best outcome will occur.\n\nConclusion\n\nYou can quickly get to the point where you do what you love for a living. This will require hard work, sacrifice, and consistency. However, what got you here won\u2019t get you there. Becoming the best involves transcending guidelines and following your instinct.\n\nYou get to decide the level of impact or quality of the work you do. You can become the best in the world.

Before you make sweeping changes, take a look at the little, everyday parts of your life. Big things like career, house, family etc, really do matter, but so do the small things that make up your day. Improving your happiness with something that occurs several times a day is just as important as fixing the big issues.\n\nOne such thing is eating, because it happens many times every day. If you improve how you experience eating, you can get really great \"value for effort\" in terms of quality of life.\n\nIt should be so easy: In our modern world where availability and selection is better than ever, eating should just be about nutrition and satisfaction. But it is not just that. Our relationship with food is fraught with guilt, anxiety and worry. If you yourself haven\u2019t experienced this, someone close to you has.\n\nThe Pew Research Center (December 1, 2016) found that a majority of Americans think they should eat healthier and consider US eating habits to be less healthy than earlier.\n\nA significant portion of us are unhappy about our bodies (Fiske et al., Eating Behaviors, 15, 2014, 357-365), and many Americans, while spending billions of dollars on diets and weight loss products, are embarrassed about dieting.\n\nWe eat many times a day and think about eating even more often. When we worry about our eating habits, it causes unhappiness by a thousand cuts, because we are constantly caught in negative emotions and thoughts.\n\nMostly, we suffer alone, because an uneasy relationship with food is a source of shame. The perception seems to be that cool people don't struggle with food. They eat what they want and still maintain a healthy weight. The rest of us just haven\u2019t succeeded in finding the right diet. And we hold that against ourselves.\n\nWe are all part of the problem. The way we talk about diet and eating makes food into a test of our personal character. We identify ourselves by our food preferences and we talk about sinful eating. We judge ourselves and each other by how (un)healthy we eat.\n\nWe think about food a lot, and we hate ourselves for that. We try to restrain ourselves, we give in to temptations, and we feel guilty afterwards. It can dominate our days, especially when we have 'sinned': Even if everything else in your life is near perfect, you can still be miserable if you struggle with food, because you have to deal with it every time you have a meal, every time someone around you eats, everytime you are confronted with the opportunity to buy food or with an image of food. In other words, every few seconds.\n\nMy quarrel with this modern view of food is that it ignores basic facts about human nature and causes unnecessary suffering. We misplace the blame, when we view it as a personal failure to have a troubled relationship with food. The game is rigged against us.\n\nThe modern world simply does not work very well with our biology and our basic instincts. We often perceive the way we live today as a natural and logical result of human evolution, thus believing that we should be able to make a modern life work. But our societies have developed not out of biological evolution (at least not of late), but out of cultural and technological changes.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t fit our biology anymore. Our brains and bodies are designed for a completely different food environment. We are built to preserve energy, to eat when food is there and to be focused on our next meal. In a world where food is never more than 30 feet away, this is a problem.\n\nOur eating used to be regulated from the outside by the scarcity of food. Now, we rely on an internal regulation that hasn\u2019t been upgraded to the current situation. Combine that with a life full of stress and not enough exercise or sleep, all of which decreases our ability for self regulation. It is a wonder that we don\u2019t have even bigger problems with eating.\n\nYou've probably heard all this before, but we need to acknowledge it on a fundamental level. Otherwise, we will continue to judge ourselves for just being human. Despite this age of technology and updates (perhaps human 2.0 is underway?), we cannot change the facts of our biology, and we should factor them in when we judge ourselves.\n\nPerhaps if we stop blaming the individual, we can start working towards societies that allow for a better balance with human biology. But for now, we struggle with food.\n\nWe find our own ways to try to manage the dissonance between the external environment and the internal impulses. It is not an easy job, and I wish we gave ourselves more credit for working so hard at it - and left more leeway for finding idiosyncratic solutions.\n\nIf Shame Worked, Obesity Wouldn't Exist\n\n\"But without the shame holding me back, I'll be out of control and blow up to hippopotamus size\", my clients say when we talk about this. The old idea of guilt, shame and punishment being the thin line between us and a life of sloth and gluttony is alive and well in us. Only it isn't true, quite the opposite.\n\nWhen we feel shame and regret, we are less able to balance our eating and more prone to turn to consolation, often in the form of food, after which we feel guilty. And so the vicious cycle continues.\n\nA study from University of Pennsylvania showed that the more people had internalized negative views of obesity, the more likely they were to have problems linked to obesity.\n\nShame was not making them live a more healthy life, in fact, it was increasing their health risks significantly (Pearl et al., Obesity, 2017; 25 (2): 317). If shame worked, we wouldn't have the obesity levels we do.\n\nShame has been tried, are you ready for trying something else? Instead of blaming yourself for not meeting the unrealistic expectation of an easy relationship with food, give yourself permission to struggle with it and find your own way. Eat your meals without that side of shame.\n\nThis is not a short cut to weight loss. My book on mindful eating says that eating mindfully instead of dieting can make you happier and reach a balanced relationship with food. When it came out, many people asked more questions about how letting go of diets could make them lose weight, not about how it could make them happier. The paradigm of the virtue of weight loss is strong.\n\nThis is not about getting thinner. It is about getting happier. Which would you rather be? Which do you choose?\n\nKamilla Lange is a clinical psychologist, a mindfulness instructor, and an external lecturer for US college students. She is also the author of a book on mindful eating called Vind Kampen mod V\u00e6gten.

Although she referred to loss and grief as it applies to the death of a loved one, you might experience some of the same stages when going through other kinds of loss in your life. Understanding the grief cycle helps you forgive yourself and move on from loss.\n\nThe Grief Cycle\n\nOne challenge you may face is feeling as though you\u2019re not healing properly. You might find your road to forgiveness loops back on itself and takes you to the same point you thought you\u2019d passed in your grief. The five stages of grief aren\u2019t levels you move through completely to attain a state of acceptance. They\u2019re gradual points along a spectrum, and it can sometimes be hard to tell where you are on it at any given moment. Instead of seeing grief as a linear path, then, it\u2019s easier to see it as a grief cycle, one that may carry you through each phase many times before you\u2019re ready to move ahead.\n\nWith deeper insight into the cycle of grief and loss, you learn how to overcome it. Knowing what to expect after a traumatic experience can provide comfort when you need it most and help you hold onto hope. Whether you\u2019re healing from the loss of a loved one or moving past a mistake you\u2019ve made and learning to forgive yourself, knowing these steps will let you see the process more clearly.\n\nDenial\n\nWhile your first reaction after a traumatic experience is shock, it quickly gives way to denial. You might reject the event altogether or avoid thinking about it. People in the denial phase may try to distract themselves or engage in behaviors that help them ignore what they find painful. They might also become isolated by choice.\n\nDenial is a protective measure to give yourself distance and time to prepare yourself mentally for the long road of healing ahead of you. When dealing with guilt, denial can be particularly strong and pervasive. It\u2019s normal to experience it at first, but over time, it\u2019s important to confront painful facts and address them directly. Doing so will carry you into the next stages of the cycle and allow you to heal.\n\nAnger\n\nAnger often grows from pain, especially as part of the cycle of grief. \u201cIt isn\u2019t fair,\u201d you might tell yourself. Forgiveness is the last thing on your mind. If you\u2019re coping with guilt, you may even feel angry at those whom you have wronged. As difficult as it is to experience, anger can be a useful emotion; it provokes change and drives you forward. It is also the stage of grief that\u2019s most likely to return during other phases. You may cycle between denial, anger, and bargaining for some time before you\u2019re ready to move into the next stages and adjust to the new course of your life.\n\nBargaining\n\nIt isn\u2019t uncommon to try reasoning with your circumstances, a phase K\u00fcbler-Ross described as bargaining. When seeking forgiveness for yourself, the bargaining stage is often associated with guilt. You may feel that if you could only change the past, you could avoid pain to yourself and others. Some people bargain with themselves or other people. Others bargain with prayers or promises.\n\nBargaining is a means of asserting control over events you can\u2019t change. By trying to establish control in this way, you hope to impose order on a problem and set things right. This stage can be useful as a way to avoid future problems, but lingering here can produce guilt. Your goal is to move forward, not look back at what has already happened.\n\nDepression\n\nA certain degree of depression is a normal reaction to loss and grief. Sadness is also natural, but depression is more than simply feeling sad. It can cause you to lose interest in activities you once enjoyed or make you feel as though everything is a struggle. This phase involves finding ways to separate yourself from what has gone before and come to terms with the fact that bargaining and anger cannot change the facts. Also enjoyment of physical activities such as walking, gardening, or therapy also helps depression.", "url": "https://journal.thriveglobal.com/what-the-grief-cycle-teaches-is-about-forgiveness-29650f9e4e50", "summary": "What The Grief Cycle Teaches Is About ForgivenessWhen Elisabeth Kubler-Ross wrote her 1969 book, On Death and Dying, she described a pattern psychologists had long known but hadn\u2019t yet defined.\nUnderstanding the grief cycle helps you forgive yourself and move on from loss.\nInstead of seeing grief as a linear path, then, it\u2019s easier to see it as a grief cycle, one that may carry you through each phase many times before you\u2019re ready to move ahead.\nWith deeper insight into the cycle of grief and loss, you learn how to overcome it.\nPeople in the denial phase may try to distract themselves or engage in behaviors that help them ignore what they find painful.", "timescraped": 1513925481.8406599, "category": {"words": 705, "personal": 0, "thirdperson": 7, "condition": 2, "recovery": 0}}, "ad2205fc60856af0c0c1d63a8aedc819": {"title": "Be like Bamboo", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/skinner-production/stories/featured_images/000/011/560/large/FullSizeRender_164.jpg?1502210335", "text": "During our lifetime we are told to fight for what we want in life.

This is one of life's hardest lesson.\n\nSo how do bounce back when life has pushed you down? How can you see the blue skies when black clouds are surrounding you? How do you cope when you can't save someone's life?\n\nWhen I first launched the Birch Hoven Project, I promised to have an honest relationship with those that followed me and I have spent an uncomfortable two months debating how to approach this sensitive subject that is close to my heart. Even now as I write these words, I keep pausing with uncertainty, worried about the consequences of me opening up a little more.\n\nYou see, two months ago my father was diagnosed with cancer. Sadly the medical teams haven't been quick enough to keep up with the disease and now he's in the later stages, suffering and getting more frail each day. It's torturous to watch him fight and it's even worst knowing there is nothing I can do to help. It's hard to accept that I can't fight this battle for him or take his place...ultimately I know I can't save him.\n\nDuring this time, I have reserved all my spare energy to process what is unfolding whilst trying to build up my emotional resilience so I won't fall apart when he takes his final breath to make his way home.\n\nTo those who felt I suddenly disappeared from their lives and to those that didn't know, I'm truly sorry I was unable to share the details of my situation. This initially was a process I needed to work out for myself and truth be told, I didn't want to burden you on your path. I hope you will understand and always know that your happiness is at the forefront of my mind.\n\nI hope by sharing my experience now it will help those of you out there struggling to steer through your life crisis. More importantly I want you to understand what being resilient really means and the damage caused by trying to resist changes you may have no control over.\n\nWhat does it mean to be resilient?\n\nTo be resilient is to able to recover quickly from trauma without it causing life long damage.\n\nVery often you will hear resilient people compared to bamboo for their abilities to be flexible without breaking. Personally I think this Japanese proverb explains the concept of being resilient perfectly.\n\n'The Bamboo that bends is stronger than the Oak that resists' -Japanese proverb\n\nSo let's talk about how YOU can build up your emotional resilience so you can take on anything that is thrown your way.\n\n5 tips to build up Emotional Resilience\n\n\u2022 Seperate fact from fiction.\n\nWhen something terrible happens, we initially let our feelings dictate our actions and the majority of the time, we either end up falling into 'poor me' syndrome or regretting our actions at a later time.\n\nTo avoid this, gather your facts carefully and contemplate all angles before taking any action. A good tip is to try to see the point of view of others involved. Try as hard as you can to focus on those cold hard facts first to get clear perspective of your situation.\n\n\u2022 Be Self Aware.\n\nOnce you can see the reality of your predicament, you can focus on how you feel. Those that practice mindfulness on a regular basis will not find the concept of 'feeling' the moment new, but for those that don't, I would suggest you try to find a natural spot and try still you mind.\n\nHopefully this will allow your inner voice to be heard above the roar of the ego that will act as a self protective mechanism to stop you feeling the pain you are meant to feel.\n\nIt is important to remember that feelings are abstract and like the clouds in the sky, they will come and go. It's better to acknowledge all your feelings and let them go peacefully than it is to hold on and beat yourself up over having that one negative feeling that leads self loathing and destructive behaviour.\n\nOver the years I have seen many people struggle with their feelings and go down the road of self-destruction rather than face the fear head on. Don't give in to the fear, you are not alone.\n\nMany people think they're fine if they are rely 'just a little bit' on drink, drugs, sex and even food to get them through the worst. You are not ok, and that IS actually ok. Be hurt, cry even scream if it helps. Just don't bottle up those emotions, because if you do, I guarantee you will pop like a champagne cork when you least expect it.\n\n\u2022 Recruit your support team carefully...Do not disconnect.\n\nYou are not alone in your despair but it is important you select the right team of people to see you through. Very often, it's not your nearest and dearest that will get you through the dark times; it will be those that are emphatically bound to your situation and have been through it themselves.\n\nSometimes when you reach out you may find that those you thought would be there for you are nowhere to be seen. Or worst, they're not as supportive as you expected them to be. Sound familiar? I bet you were hurt and unable to fathom why they were so thoughtless and cold. The reason is quite simple, they were unable to help you. You must respect this, as what you're going through is part of your journey not theirs. You mustn't get bitter remembering all the times you helped them out, it's a waste of energy. Focus on finding those that can and will want to help you. You may be pleasantly surprised who you let into your life.\n\nIf you're more like me and prefer to brood on your own, I would strongly suggest you don't completely disconnect from the world. It can be dangerous to stay in your own head and trust me when I say the black void I always talk about; is very welcoming to those that seek solitude. Maybe select a few trusted individuals to tell and be clear how you want them to support you. This is want I have done and I can't even begin to explain how grateful I am to have the support I have. To those trusted few, thank you!\n\n\u2022 It's all about balance.\n\nI'm sure many of you have heard about the importance of having a healthy work/life balance right? Well when you're going through crisis, taking up a new (healthy) hobby can actually help you see beyond your problem and the black clouds overhead. But be careful not to use this new hobby to distract you from your problems altogether. As hard as it might be, you must give yourself time to adjust to your changing circumstances otherwise it will come back and haunt you for the rest of your life.\n\n\u2022 Don't let what happened dictate who you are.\n\nFinally, don't let what has happened to you completely define who you are as a person. You are so much more than that and have so much to give. When something life changing occurs, it can shatter your life into tiny pieces.\n\nObviously what has happened will permanently mark you; but instead of trying to piece your old life together try creating something more beautiful from the pieces left behind. Spend time getting to know yourself again; go out, explore and see what the world has to offer.\n\nAlways remember, beyond the black clouds the blue skies are always there...\n\nBy Chrystal Wanstall\n\nFounder of The Birch Hoven Project\n\nNote: Two months after writing this article my father sadly passed away 28th of August 2016.

The doctor checks your vitals, may take a sample of blood, discusses ways to improve your health, etc. You may feel relief as you believe the doctor is here to help navigate you through whatever ails you. But have you ever wondered what goes on in the mind of that highly educated person wearing a white lab coat and stethoscope?\n\nIn Abraham Verghese\u2019s New York Time\u2019s bestseller, The Tennis Partner, Verghese weaves a story that shows us how doctors are more than their persona. In the book, Verghese, a physician, becomes friends and tennis partners with David, a talented resident with a dark past of drug abuse and addiction. When the beast of addiction returns to haunt David, Verghese witnesses a complex human, resplendent with varying shades of emotions, emerge. \u201cThere I thought are so many David\u2019s: the retiring Aussie, the stylish tennis player, the downcast lover, the thoughtful friend, the mischievous Lothario, the recovering addict, the plodding medical student.\u201d\n\nAlthough Verghese came to see David as much more than his depression and addictions, his insecurities and self-effacement, in the end David overdoses and dies. Verghese reflects back on his friendship with David, and realizes it was a slow build, a toxic suicide manifested by the congruence of multiple mental health issues and addiction in which he attempted to manage all on his own.\n\nAs such, there are documented accounts of interns, residents and doctors who find their lives unbearable and in that final moment of despair take their own lives, leaving patients, family, loved ones, friends, co-workers, hospitals and practices bewildered.\n\nIn fact, \u201cmore than 920,000 Americans lose their doctors to suicide each year,\u201d writes Neil Ungerleider for Fast Company. And according to a recent New York Times article, \u201capproximately 400 doctors commit suicide yearly,\u201d and \u201cphysicians are more than twice as likely to kill themselves as non-physicians (and female physicians three times more likely than their male counterparts.)\u201d\n\nWhere do these alarming statistics come from? It\u2019s a confluence of issues. The educational demands, extended workdays, the demands of patient care which are both rewarding and exacerbating, chronic stress, lack of institutional emotional support, and the availability of addictive substances coupled with a \u201cconspiracy of silence\u201d which leads to underreporting or failure to report when a doctor is in trouble. This spider web of silence may be inadvertently perpetuated by families and co-workers, who fear that addressing the problem head-on or doing a compassionate loving invitational intervention may cause their loved one financial harm or increased work stress.\n\nPerhaps it begins in medical school. Long grueling hours of study and work, the 86-hour workweek, stress and anxiety take a toll. In her Ted Talk titled \u201cWhy Doctors Kill Themselves,\u201d Pamela Wible, MD, denounces the medical school culture of \u201chazing and bullying and name calling\u201d that continues into residency that results in \u201coccupational-induced depression, poorer health care for patients, and a professional culture that dissuades doctors from seeking health care.\u201d Furthermore, the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention indicates that \u201cdrivers of burnout include workload inefficiency, lack of autonomy and meaning in work and work-home conflict.\u201d\n\nThis culture continues through residency and culminates into a frame of mind that pits doctors at odds with reality. Pranay Sinha, a physician in his first year at Yale-New Haven Hospital, points out the mind-set. He writes in a New York Times op-ed there is a \u201cstrange machismo that pervades medicine. Doctors, especially fledgling doctors like me, feel pressure to project intellectual emotional prowess beyond what we truly possess. Our expectations skyrocket as if the conferral of a degree (MD) were an enchantment of infallibility. In fact very little changes, apart from our legal ability to prescribe medications.\u201c\n\nIn addition to rising pressures and a hubris culture, depression, as Dr. Robert Bright explains in his report published at Current Psychiatry, may be one of the leading contributors. Although the rate of depression amongst physicians is comparable to the general population, the risk of doctor suicide is higher. And the prevalence of depression among residents is higher than similarly aged individuals in the general US population. Finally, depression and other mood disorders amongst doctors may be under-recognized and inadequately treated due to:\n\nDoctors may be reluctant to seek treatment\n\nResidents and interns may have no time to seek treatment because of grueling work weeks\n\nDoctors may attempt to be their own doctor - they will diagnose and treat themselves (i.e. self medicate)\n\nDoctors have easy access to prescription drugs\n\nMay be fearful of stigma attached to mental health disorders\n\nDoctors if they do seek treatment may get VIP Treatment\n\nAdditionally, in their research, Bright and Kahn of the Mayo Clinic have discovered that rates of depression are higher in medical students and residents (15 to 30 percent) than in the general population. Some of the predictors of depression in doctors are:\n\nDifficult relationships with senior doctors, staff and or patients Lack of sleep Dealing with death Making mistakes Loneliness 24-hour responsibility Self-Criticism\n\nAs such, there are manifestations of mental illness in doctors according to Bright and Kahn that can create a negative impact on the health of our doctors.\n\nAs a therapist, clinician and addiction/mental health interventionist, when assessing risk for doctors in particular and the population in general it is important to do a robust bio-psycho\u2013social history and take a look at past family history and past history of the doctor in question as well as viewpoints on the work culture. Here are some questions to ask:\n\nIs there a family history of mental illness? Is there a family history of suicide? Has the doctor previously experienced a depressive episode? Has there been previous suicidal thoughts and/or attempts? Is there a family history of addiction and or process disorders? What is families\u2019 religious and cultural beliefs about mental health, substance abuse and suicide? Has the doctor had a history of addiction? What is the doctor\u2019s past experience with prescribed and non-prescribed mind-altering drugs? Has the doctor been treated for any addicted disease per ASAM\u2019s definition of addiction? Has the doctor been treated previously for anxiety or insomnia? Has the doctor had any learning disabilities that affect their learning style? What are his/her current relationships? How, if at all, are professional requirements affecting those? What are one\u2019s views on getting and seeking help (current and past family views)? What are one\u2019s personal and family religious or cultural views on mental illness, suicide, and substance misuse, drug addiction or process disorders, sex, shopping, gambling?\n\nSo what is being done to help the situation?\n\nTo help prevent what others have labeled the \u201cSilent Epidemic,\u201d Pranay Sinha, the first year resident mentioned above, passionately says, \u201cwe must be able to voice [our] doubts and fears. We must be able to talk about the sadness of the first death certificate we signed, the mortification of the first incorrect prescription we ordered, the embarrassment of not knowing an answer on rounds that a medical student knew.\u201d And if a fellow physician does commit suicide there must be protocols in place that allow for discussion, crisis intervention, and management of the situation.\n\nAs such, the first suicide prevention and depression awareness program was established at the University of California, San Diego in 2009 to destigmatize help-seeking and prevent suicide among medical student, residents and faculty physicians. The approach of the program consisted of screening, assessment, referral and education. The screening practice was trustworthy. The educational part consisted of grand rounds (a teaching tool whereby doctors, residents and medical students evaluate the medical problems and treatment for patients) on students\u2019 and physicians\u2019 exhaustion, depression, and suicide.\n\nToday the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP) has a robust list of resources on its website including videos, articles, interactive screening programs, etc. In addition, Pamela Wible, a physician in Eugene Oregon mentioned in the Ted Talk above, who was \u201cplagued\u201d with both doctors she dated in medical school killing themselves, her own previous thoughts of suicide, and the reality that 10 local Oregon doctors killed themselves, became a self-proclaimed advocate of this silent epidemic. She wrote a book about the topic of doctor suicide called Physician Suicide Letters in which she sheds light on the issue lurking in the shadows. Wible\u2019s goal is to make sure these facts get out into the public arena, and urges an examination of causation factors and preventative measures to be put in place.\n\nWhy is reading about Suicide and Doctors so important? aka The July Effect\n\nEvery summer a new cohort of medical graduates enters hospital wards. To be exact, 36,000 students applied for residency this year. There is a perceived increase in the risk of medical errors and complications that occurs in July and August because the new medical graduates don\u2019t talk about the pressures and climate of culture in residency. This has been labeled the July Effect. While not statistically proven, one surely can argue with the influx of a new generation of doctors comes an increase of stress, anxiety and suicide ideation. Recent medical school graduates step foot in teaching hospitals as residents for the first time, as the class above them takes on new duties.\n\nAs such, this year hospitals offered a record number of residency positions and more doctors will start their career than ever in the summer months. Overall, the number of residency positions offered hit a record high of 31,757, up more than a thousand from 2016, according to a report in Stat News.\n\nJust ask Anupam Jena, an internist and assistant professor of health care policy at Harvard medical school, who was interviewed for U.S. News & World Report. \u201cThe interns know less than the physicians who were there two or three months before.\u201d That is simultaneously scary and anxiety inducing!\n\nAs a licensed clinician and interventionist, I believe it is imperative for hospital systems on a macro level to have policies in place and to be trained on how to intervene with compassion and grace when one is experiencing mental health and substance abuse distress.\n\nIt is important to keep the doors of communication open and have policies and protocols that support wellness with respect to work hours, random drug testing, etc. and provide opportunities for treatment that is confidential, ethical and respectable.\n\nOur medical schools and teaching hospitals must learn the warning signs and take heed of them and must become well versed on treatment options available. Our doctors must enjoy the same confidentiality, respect, treatment that one would provide for a loved one. I for one am well-suited to work in tandem to provide tools and strategies for such discourses to take place and strategies to be implemented.\n\nTo learn more about Louise Stanger and her interventions and other resources, visit her website.\n\nOriginally published at www.huffingtonpost.com", "url": "https://www.thriveglobal.com/stories/11694-doctor-suicide-the-elephant-in-the-examining-room", "summary": "The doctor checks your vitals, may take a sample of blood, discusses ways to improve your health, etc.\nIn fact, \u201cmore than 920,000 Americans lose their doctors to suicide each year,\u201d writes Neil Ungerleider for Fast Company.\nAlthough the rate of depression amongst physicians is comparable to the general population, the risk of doctor suicide is higher.\nWhat is families\u2019 religious and cultural beliefs about mental health, substance abuse and suicide?\nShe wrote a book about the topic of doctor suicide called Physician Suicide Letters in which she sheds light on the issue lurking in the shadows.", "timescraped": 1513925484.896489, "category": {"words": 1804, "personal": 13, "thirdperson": 29, "condition": 19, "recovery": 0}}, "1ae6474e1f2333e74d0aa136c64e62a3": {"title": "How to Live More Wisely Around Our Phones \u2013 Thrive Global", "image": "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*xx2qEtcLq2KMyv2k.jpg", "text": "How to Live More Wisely Around Our Phones\n\nThe dark truth is that it\u2019s become very hard to find anyone (and certainly anything) more interesting than one\u2019s smartphone. This perplexing and troubling realisation has for most of us had huge consequences for our love stories, family lives, work, leisure time and health. There is almost no relationship in which the presence of the phone has not had a profound impact. The genuine beauty and interest of our phones wouldn\u2019t be a matter of such concern if we didn\u2019t suspect, somewhere in our minds, that this machine has both opened some doors and is in danger of grievously closing others. This essay knows we love our phones and would never want us to give them up, but it is also gently aware that these delightful gadgets bear a hidden cost. This is a text that aims to bring a little sanity to our closest, most intense and possibly most danger-laden technological relationship.\n\n1. Addiction\n\nWe might not be injecting illegal substances or dousing ourselves in alcohol, but we are almost all drug addicts of one kind or another. Addiction is (in essence) dependence on a substance that keeps our real hopes and fears at bay: it is (more broadly) any and every routine we deploy to avoid a fair and frank encounter with our own minds.\n\nTo say we are addicted to our phones is not merely to point out that we use them alot. It signals a darker notion: that we use them to keep our own selves at bay. Because of our phones, we may find ourselves incapable of sitting alone in a room with our own thoughts floating freely in our own heads, daring to wander into the past and the future, allowing ourselves to feel pain, desire, regret and excitement.\n\nWe are addicted to our phones not because we rely on them, but to the extent that we recruit them to a harmful project of self-avoidance. They do not mean to hurt us. But we may \u2014 and probably do \u2014 use them to injure ourselves. Addiction sounds horrible. But it is a hard name for a normal inclination: a habit of running away from the joys and terrors of self-knowledge.\n\n2. Monasticism\n\nFor centuries, Christian monks and nuns built remote, austere (and often very beautiful) places to live, frequently constructed round quiet arcades with tranquil gardens at their core. They went to such trouble because above all else, they were concerned about one thing: distraction. They were acutely aware of our native inability to get the best out of our minds: they understood how vague and jumpy our thoughts can be. And they took the problem of disturbance with utmost seriousness. They so wanted to concentrate on what was important to them, they took immense care to wall-off instantly alluring (but often frankly worthless) distractions offered by the wider and wilder world.\n\nTheir efforts are moving because \u2014 as we painfully realise \u2014 they were right. Our minds are by nature like mad monkeys, restlessly flitting from one fleeting diversion to another, while all the things we really care about get neglected. But tragically our society and culture does not build us cloisters: it places in our hands ever-open conduits to everything that could possibly divert our minds: real estate, porn, the news, social chit-chat, strident opinion, games, special offers, puzzles, the twelve best hotels somewhere, the weirdest doings of the weirdest strangers and the intimate lives of every celebrity on the planet. We are almost powerless to resist because so many clever, hard working people are devoting their lives to making money by capturing, if only for a few seconds, the most precious thing we possess: the focus of our minds \u2014 and our time. Even without the slightest feeling of religious conviction, we might pine for the cloister.\n\n3. The Digital Sabbath\n\nIn the Ten Commandments, we are told that God ordered the Israelites to do no work on the Sabbath (that is, the seventh) Day. It wasn\u2019t out of dislike of work. They were fully expected to toil away for the previous six days. Rather, it was a notion of the deep utility of rest that was being advocated. The injunction stems from a deeply wise view of human nature. We regularly need to stop \u2014 even when something is otherwise valuable to accomplish. And it helps if we are told to stop in a rather authoritative way, perhaps by someone in the sky with a beard. The concept of a digital Sabbath isn\u2019t Luddite in spirit; it\u2019s not denying that technology brings us enormous advantages or is dazzling in its accomplishments. It\u2019s recognising that we are over-obedient to our machines. We\u2019re too compliant by nature and therefore need to be reminded \u2014 with the utmost authority \u2014 that we must at points take a break.\n\nThe problem is that the gods have died. The great authorities of the modern world are the voices of corporate interests; they don\u2019t necessarily have our best needs at the front of their minds. We have to check our phones of course but we also need to engage directly with others, to be relaxed, immersed in nature and present. We need to let our minds wander off of their own accord. We need to go through the threshold of boredom to renew our acquaintance with ourselves. And we need to do this on a regular basis, perhaps one day a week, as the tribes of Israel cleverly realised a long time ago. We might designate every Saturday as the occasion when \u2014 for a while \u2014 we mute the tyrannical machine.\n\n4. Look things up inside yourself\n\nWe can look up so much on our phones: we can (if we are inclined) check up the population of Lima (8.473 million); who won the Ladies Final at Wimbledon in 1997 (Martina Hingis); the definition of \u2018tautology\u2019 (saying the same thing twice, though in different ways) or perhaps the author of that fascinating quote \u2018What you survive makes you stronger\u2019 (Nietzsche). Yet this constant resource has an unwitting, unfortunate side-effect. We consult our phones, rather than ourselves.\n\nIt\u2019s not that we actually know so many obscure facts. But we already possess \u2014 in scattered, unpolished forms \u2014 the raw material from which a huge number of the very best insights and ideas could be formed: if only we gave them enough time and attention. We already have immense experience \u2014 but it is not yet fully articulate; its lessons have not been formulated; the conclusions haven\u2019t been extracted.\n\nOften it\u2019s not more information we need but more ambitious use of the information we already possess. What makes for a genuinely enjoyable holiday? What, really, do I love about tennis? What do I need and want to say to my friends? The only instrument to use is our own brain. And there is, perhaps, only one quote we truly need to look up: \u2018In the minds of geniuses we discover our own neglected thoughts\u2019 (Ralph Waldo Emerson)\n\n5. Our phones and our relationships\n\nIn principle, we love family life and are very keen on and devoted to relationships. But, obviously, the reality is tricky. The wonderful things are mixed up with a lot that is awkward and frustrating. Our partner isn\u2019t quite as sympathetic as we\u2019d ideally like; our family is more conflicted and challenging than feels fair or reasonable.\n\nOur phone, however, is docile, responsive to our touch, always ready to spring to life and willing to do whatever we want. Its malleability provides the perfect excuse for disengagement from the trickier aspects of other people. It\u2019s almost not that rude to give it a quick check \u2014 just possibly we might actually need to keep track of how a news story is unfolding; a friend in another country may have just had a baby or someone we vaguely know might have bought a new pair of shoes in the last few minutes.\n\nIt\u2019s so tempting to press the screen when one\u2019s partner launches into an account of their day or their theory of ideal fridge management. The details of their existence and their hopes for our shared domestic life cannot compete with information about the most expensive apartment currently on sale in Manhattan or the diet of Mymains Stewart Gilligan (the largest pet cat in the world). Only the former will, in the long-run, be a lot more important \u2014 as we know.\n\n6. Dating\n\nWe can, it seems, hook up so easily. There are millions of people out there. It shouldn\u2019t be hard to find the right one \u2014 if only we sign up to the right site. We become monsters of our hopes: any person we have met is judged against those we haven\u2019t ever met. We are unforgiving towards those we know because of the vast reserves of surely ideal companions and partners currently separated from us only by a click or two.\n\nOf course, none of the people we do meet through our phones is in fact ever quite right. So we go back to the search and redouble our efforts. The treasure-mate must be there, if only we look for long enough.\n\nWe never do find them though \u2014 and for a tragic reason that our phones will not as yet own up to. Everyone out there is radically imperfect. The task of love can\u2019t be to locate some mythical \u2018right person\u2019. Compatibility is an achievement of love, it can\u2019t be its precondition. We\u2019ll have learnt how to form relationships only when we surrender our attachment to perfection and learn instead to tolerate and see the point of the trickier aspects of everyone we could ever meet.\n\nThis is a truth that our phone, as yet, doesn\u2019t want to teach us. It promises to locate someone who likes eating cheese, wants to wear a rubber mask and lives within a ten mile radius of Sevenoaks. But it cannot, as yet, help us with the real challenge of love: which is to extend sympathy and understanding to human frailty.\n\n7. Porn vs Real Life\n\nA love of porn is deeply understandable and our phones know it. The business of living is so desperately hard, relationships are so challenging, work often so unfulfilling or boring, family dynamics so tricky and the capacity for honest, kindly conversation so restricted, we may through no particular fault of our own end up extremely vulnerable to the sudden intense highs offered by sexting sessions or short films about lesbians trying anal or muscled hunks whipping each other. Porn doesn\u2019t judge, it doesn\u2019t criticise you for being fascinated by threesomes or the idea of kinky librarians. Instead of saying: you are revolting and disgusting, a porn site is welcoming and compassionate. It\u2019s offering online something we might ideally wish to get from another person: acceptance of the curious ways our libido happens to work.\n\nCloseness to a real life partner bring with it so many complications that militate against excitement. There\u2019s a backlog of unresolved resentments; there a daily need to put up with a person\u2019s less reasonable sides or to be apologetic for one\u2019s own failings; there\u2019s the pressure to be moderately respectable and civilized.\n\nAll of these are dampers on sexual exploration \u2014 and they fall away around porn. The porn site doesn\u2019t care if you didn\u2019t take the rubbish out or chewed a bit loudly; it doesn\u2019t mind that you slammed the cupboard door or gave a monosyllabic answer when asked how your days was; it doesn\u2019t want to go into detail about why you didn\u2019t ring your mother on her birthday or take you up on your attitude to credit card debt. Porn in effect says: we don\u2019t mind about anything else in your life \u2014 just concentrate on this for a bit. Porn can be \u2014 therefore \u2014 a huge relief from the burdensome complications of intimacy. It usefully \u2014 and blissfully \u2014 removes sex from the emotional landscape of our real relationships. Which is both an immense benefit \u2014 and a terrible hidden cost.\n\n8. Nature and the sublime\n\nAlmost since the beginning of time, we have prized the opportunity to get away from reminders of humanity and to immerse ourselves in nature. We have wanted to gaze on the grey indifference of the ocean or the bright, incalculable, immensity of the starry sky. We have loved to stand below towering cliffs or encounter in the flesh a tree that was planted when bison still roamed the plains. We long for the strange ennoblement \u2014 and emotional relief \u2014 that comes from recognising our own astonishing littleness in the infinite spaces of nature. These grand settings bring with them a profoundly consoling diminution of our cares: if we are so minor in the bigger scheme, so too must be our worries.\n\nOur phones are the enemies of such experiences. They keep intruding our small selves into the picture. We may be on the edge of the Grand Canyon; they are beeping in our back pockets. We may be gazing at the southern slopes of the Matterhorn; they are receiving updates for a food delivery app back home. They ask us never to forget our ego \u2014 and the endless things that ail us. Without meaning to, they strip away the help the grandeur of nature offers.\n\n9. Stimulation vs Calm\n\nFor reasons connected up with our own evolution as a species \u2014 reasons which have become tragic in the modern world \u2014 our brains crave stimulation. Once we were responding energetically to vital and serious signals from the environment about the prospect of eating a berry or of getting bitten by a snake; now, in the age of fridges and zoos we respond with equal (though deeply misplaced) urgency to anything that can prick our hyper-active fancy, however remote true sustenance or real danger may be.\n\nWe jump up at the slightest command. We\u2019re ever alert to new information \u2014 even when it\u2019s far from being connected up with anything that truly counts.\n\nOur most urgent need is for something that for millennia was of little concern to us: calm. We react to stimuli even when we\u2019re exhausted, worn down, over-agitated and frantic. And our phones have to accept a degree of blame \u2014 because they are the endless carriers of claims to rouse us, when what we really need is exactly the opposite: to be helped to be more serene and at peace.\n\n10. Shopping\n\nAbraham Maslow, The Pyramid of Needs\n\nIn our hands we hold access to (or at least information about) every product in the known universe. If we wake in the middle of the night and check our phones, we will probably be greeted by an offer from a shoe company, a supplier of flat-pack furniture or a maker of strangely expensive watches.\n\nNevertheless, the weird truth is that we\u2019re still rather bad at shopping. Not in the obvious sense that we miss a bargain or pay too much for a toaster or a pair of sandals. But rather that our purchasing ambitions are focused only at the lower level of our own pyramid of needs.\n\nOur phone doesn\u2019t know (and therefore cannot help us with) how much we\u2019d rather have a true friend than a cut-price chicken or find a solution to a long running relationship row rather than get a discount on our car insurance. As we struggle up the pyramid of needs, the bargains we need to strike, the commitments we need to make, the things we most require in (or out of) our lives pass over the heads of our sleek and perfectly styled \u2014 but ultimately impoverished \u2014 phones.\n\nWe are still waiting for phones that will help us properly address the greatest struggles of our lives, the ones at the summit of Abraham Maslow\u2019s famous pyramid.\n\n11. Beyond Instagram\n\nYou can take a photo of a leaf (or your lover\u2019s face or the house you lived in when you were five or a glacier cascading into the sea) but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve taken possession of this thing in your soul. It\u2019s only when we ask ourselves the detailed questions \u2014 is that side of the leaf darker or lighter than the other, how exactly does the stem join the twig, how many points are there in fact round the top portion? \u2014 that we start to notice the details and fix them in our minds.\n\nWe need to make ourselves pay attention. And ironically \u2014 tragically \u2014 the ease with which we can create an image works against our very desire properly to notice anything.\n\nWe may have to resort to a cruder mechanism to do a subtler thing: discover what something means to us.\n\nWe may need, at points, to put the phone down and sketch.\n\n12. Appreciation\n\nOur phones seem to deliver the world directly to us. Yet (without our noticing) they often limit the things we actually pay attention to. As we look down towards our palms we don\u2019t realise we are forgetting:\n\nThe curious delicacy of a friend\u2019s wrist\n\nThe soothing sound of traffic in the distance\n\nMoss on an old stone wall\n\nThe pleasure of feeling tired after working hard\n\nThe excitement of getting up very early on a summer\u2019s morning, in order to have an hour entirely to oneself.\n\nA bank of clouds gradually drifting across the sky\n\nThe texture and smell and colour of a ripe fig\n\nThe shy hesitancy of someone\u2019s smile\n\nHow nice it is to read in the bath\n\nThe comfort of an old jumper (with holes under the armpits)\n\nThey are all waiting for a little attention.\n\n13. Poetry\n\nWe have learned to link brevity to vacuity. Serious ideas, we suppose, must be transmitted in long and challenging texts. Twitter is as far as one can get from great works like Kant\u2019s The Critique of Pure Reason, Tolstoy\u2019s War and Peace or Plato\u2019s Republic.\n\nYet this is an educated delusion. You can conjure the deepest, sweetest and saddest truths in a few words.\n\nLife\u2019s but a walking shadow, a poor player, that struts and frets his hour upon the stage, and then is heard no more; it is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.\n\n[192 characters, tweeted by William Shakespeare, c.1606]\n\nDrink to me only with thine eyes,\n\nAnd I will pledge with mine;\n\nOr leave a kiss within the cup,\n\nAnd I\u2019ll not ask for wine.\n\n[128 characters, tweeted by Ben Jonson 1616]\n\nWhat need is there to weep over parts of life? The whole of it calls for tears.\n\n[79 characters, tweeted by Seneca 1st century AD]\n\nThe only people we can think of as normal are those we don\u2019t yet know very well\n\n[79 characters, tweeted 10 Aug 2012]\n\nPoetry is the smart name for an eternal, central task: to sum up a lessons of experience as briefly and memorably as possible.\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t take against brevity out of snobbery. We should just make sure we\u2019re using brief media to say the really big and important things.\n\n14. News\n\nKeeping up with the news sounds like one of the most serious of rationales for our devotion to our phones. We\u2019re not being rude or frivolous: we\u2019re tracking world events. Yet we are curiously unselective about what properly counts as \u2018news\u2019. News isn\u2019t merely something that\u2019s happened: there\u2019s a crucial, implied (yet easily ignored) addendum; it happened and we need to know about it.\n\nA lot of what happened is in fact entirely irrelevant to what we are trying to do on earth. Our modern idea of \u2018news\u2019 is falsely and also dangerously flattering. It imagines that all of us need to know everything that happened in the last day or hour anywhere in the world.\n\nBut in reality, from a personal point of view, (which is the one that counts) the really important news is just everything that is crucial for us to take note of in order to understand our own world and our place in it \u2014 even though these priorities might not seem important in a global context.\n\nThe real news for us today might be that we should probably give our mother a ring.\n\n15. Fear Of Missing Out\n\nThanks to our phone we\u2019re more exposed than ever to the alluring things others do: \u2018there was this great bar we all went to \u2026\u2019; \u2018she\u2019s getting married in a little country church\u2026\u2019; \u2018the sun is glinting on Sydney Harbour\u2026\u2019; the top after-party \u2026 amazing views \u2026 chic Brooklyn bar that locals love\u2026\u2019\n\nThere is so much we\u2019re not doing, not invited to, not part of. Our own lives, it naturally seems, are filled with the Fear Of Missing Out. We suffer the agonies of FOMO.\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to get a bit cynical. Maybe the hyped things are not all they\u2019re cracked up to be? Maybe everything is a bit rubbish?\n\nIt\u2019s more nuanced than this: we do indeed risk missing out. But there is a rather different list of things we might not get round to enjoying than the one our phones want us to focus on: getting to truly know our parents, learning to cope well with being alone; appreciating the consoling power of trees and clouds; discovering what our favourite pieces of music really mean to a friend, chatting to a seven year old child\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s not the notion of missing out that is the problem. It\u2019s our ideas of what we might be missing out on that counts \u2014 and that our phones unhelpfully skew.\n\n16. The Dream of being \u2018liked\u2019\n\nIt can feel desperately naive or narcissistic to admit it \u2014 but we really like being \u2018liked\u2019, we are genuinely moved by a message letting us know that Matteo from Wisconsin or Emile from Livorno wants to be our friend. These little words \u2018like\u2019 and \u2018friend\u2019 set off such deep and tender longings in our souls: warm, sympathetic, intelligent approval; the promise of gentle, heartfelt understanding. We\u2019re eager to find out more. And we\u2019re almost always disappointed. They are probably very nice people but they are not really offering the kind of kindness and closeness our imaginations had quickly and beautifully sketched.\n\nFor all their brevity, \u2018liking\u2019 and \u2018friendship\u2019 speak right to the heart of who we are. We are lonely creatures \u2014 though we might know plenty of interesting people. But others never quite know us exactly as we\u2019d wish to be known. The most elusive \u2014 that is the darkest, most complex and most lovely \u2014 parts of who we are remain isolated.\n\nOur momentary excitement when we get a message isn\u2019t shameful or ridiculous. It\u2019s a widely shared, yet secret, pang of hope: that our inner solitude will be pierced, that our troubles and joys will be truly understood by another; and that all the messages we wish to send to the world would be received and perfectly understood, at least by someone.\n\nWe should not be frightened or discomfited by our pervasive loneliness. At an exasperated moment, near the end of his life, the German writer Goethe, who appeared to have had a lot of friends, exploded bitterly: \u2018No one has ever properly understood me, I have never fully understood anyone; and no one understands anyone else.\u2019\n\nIt was a helpful outburst from such a great man. It isn\u2019t our fault: a degree of distance and mutual incomprehension isn\u2019t a sign that life has gone wrong. It\u2019s what we should expect from the very start.\n\nIn any case, loneliness makes us more capable of true intimacy if ever better opportunities do come along. It heightens the conversations we have with ourselves, it gives us a character. We don\u2019t repeat what everyone else thinks. We develop a point of view. We might be isolated for now, but we\u2019ll be capable of far closer, more interesting bonds with anyone we do eventually locate.\n\nLoneliness is simply a price we may have to pay for holding on to a sincere, ambitious view of what companionship must and could be.\n\n17. Travel\n\nOur phones seem like the most useful holiday assistants: they\u2019ll show us how to get to the Duomo from the pensione or locate the fashionable but inexpensive bistro; they\u2019ll book the taxi ride. They can record \u2014 and reveal to others \u2014 the defective bathroom tiles in the rented villa or let everyone we know share our surprise at the actual appearance of the dish of green papaya with sliced pig\u2019s ear we ordered at Quan An Ngon in Ho Chi Minh City,\n\nBut as yet our phones are skimming the surface of our travel needs. They don\u2019t really know who we are and what we care about, because we\u2019re not as yet able to confess to them \u2014 in any productive way \u2014 the secrets of our hearts. And they can\u2019t as yet help us to tell those we love (but who weren\u2019t there) what it was really like for us.\n\nHalf-formed thoughts are circulating on our minds as we catch site of the Pyramids or walk through the doors of Harrods for the first time. But while our phones can record the moment they can\u2019t \u2014 as yet \u2014 bring our submerged reactions to the surface. They can tell us what time the museum opens but not why we \u2014 uniquely, we \u2014 should go there.\n\n18. Playing\n\nYou can play on your own \u2014 all too easily. On the screen, it\u2019s entrancing, fast, continuous and you are effortlessly moved from one stage to the next.\n\nBut \u2018playing\u2019, that is, being silly and having fun, with other people is different: a child\u2019s raucous glee when things turn their way; the unexpected intensity of fooling around with a normally staid and measured acquaintance; the pleasure of losing at snap to a shy five-year old; the constructive oddity of seeing someone you are normally a bit intimidated by tumbling on the grass after a successful tackle; the unexpected, but deeply welcome, intimacy of being on the same side in a water-pistol fight with the brother-in-law you\u2019d like to know better.\n\nWhen we play around with others, we are safely revealing less obvious, but very real, parts of who we are. Our mature, carefully composed work-selves are irrelevant as we inflate the paddling pool; it doesn\u2019t matter how the stock-market is doing while we happily loose at chequers to an elderly neighbour (with a surprisingly inventive storehouse of swear words); or as we see the smile (familiar from childhood) appear again in the older face of our mother as she turns down her winning poker hand.\n\nAnd all the time, as we play for real, we\u2019ve forgotten to check our phones.\n\n19. Selfies\n\nInstead he was looking closely at who he was and what he had become: contemplating the sadness that gradually accumulated in his own face, trying to work out what he really made of being alive: what has life done to me? What have I done with my time on earth? He wasn\u2019t seeking the approval of others, he was seeking self-knowledge.\n\nWhen something (like taking selfies) seems a little trivial or silly, it\u2019s tempting to think we should take it less seriously; we should distance ourselves from it and see it in a mocking light. But the wiser move might be to get much more ambitious. The art of a selfie may have a long way to go yet.\n\n20. Communication\n\nThe quaint (but oddly magnificent) word \u2018telephone\u2019 is built around an intensely poignant notion: communication at a distance. It holds out a promise: that one\u2019s solitary voice, sent out into the ether, can find a receptive, sympathetic ear. The phone massively multiplies our opportunities for contact, but doesn\u2019t itself make it easier to say what we need to or to get others to properly comprehend what it is we are really trying to tell them.\n\nTechnology annihilates physical but not psychological, distance. One\u2019s words effortlessly bounce off a satellite then stall when they reach the brain of the person we most hope will receive them with full understanding.\n\nOur technology is still so primitive. Our words move infinitely faster than a carrier pigeon or a scroll bearing slave but we are as yet no better at explaining ourselves than we were in early history.\n\nThere should, and will one day be, another technology that assists us in putting into words our secret sorrows and tentative hopes in such a way that they can properly be grasped, shared and responded to by others. This tool will intelligently prompt us to formulate more clearly our own concerns and support the skills we need to express ourselves in ways that pierce the defences of others.\n\nThe phones of the future will, finally, allow one heart to speak to another.\n\n22. Death\n\nWe constantly use our phones to keep track of our appointments. But we are \u2014 if we think about it \u2014 quite constrained around the things to which we choose to be alerted. There\u2019s the automated reminder of the session with the dentist; the alert to jog our memories that it\u2019s our parent\u2019s anniversary or the text message to let us know we\u2019re due to play a tennis match on Sunday afternoon.\n\nBut there are other \u2014 very different \u2014 appointments we need to keep in mind.\n\nWe need reminders to keep appointments with ourselves: we need to spend time with our own worries, to understand them rather than just suffer the anxiety they create.\n\nThe grandest (and much the worst) is our final appointment: with death. We don\u2019t know how many days we have left to count down. But what we need reminding of is not the day and the hour but the fact. Ideally we\u2019d get a message every morning: Memento, homo, quia pulvis es, et in pulverem reverteris. Remember you are made of dust and and will be dust again.\n\nBrevity, sadly, is the key to appreciation. It is when we remember death that we understand properly the urgency of making the best use of the days that remain.\n\n23. Utopia\n\nOur phones seem amazingly sophisticated: small miracles of compressed, practical science, working hand in hand with advanced Capitalism. We think so highly of them because we compare them to the past, rather than to the possibilities of the future. They are so much more advanced than any device we could possess twenty or forty years ago. Yet they are almost unbearably primitive, in comparison with what \u2014 ideally \u2014 the long future will bring.\n\nWe are still so far from inventing the technology we really require for us to flourish; capitalism has delivered only on the simplest of our needs. We can summon up the street map of Lyons but not a diagram of what our partner is really thinking and feeling; the phone will help us follow fifteen news outlets but not help us know when we\u2019ve spent more than enough time doing so; it emphatically refuses to distinguish between the most profound needs of our soul and a passing fancy.\n\nIn the Utopia, our phones will be wiser than we are. They will be kind and not merely subservient. They will know how to edge us away from a stupid decision and how to summon up our better natures.\n\nWe deserve pity for having been born in such primitive times.", "url": "https://journal.thriveglobal.com/how-to-live-more-wisely-around-our-phones-f4a85aaefb02", "summary": "To say we are addicted to our phones is not merely to point out that we use them alot.\nOur phones and our relationshipsIn principle, we love family life and are very keen on and devoted to relationships.\nWe never do find them though \u2014 and for a tragic reason that our phones will not as yet own up to.\nPorn vs Real LifeA love of porn is deeply understandable and our phones know it.\nPorn doesn\u2019t judge, it doesn\u2019t criticise you for being fascinated by threesomes or the idea of kinky librarians.", "timescraped": 1513925488.575406, "category": {"words": 5122, "personal": 299, "thirdperson": 69, "condition": 1, "recovery": 0}}, "3efb3837c12578f4bb50181818281bf7": {"title": "12 Simple Tips to Sleep Better and Improve Your Life", "image": "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*LX3dCfa3XeYZ-U4QXBV42A.jpeg", "text": "Catching Those Z\u2019s: 12 Tips To Sleep Your Way To The Top\n\nHow To Make Sleep Work for You.\n\nSleep can be a dirty word. It can be something you struggle to find the time for, something you don\u2019t get to enjoy because of all the clutter in life leading up to the point that you get to lay your head down, or it can be something you see as lazy. An indulgence that you can\u2019t afford because you\u2019ve got mouths to feed and a roof to keep over their head. That is dangerous and incorrect. You might think that you\u2019re maximising your productivity by getting as little sleep as you can get away with but it can affect every aspect of every thing that you do. Having a hard-work ethic isn\u2019t a bad thing, but having an approach to sleep that is just as hard is only going to prove dangerous in both the its short and long-term effects. Changing your attitude and behavior towards sleep is simple, straight-forward and rewarding.\n\nAccording to a study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 1 in 3 of us suffers from poor sleep, which can affect your overall health and make you prone to serious medical conditions, such as obesity, heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes. Your risk of injury and accidents at home, work and on the road also increases. Chronic lack of sleep over a prolonged time can lead to conditions like depression and anxiety, reduced sex drive, high blood pressure, decrease in fertility and increase in weight. And that\u2019s on top of well-known facts like increased irritability, slower reaction times and clouded judgment.\n\nSo, if you can combat that by keep better sleeping hours, you will be fitter, smarter, nicer to be around, funnier, sexier and most importantly: healthier. You can get more done during the day because your energy levels are right where they should be and you aren\u2019t constantly reminding yourself of how tired you feed. And substituting caffeine even alcohol for real energy is not a long term strategy that you can safely rely on as it interrupts regular sleeping patterns. There\u2019s just no alternative or way around the benefits of a good night\u2019s sleep.\n\nWe\u2019ve all put ourselves through times where we weren\u2019t getting enough sleep, I\u2019ve been there and so have you. There are so many responsibilities, pressures and distractions that keep us from a good bed time. It might be kids, work or just that new TV series on Netflix. However pressing the reasons might seem, you\u2019re much better equipped to handle them as a well-rested person. So here\u2019s some tips to help you get there.\n\n1. Make a To-Do List\n\nOrganise the next day and prioritise what you have to do. This will help focus your thoughts and prepare you for the day ahead. Stick to it as much as you can and try to do this every day, or have a set list for week days to try and maximise your time and meet targets and goals.\n\n2. Set A Cut-Off Point With Work\n\nGet into the habit of allowing yourself a maximum of an hour or two to finish up whatever work you might have to do and leave it at that. Agreeing a set time with yourself for when you will stop can help you to prioritise what you have to do and what is most important. When you reach that point, close your laptop and call it a day.\n\n3. Time With The Family\n\nEnjoy a meal together and share the days events with each other. Spending time with your family is important and for you just as much as it is them. Discuss things, laugh together, help with homework and be a part of each other\u2019s lives. Make some memories with your family and find escape from the daily grind of work by engaging with them about their day. Going out can be fun and it doesn\u2019t need to be expensive. You can go to the park together or see a sight or two. It can help distract your mind from the activities of the working day to remove yourself from your regular scenery.\n\n4. Have A Nice Warm Bath\n\nHygiene is something that should always be attended to and why not make it as enjoyable as possible? Splurge a little on bath products and make the most of it. Make it an experience. Listen to some music, an audiobook or simply enjoy silence- just try not to fall asleep in the tub. Give yourself the time to enjoy a bath. This helps your body relax and enables easier sleep as you cool down from the warm temperature \u2014 about an hour and a half after a bath is the optimum time to take advantages of its relaxing effects and sleep.\n\n5. Cut-off Time for Food and Drink\n\nMake sure that you aim to stop eating a couple of hours before sleep and no liquids an hour before you sleep (at least) to reduce the chances of you needing to get up during the night. Get all you need before then and draw the line there. Make sure you\u2019ve had enough to eat and have had a healthy balanced meal that won\u2019t upset your stomach during the night (especially if you have to share your bed with a partner).\n\nIt\u2019s also worth stressing that caffeine and alcohol should be avoided as much as possible (aside from a glass with dinner or when you get home) as these will only disrupt natual inclinations your body will have to sleep.\n\n6. Relaxation Time\n\nIt\u2019s vital to wind down. We all have sleep rituals that we do to help us relax and get into the less active mode our bodies and minds need to be able to turn off. This might be reading or watching some television or doing a hobby. It just matters that it\u2019s nothing too taxing that you find relaxing. Give yourself a couple of hours to yourself to do something you want to do.\n\n7. Dimming the Lights\n\nTurning down the light levels leading up to sleep will help your body to recognise that it\u2019s not daytime and that you needn\u2019t be as active. Candles are great for this, and lamps are good too. Just avoid any bright and glaring light. Making that transition from an active day into a restful night is a sensory voyage.\n\n8. Sex\n\nSex helps release endorphins which will help you sleep better, which is something we have evolved to do over time, as well as provide a good bit of cardio and fun. I don\u2019t really think I need to sell this point to you too much. It\u2019s a great release from tensions, pressures and is good for any healthy and caring relationship. However you like to do it is up to you, variety is the spice of life and whatnot. Masturbation is the alternative and there\u2019s nothing wrong with doing it yourself, on your own schedule and in the way your want.\n\n9. Turning Off the Phone\n\nTurn off your notifications (if not the phone itself) so that you won\u2019t be disturbed. You aren\u2019t a slave to your devices and don\u2019t have to obey it or pick it up just because it makes a sound. Allow yourself freedom from the outside world. The fewer glaring screens you\u2019re subject to in the hours leading up to sleep the better. Their light is unnatural and focusing on them can disrupt our natural circadian rhythms. Leave your phone outside your room if you can so that you aren\u2019t tempted to check in on it, keep it out of reach. Technology can be a distraction from your sleep schedule.\n\n10. Go To Sleep Earlier\n\nHowever early you think you can allow yourself to sleep, aim for an hour earlier and try doing this for a few days. Give yourself more time than you think you need to sleep so that you can enjoy it more and feel less pressured and hurried. When you have to be up early the clock can seem like a countdown. Be generous with yourself. The earlier you get to sleep, the earlier you\u2019ll be awake and can enjoy breakfast and your shower in the morning. Taking time to enjoy things is less stressful than having to hurry through them, so why not give yourself that time?\n\n11. Napping\n\nTake any opportunity to catch up on sleep and recharge. Any few hours you can grab can be very therapeutic, especially in the middle of a busy day. Even if it\u2019s just half an hour or an hour to just lay down quietly with your eyes closed, this can greatly boost your energy levels and productivity. You can do it at lunch or when you get home. Treat yourself to it. You\u2019ll be a much happier person and more fun to be around by taking the time to relax and de-stress. It allows your brain to sort through and digest events. Meditation can also be a fantastic thing to learn and practice.\n\n12. Invest In Your Sleep\n\nMake the effort to make your bedroom into a palace of sleep. Relaxing colours, artwork, scents can all greatly help. Make sure your bed is comfortable and something that you can look forward to climbing into at night. Good quilts, duvets, pillows and mattress are something that is worth spending good money on", "url": "https://journal.thriveglobal.com/12-simple-tips-to-sleep-better-and-improve-your-life-7bdb3a05b28e", "summary": "Catching Those Z\u2019s: 12 Tips To Sleep Your Way To The TopHow To Make Sleep Work for You.\nThere\u2019s just no alternative or way around the benefits of a good night\u2019s sleep.\nWe\u2019ve all put ourselves through times where we weren\u2019t getting enough sleep, I\u2019ve been there and so have you.\nThe fewer glaring screens you\u2019re subject to in the hours leading up to sleep the better.\nGo To Sleep EarlierHowever early you think you can allow yourself to sleep, aim for an hour earlier and try doing this for a few days.", "timescraped": 1513925491.069608, "category": {"words": 1547, "personal": 11, "thirdperson": 7, "condition": 1, "recovery": 0}}, "627898e23f621d66a66012b428b9d0a9": {"title": "Thrive Global", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/skinner-production/stories/featured_images/000/014/835/preview/london-scout-41030.jpg?1507680512", "text": "Jason Thomas is a Licensed Educational Psychologist and Mindfulness Teacher in Los Angeles.

That doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ve forgotten why I started my blog in the first place as raising awareness for Periventricular leukomalacia will always be my ultimate goal. You can read my 10 things to know about PVL. Yet since sharing my journey through Postnatal depression even though sometimes it\u2019s challenging it\u2019s been so rewarding.\n\nI thought I\u2019d share what I\u2019ve learnt in the few short months.\n\nWith sharing comes Freedom\n\nThe stigma of depression means that it can be really tough to talk about. You probably know somebody who has struggled with or still struggling with mental illness, and if you don\u2019t it\u2019s likely because society has made depression, Anxiety and other mental health issues taboo. Instead of keeping it a secret from others and sometimes from ourselves talking about it gives those scary and relentless thoughts an outlet. Opening the door for support from others. It\u2019s important to have the space to digest those thoughts, to work through them and look at them from a different perspective. Writing so honestly about my mental health and even my daughter\u2019s disability feels somewhat therapeutic and something I credit in aiding with my recovery. Once the words were out of my head I felt a huge pressure had been lifted. My blog although shared publicly online is mine, it\u2019s my little corner where I can express my thoughts and feelings.\n\nFriendships\n\nWhen I started blogging I had no idea how big the Blogosphere really was. Now I\u2019ve made incredible friendships with people not only across the U.K. But the world. I receive amazing comments daily and I\u2019m honestly honoured people find comfort in my pieces I write and want to open up to me.\n\nOpportunities\n\nEvery person who writes a blog has multiple thoughts when hitting the publish button, one is \u201cWho is really going to want to read this\u201d? I thought the exact same thing. Yet within my first 6 months I\u2019d achieved 50,000 views it\u2019s nothing compared to the big blogs out their but it\u2019s something to me! Now I have various pieces of my writing published with some amazing online journals. Recently being asked for my work to be published with a mental health magazine.\n\nI became courageous\n\nThe more honestly I wrote the more courageous I became with accepting and sharing my story. Being able to talk about it and know that even through all the darkness that was Depression I found the light. The most powerful things about sharing my story of mental illness are that not only did it allow people to see they are not alone in this suffering, but it\u2019s helped other people be courageous. It\u2019s helped other people share their story!\n\nIt has the power to transform your life\n\nI\u2019m not saying you\u2019re going to make millions and a book deal. More in the way you\u2019re personal life will change. It\u2019s enabled me to do what I love, to find a true passion that is writing, helping others and raising awareness. That is the best reward for myself. Often a blog is where people turn to when things get tough. A blog post can be that one thing that changes someone\u2019s perspective.\n\nBE BRAVE\n\nDO WHAT YOU LOVE\n\nMAKE A DIFFERENCE\n\nMake sure you check out my Happiness & Mindfulness Pinterest board.

I remember in high school, one of my friends used to say, \u201cYour problem is that you think too much.\u201d\n\nOf course, at the time I didn\u2019t think it was a problem\u2026.\n\nuntil it became a problem.\n\nSo what is rumination?\n\nAccording to this article, \u201cWhen people ruminate, they over-think or obsess about situations or life events, such as work or relationships. Research has shown that rumination is associated with a variety of negative consequences, including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder.\u201d\n\nI used to be such a pro at ruminating, I didn\u2019t just ruminate for myself\u2026I also ruminated for others! For instance, once I had a colleague who went through a publicly embarrassing experience. I thought I was empathizing when I mentioned, \u201cThat was really bad\u2026I\u2019m sorry about that\u2026\u201d\n\nBut then I kept on mentioning the scene over and over until they were annoyed and stopped me. Basically, they were already over it, why did I keep on bringing it up?\n\nThat was when I realized I had a problem.\n\n\u201cHi\u2026My nickname is AH, and I\u2019m a chronic ruminator.\u201d\n\nSo here are some practical strategies that have helped me overcome this;\n\n1. The 5 minute rule. Give yourself 5 minutes to whine about it. Whether you\u2019re complaining to a friend or journaling about it, set some boundaries around how long you\u2019ll let that thought play around in your mind. This strategy helps with Analysis Paralysis. Give yourself time to process and digest what just happened, extract whatever lessons you learned from it, and after that, don\u2019t think about it again.\n\n2. Get out of your head by calling someone. This is quite effective. When you\u2019re stuck in a mental loop, reaching out to someone else suddenly turns your mental thoughts away from your life and your problems to their life and their problems. Even if you don\u2019t call them to listen to their problems, and instead call them to rant, they can actually change your perspective about the whole thing. For example, the other day I was upset over something and I called my older brother. While talking, he launched into a story that went something like this,\n\n\u201cLet me tell you about the time I was doing my Senior Design Project\u2026\u201d\n\nOh God! Here we go.\n\n\u201cI was working on the project and then I got stuck\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the deadline was rapidly approaching\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then my laptop crashed\u2026\u201d\n\nOf course, there I was listening, wondering, \u201cWhere is this story going? Is it supposed to make me feel better?\u201d\n\nAnyhow, he ended with, \u201cI had to start the work over but I did get past that point where I was stuck.\u201d\n\nMy personal takeaway was more along the \u201cBackup your work\u201d lesson, but you get the picture\u2026Sometimes someone else can change your perspective so you break out of the mental loop.\n\nImage courtesy of Unsplash\n\n3. Do something else. No, no, don\u2019t think about doing something else. Physically get up and do something else. Whether it\u2019s going out for a run or cleaning the room or engaging in some other activity. This is more effective when the action you\u2019re taking is demanding enough to engage many of your senses and pushes you into a state of flow so you really can\u2019t spare any cognitive effort thinking about that thing.\n\n4. Remember that people don\u2019t think about you as much as you think they think about you. There\u2019s as portion of rumination that starts with us thinking about other people\u2019s opinions about us. \u201cI did something stupid and now all those people will think I\u2019m stupid.\u201d However, recognize that \u201cthose people\u201d don\u2019t really think about you that much. They have their own problems, and your life problems are the least of their concerns.\n\n5. Notice when you\u2019re doing it. Build enough self-awareness in your life to actually notice when you\u2019re stuck in a mental loop. Some people wear bracelets or have post-its to remind them to provide visual reminders to stop and think, \u201cAm I stuck in a mental loop? Is it helping me?

Below are some of the life lessons I took away from our conversation.\n\n\u201cDefinitely drank and used because of childhood trauma.\u201d\n\nMegan was and has always been quite spiritual but struggled to go between the light and the darkness. I think we go through some version of light versus dark and then have to make a choice when the darkness gets to be too much. As Megan suggested we all have to go through our own version of The Hero\u2019s Journey and we have to remember we have the power to find the good in our story and provide value to others as a result of finding this good.\n\n\u201c Anyone who is striving to awaken must go through\u2026\u201d\n\nIt was interesting to have a guest on the show speak about the power of the 12 Steps. We have had some guest that don\u2019t align with them, but Megan has been working them for years and believes they are the foundation for spirituality. Before, she would only make it to around 6 months of sobriety. But once she finally became \u201cspiritually bankrupt\u201d, she came out the other side.\n\nShe takes a daily inventory of her resentments which naturally occur. \u201cOn a day to day bases, you just clean it up\u201d. Taking responsibility for your part in any situation, rather than being a victim or blaming the other person. This was key to her recovery because it is resentments that cause us to drink.\n\n\u201cWe are her co-creating our reality with the other people around us.\u201d\n\nWe also spoke about the power of meditation to help your recovery and the fact you are not your thoughts. Suggesting this separation can help you reprogram some of your neural pathways.\n\nWe went on to talk about being sober and the struggle to have \u201cfun\u201d. Megan said she wasn\u2019t having fun, she does not date and leads a rather quiet life.\n\nI said in the interview, we need to consider exchanging fun for fulfillment and give back to the world from the pain we have endured.

In the middle of a conference call, my face drooped and I felt dizzy so was rushed to hospital for a scan. It turned out not to be a stroke but after repeat incidents of these weird seizures, we eventually found out I had burnt my brain by bingeing on cortisol, the stress hormone. It took me the best part of six months out of the office to get these seizures under control and resume normal life. Having now been back at work for nearly five months, I find it absolutely astonishing that I didn't see my very own burnout coming - the writing was on the wall in bold big letters and I seem to have missed it altogether... But then again, I'm not alone: 52% of UK employees claim to have experienced one or more symptoms of overwork or burnout in the last six months.\n\nI clearly won't be able to reverse the burnout epidemic with a blog post but in case it helps some of you stay away from the dark side, here are my six signs you could be heading for burnout, delivered to you on the first birthday of my very own meltdown. I learnt them the hard way so that you don't have to.\n\n1. You are the burnout type\n\nSome of us are more burnout prone than others. If you are a perfectionist or an insecure overachiever type, I'm afraid you have more tickets in the burnout lottery than the average punter. Make sure you watch for what is called the \"Burnout Cycle\". Are you feeling a compulsion to prove yourself? Have you set your personal expectations so high that you're taking more and more work to support your inner notion of irreplaceability and to get some extra pats on your insecure head? Be careful, as eventually you are highly likely to end up dismissing your own needs for critical elements like sleep, exercise, food, friends and fun as the ultimate sacrifice to prove your heroic performance.\n\n2. Your body is packing up\n\nAre you feeling exhausted all the time? Even after a decent night's sleep? Are you catching every illness that is going round the office? These are sure signs that you have started to take your body too far and that you are compromising your immune system through overexertion.\n\n3. Your mind is on overdrive\n\nAre you struggling to sleep because your head is spinning with thoughts? Do you catch yourself lost in relentless mind chatter in the middle of the day? Do you feel distracted and unable to focus? Have you become more forgetful than normal? When your mind is overactive, it's probably replaying past events or getting angry/upset/stressed about events in future. This over-activation of your fight or flight response is called allostatic load and it's basically wear and tear on your brain and body which in the short term can lead you to burnout and in the long-term it can affect your metabolism, your immune system, and also the aging of your DNA. Not fun.\n\n4. You're acting weird\n\nAre you a little bit more cutting than normal? Does everyone around you irritate you? Do you have a little bit of a shorter fuse? Are you a bit jumpy and jittery? Are you bingeing on alcohol or food or completely starving yourself? If you're catching yourself reacting poorly to things that you'd normally take on your stride and displaying more extreme and addictive behaviours, you're definitely headed for a crash. Also, if people around you are starting to notice and confront you and you feel offended or just fend them off with a cutting \"I'm fine\", you're probably already there.\n\n5. You feel guilty, overwhelmed and helpless\n\nAre you procrastinating more than normal? Are tasks taking you significantly longer than they should? Are you cramming your diary with work and social events only to feel overwhelmed and cancel at the last minute? Are you feeling guilty because you can't do everything you should and letting everyone down? Do you feel completely out of control and like nobody understands and can help you? Yup, seems like you have got one foot on dark side...\n\n6. But you can't stop\n\nSo your body has packed up, your brain is exhausted, you're acting out and you're on the brink of having a full blown meltdown... Yet, you get up the next day and you do it all again. Do you feel like you'd be letting people down? Or that you'd be letting yourself down? Do you feel like stopping would be a sign of weakness or vulnerability? Probably a bit of all of the above would be my guess...\n\nI had all those six signs staring right into my eyes and I ignored them so I completely understand if you're doing the same, being a human ostrich burying your head in the sand and pretending that it will all go away. And it may well do! But then again it may not and you may find yourself in the middle of a big crash that it could take you months to recover from. Listen to your body and your mind. Watch your behaviour towards yourself and others. And make an intervention on yourself or let others intervene before it's too late. As much as it's given me great stuff to write about burning out isn't fun. It not only trashes your body and your brain but it wreaks havoc with your self-esteem and it can be very damaging to your relationships too. So watch out for those six signs and stop yourself from coming over to the dark side...\n\nKeep it balanced team - work hard and stay well.

Both of these things are true. Many proponents of positive thinking suggest denying the first reality and immediately replacing a negative thought with a more uplifting one. As well intentioned as this advice may be, this isn\u2019t an effective way to create a deep, lasting sense of peace. Denying your feelings doesn\u2019t make them go away. Many times, it only exacerbates them. A healthier approach may be to let those difficult feelings be \u2014 acknowledge them, make space for them, honor them \u2014 and also take time to nurture more positive feelings. It\u2019s not if/or; it\u2019s both. The beauty of this approach is that accepting life\u2019s hardships lessens their grip on us. It\u2019s like one of those Chinese finger traps; as soon as you stop fighting it, you\u2019re free.\n\nHow can we nurture more positive feelings on a daily basis? The quickest route I know is through gratitude. No matter what our circumstances, we can all find things to appreciate in our life. It might be something small, like having a good meal or getting a seat on a crowded bus. Or it could be something of greater magnitude \u2014 that you get to come home to a family that loves you or that you\u2019re working a job that you find fun and meaningful, that allows you to support yourself. Regardless of what you choose to acknowledge and appreciate, you\u2019ll experience the same benefits. Of course, it\u2019s easier to recognize our blessings when things are going well, but we often need gratitude the most when we feel least able to access it.\n\nI haven\u2019t always been quick to recognize the blessings in difficult situations, and I\u2019ve often focused more on what\u2019s going wrong than what\u2019s going right. This tendency did little to help me when I was struggling with major depression as an adolescent and young adult. But through years of practice I have become far more cognizant of everything worth appreciating \u2014 and I am happier, more optimistic and resilient, and better for the people around me as a result.\n\nThat\u2019s the power of gratitude: When you make a conscious effort to appreciate all the good around you, and sometimes, the silver lining of the not so good, your life \u2014 and your brain \u2014 will slowly transform. Yes, your brain. Preliminary studies have shown that regularly practicing gratitude actually primes our brains to experience it more often, almost like a muscle getting stronger with use. This means we are more apt to continue experiencing the many other positive benefits. If practiced regularly, gratitude can help us do the following:\n\n\u2022 Increase our happiness, self-esteem, and overall well-being\n\n\u2022 Nurture hope, optimism, and resilience\n\n\u2022 Reduce envy, stress, anxiety, insecurity, and other draining emotions\n\n\u2022 Intensify feelings of love, connection, and empathy and, consequently, strengthen our relationships\n\n\u2022 Boost our energy and our immune systems\n\n\u2022 Improve the quality of our sleep\n\n\u2022 Ultimately, increase our life-span, since all of the aforementioned benefits strengthen us physically and psychologically\n\nGratitude is a free, easily accessible way to feel better about yourself, your relationships, and your life. You can practice it anywhere, at any time; and with only a few moments out of your day, it can completely transform your experience of the world. One of the simplest ways I\u2019ve found to do this is through daily gratitude journaling \u2014 jotting down a few things, no matter how big or small, that you appreciated throughout your day or about your life in general. This journal will enable you to do that, but with some creative direction.\n\nFor maximum effectiveness, it\u2019s best to use this journal daily so that you get into a habit of noticing and recording what you appreciate, but you don\u2019t need to work through each page chronologically. You can jump forward, color at any time, or choose to ignore or alter the prompts and questions if they don\u2019t feel relevant to you. Make this book your own, and use it however feels fun and right for you.\n\nThis book is your refuge from the inevitable hardships in life. It\u2019s a place to celebrate what\u2019s beautiful, interesting, inspiring, and good in your world. You might not see this goodness easily at first, but over time, as you keep picking up your pen or markers, you\u2019ll start recognizing a whole lot more of it \u2014 and armed with a new sense of calm, confidence, and connectedness, you\u2019ll start creating a whole lot more of it, too.\n\nPROMPTS:\n\nWhat\u2019s the best thing that has happened to you today so far, and what did you most appreciate about it?\n\nLook around your current environment. What are three things you appreciate about where you are right now? What\u2019s beautiful, calming, stimulating, or otherwise worth appreciating?\n\nFrom TINY BUDDHA\u2019S GRATITUDE JOURNAL: Questions, Prompts, and Coloring Pages for a Brighter, Happier Life.

Research shows nearly three-quarters of business owners have concerns about their mental health. Almost half have struggled with depression or anxiety before.\n\nSociety tends to glorify success and achievement. We shy away from talking about mental health due to the fear and stigma attached to it.\n\nThankfully, that\u2019s changing. More top business leaders are coming forward about their battles with bipolar disorder, substance abuse, and OCD. The culture of silence around mental illness in the business community is beginning to shatter and with it, the shame of seeking help.\n\nIf you\u2019re struggling to cope with ups and down of the entrepreneurial roller coaster, first and foremost understand that you\u2019re not alone. Millions of others can relate to having days where you feel on top of the world, followed by periods where you feel as if everything is crashing down around you.\n\nEmerging from a low period takes time, and it\u2019s essential to enlist the help of a knowledgeable mental health professional to help you through.\n\nYour well-being is your best business asset. Knowing that you\u2019re dealing with a mental health condition is the first step towards getting the proper treatment.\n\nIf you\u2019re concerned about your emotional state, here are tips to get you started on the journey towards brighter days.\n\nKnow the signs\n\nIt can be hard to tell the difference between being overwhelmed and something more serious, especially if you\u2019re used to operating under pressure most of the time. But there is a line between a normal reaction to daily stressors and diagnosable mental illness.\n\nStress is generally temporary, and short-term. When symptoms persist for longer than two weeks, you may be dealing with a mental health condition instead. Negative feelings that are extreme, persistent, and interfere with daily functioning such as the following shouldn\u2019t be ignored:\n\nLoss of freedom.\n\nYou feel they as if you have no alternative way of acting. This can include feeling hopeless or that you cannot overcome difficulties in your life or work.\n\nLoss of relationships.\n\nThis can manifest as withdrawal from social events or isolation from family and colleagues.\n\nLoss of productive life.\n\nSleeping and eating patterns change significantly and you may find yourself not caring about activities you once loved.\n\nPersonal distress.\n\nMost commonly this manifests as pervasive and unchanging negative thoughts and feelings including rage, worry, and guilt.\n\nIf you recognize any of the above signs, seek help. Don\u2019t rationalize away your struggles or simply dismiss them as the result of being crazy busy. Take care of yourself, so that you can take care of business, and more importantly, tend to your emotional well-being in the process.\n\nGet help\n\nNo matter what you\u2019re struggling with, help is available \u2014 even on a budget or without insurance. Many clinicians offer counseling on a sliding fee scale depending on income. Community health centers, teaching hospitals, universities also may offer psychotherapy services at lower cost.\n\nYou can also take advantage of education and resources (including online and in person support groups) through national organizations like:\n\nNational Alliance of Mental Illness\n\nMental Health America\n\nDepression and Bipolar Support Alliance\n\nAnxiety and Depression Association of America\n\nSome experts estimate there are more 400 different types of therapy in practice today, so it\u2019s important to understand what different approaches entail in order to figure out what will be right for you. Medication may also be an option.\n\nBefore choosing to work with someone, request a consultation to make sure it\u2019s a good fit. If you\u2019re looking for someone who understands entrepreneurial struggles, ask about their experience guiding people around issues of work, career, or experience they have working with CEOs, founders, or freelancers.\n\nRemember, your ability to face challenges, even personal ones, can be your greatest strength. And no matter how dark it gets, please never give up.\n\nDisclaimer: this not intended to be medical advice.

In the United States, particularly among conservatives, it is regarded as a sacred founding principle.\n\nThe self-made (wo)man; pulling yourself up by your bootstraps; Bear Grylls battling alone in the wilderness; the western psyche is teeming with ideas and ideals \u2014 both unconscious and overt \u2014 that celebrate those who go it alone, reject assistance and single-handedly conquer, overcome and succeed. But as honorable as the idea of self-sufficiency is, (and as desirable as it may be when compared to complete dependency), it seems that we may be taking the idea of self-reliance to the extreme.\n\nAccording to anthropologists, one of the main reasons humans have flourished on this planet is our cooperative behaviors; our ability to help, support and share new knowledge with each other. However, in recent generations, as our ideals have changed and our infatuation with self-reliance has deepened, we have lost sight of this vital human quality.\n\nWe (especially in developed nations) have come to view vulnerability and help-seeking as a weakness. We have come to regard self-sufficiency as the single greatest factor of success.

I was too young to fully appreciate the gravity of the situation, but I was astute enough to know some things. Firstly, my father had completely abandoned all responsibility of his household, wife and children and had fled the country to avoid the obligatory childcare payments. Secondly, my mother was relatively unskilled and poorly educated (having married and fallen pregnant at the age of 16) and had no immediate family in our hometown. Lastly, as hardworking and tenacious as she was, I was aware that my mother was forced to juggle any prospective employment with the incredible demands of three school-age children.\n\nI remember my mother\u2019s distress one night as she scoured the house to find some money, any money, with which to buy us dinner. Her search revealed one, single cent. I vividly recall the day the bank placed a For Sale sign on our front lawn to advertise the mortgagee auction that would render us homeless, and my mother defiantly ordering my older brother to remove it immediately and hide it in our garden shed. I remember the potted plant we optimistically re-purposed as a Christmas tree by regaling it with ragged tinsel and mismatched baubles and I can still recall the night the \u2018repo man\u2019 came to repossess our beloved color TV.\n\nBut I remember other things too.\n\nI remember the welfare payments starting, the generous policy of the New Zealand government, and our joy at being able to fill our kitchen cupboards again. I remember the neighbors who came to help and lighten my mother\u2019s overbearing workload. I remember the pastor of the local church discussing with my mother how to renegotiate her mortgage, write a good resum\u00e9 and find peace with the actions of my father. I remember school holidays spent with grandparents, aunts and family friends while my mother worked two jobs to keep her family fed and safe. I remember the \u2018repo man\u2019 sitting with my brothers and me before taking the television, so that we could watch CHiPs in full color one, final time. I remember my mother\u2019s panic when my brother was hit by a car and I now acknowledge, as an adult, the incredible gift of public healthcare that ensured my impoverished mother did not have to pay one dollar toward his hospitalization and recuperation.\n\nNeeding help is not a weakness; it is an inevitable byproduct of a fickle human existence, and offering and receiving help is the cornerstone of a well-functioning society.\n\nBut in our reverence of self-reliance, it seems we have come to ignore the courage and resilience of those who speak up when they are vulnerable. We have learned to belittle those who have the humility to ask for help and, vitally, we have begun to overlook the incredible benefits of seeking assistance, support and cooperation:\n\nAt work : Studies show that seeking the help of a mentor increases career satisfaction, commitment and likelihood of advancement.\n\n: Studies show that seeking the help of a mentor increases career satisfaction, commitment and likelihood of advancement.

In the process, she raised her three children into successful, adventurous and independent adults. But my mother could never have done it alone. In her time of greatest vulnerability, she asked for help \u2026 and the village, that most fundamental lynch-pin of humanity, stepped in to carry her.\n\nSo, yes. Having the courage and tenacity to take charge of your circumstances is vital. Self-reliance, self-belief and self-responsibility are admirable personal traits and should be nurtured and encouraged in all of us.\n\nBut the idea that we can succeed in life without any life-lines, guidance or support is a dangerous myth.

We feel nervous when we're going to approach someone with an important question, or feel butterflies when we're about to give a presentation.\n\nThe sweaty palms and rapid heartbeat you experience are normally thought of as hindrances to your performance, but we actually developed this response on purpose to react when we were faced with danger.\n\nAccording to social worker and psychotherapist Amy Morin, this evolutionary trait has stuck with us from the early days of humanity, meaning our responses to everyday situations are sometimes disproportionate.\n\n\"Once upon a time I believe [anxiety] served us well, when we were faced with a predator, or in a life or death situation,\" Morin told Business Insider. \"The body's natural reaction the fight or flight response tells you you need to do something because you're in danger, but I think in our modern world, even when we aren't in danger, you might get that same reaction like it's a life or death situation.\"\n\nFor example, if you are about to approach your boss to ask for a raise, your body might start producing adrenaline which puts you on edge.\n\n\"When that happens for a lot of us, it's like these alarm bells go off \u2014 false alarms because we're not actually in danger \u2014 but it affects our behaviour,\" Morin said. \"Then we don't do those things that are scary because we just don't like the way that it feels.\"\n\nIf someone develops an anxiety disorder, they feel anxious all the time, and they don't necessarily know why, and this can take a toll on them, Morin says. Day to day anxiety doesn't become a disorder until it starts to affect your daily functioning, such as you can't go to work or school, or you have trouble socialising.\n\nRegular anxiety, however, can be channelled and used as a tool, Morin says. To do that, you need to start thinking of it objectively. Rather than getting into a downward spiral of feeling anxious and telling yourself you won't do well as a result, Morin recommends you tell yourself that you are anxious, but that doesn't mean you can't perform well too.\n\n\"That can take a lot of that subjectivity out of it, and stop the anxious feelings we get and the physiological response that leads to all of this catastrophic thinking and doom and gloom \u2013 I'm never going to succeed, it's never going to go well,\" Morin said. \"It's really about getting better control over your thoughts, and being more aware of how it affects your body.\"\n\nNew research has shown that being anxious doesn't always have to hurt performance. The study, published in the Journal of Individual Differences found that those who look at a stressful situation as a challenge can gain energy from their anxiety. So instead of dwelling on the fact you feel anxious, try and channel that energy in your body into something positive.\n\nMorin says one way to do this is to have a mantra to help keep the negative thoughts at bay \u2014 something that you say to yourself over and over such as \"I've studied hard for four years, I will do well on this test.\"\n\nAnother tactic is to re-frame your thoughts and consider what you would say to a friend in the same situation. Morin says we tend to be a lot kinder to our friends and family than we are to ourselves, so think of what advice you would give, and how supportive you would be.\n\nYou can also label your emotions. Recognise how you feel and tell yourself what emotions you are feeling, such as if you are anxious, scared, or worried. Acknowledging our feelings is a big part of overcoming them, Morin says.\n\nFinally, she adds that you should find some healthy stress relievers, whether that be exercise, talking to friends, or treating yourself to something to keep your everyday stress down.\n\n\"When you can manage your everyday stress, sometimes those little things aren't as life altering as you think, and it can help keep things in perspective managing your stress level,\" Morin said. \"I see a lot of people who have anxiety, then worry about having anxiety, and that creates this cycle where they're anxious about being anxious.

That day came for me this week when I tried out the viral internet sensation that is the Gravity blanket.\n\nIt feels like what you might guess a soft mass of 20 pounds evenly spread across your body to feel like: the pressure is not uncomfortable, but it\u2019s certainly there. I often kick and thrash in my sleep, but the blanket\u2019s pressure made it difficult to move, but not in a bad way. The blanket was a velvety presence saying sternly, but lovingly, be still. Though I am not a good napper, enveloped by the unbelievably heavy blanket, I actually fell asleep.\n\nThe Gravity blanket made internet waves earlier this year when it raised a remarkable $4,729,263 during its Kickstarter campaign. It\u2019s marketed as a \u201cnatural solution for a stressed-out society\u201d which includes helping you get better sleep, according to its website.\n\nThe weighted blanket comes in 15, 20 and 25 pound options. You\u2019re recommended to choose a blanket that\u2019s about 10 percent of their bodyweight. The \u201chugging\u201d sensation that I enjoyed so much can, according to its website, reportedly help people stay still and calm throughout the night.\n\nI can\u2019t speak to whether the blanket helped me sleep through the night better as I only took it for a cool 20-minute nap. (It was too heavy to lug home, and we were on an office-based trial period with the blanket. And despite the hilarity that would ensue trying to get a 20 pound blanket from Manhattan to Brooklyn on the subway, I have horrifying visions of the blanket getting pulled into a \u201cShowtime\u201d routine.)\n\nWhat I can say is that I\u2019ve never been able to nap in the middle of the day, despite trying. I\u2019ve tried napping in the backseat of my car, on the subway, behind an artfully constructed stack of binders during class in college, in doctor\u2019s waiting rooms. Most workplaces make it pretty difficult to nap\u2014I am reminded of an episode of The Office where Kelly Kapoor is gifted with a nap sanctuary by her coworkers: a blanket on the floor underneath the conference room table. But to be clear, at Thrive Global we have a nap pod, so we are blessed with the resources to nap if one desires. But until now, my forays into the nap pod have been fruitless and resulted in ample selfies of me inside the strange futuristic orb.\n\nMike Grillo, Gravity\u2019s managing director, brought the blanket to the Thrive Global offices and explained that it can be used to help a variety of conditions including stress, anxiety, insomnia and post-traumatic stress disorder. It\u2019s not hard to imagine that something incredibly soft and heavy could help people feel comfortable.\n\nStill, the science behind the blanket is rather thin, though weighted blankets have been used in occupational therapy for a while. The company changed their Kickstarter page to reflect that it can be used to help people with certain health conditions, not necessarily treat them, as STAT News reported. But the sheer number of people yearning to spend $279 on what some may consider a glorified comforter (it\u2019s not) exemplifies how desperate people are to get better sleep.\n\nSleep, and how to improve it, is very much in the zeitgeist right now. It\u2019s \u201ctrendy.\u201d There\u2019s a good reason for that: the CDC estimates that between 50 and 70 million Americans suffer from a sleep disorder or sleep-deprivation, which they label a public health problem. The National Sleep Foundation recommends that adults get between 7 to 9 hours of sleep a night. And unless you have a rare genetic mutation, functioning on less sleep than you need is basically like walking around drunk. Sleep-deprived people are also at greater risk for a host of chronic diseases, depression, obesity and cancer, not to mention increased mortality. And while upward of nine million Americans use a prescription sleep aid, the research indicates that sleeping pills actually lead to less of the deepest, most restorative forms of sleep.\n\nPlus, just in time for Halloween, the popular sleeping pill Ambien has been linked to many spooky side effects like sleepwalking and midnight trips to the kitchen. \u201cNight eaters said they woke up to find Tostitos and Snickers wrappers in their beds,\u201d the New York Times reports in an article about the side effects of sleeping pills.\u201d Ambien has also been connected to legitimately horrifying effects too, like sleep-driving.\n\nAnd among the wide, weird realm of non-prescription sleep aids, the Gravity blanket seems very mild. Jerome Groopman wrote about how many sleep-related gadgets were at the Consumer Electronics Show in 2017 for The New Yorker, everything from a breathing sensor that you strap to your chest which, naturally, comes with an app that helps you coordinate breathing with \u201ctonal music\u201d to help lower anxiety to a six-foot pod called the Magnesphere which surrounds you with \u201callegedly restorative electromagnetic fields,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to understand why a heavy blanket\u2014that wouldn\u2019t directly cause one to wind up with Snickers wrappers in their bed or involve electromagnetic fields\u2014would be alluring.\n\nSo while I can\u2019t confirm that the Gravity blanket scientifically improves your sleep, in my experience, I felt an undeniable feeling of safety after being tucked snugly under a plush 20-pound blanket. I imagine it\u2019s not dissimilar to how dogs feel when they get strapped into a ThunderShirt before an incoming storm. The blanket might just help people cultivate their sleep-hygiene routine, which can (and should) include things like leaving your phone out of the bedroom and limiting screens before bedtime.

Are Your Children?", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/skinner-production/stories/featured_images/000/014/381/large/patterned_breathing.jpg?1506993351", "text": "We enter the world with a breath and the process continues automatically for the rest of our lives. Although breathing is an involuntary function, the manner in which we breathe has an enormous effect on our health. Breathing is an innate bodily function which most of us take completely for granted \u2013 it only gets our attention when it\u2019s not up to par.\n\nYet, day to day and night to night many of us are not breathing correctly, which compromises our health, productivity, learning and sleep. Through my involvement with sleep scientists, medical and dental sleep experts, and having recently taken a 4-day Breathing Re-Education training with renowned breathing expert Patrick McKeown, I realized that the manner in which we breathe demands some attention. Actually, lots of attention. Although, breathing is a 24/7 operation, how you breathe during the day is critical to how well you breathe during sleep.\n\nWhen I ask people if they breathe through their nose or mouth, many don\u2019t know or haven\u2019t thought about it. There are both misconceptions and lack of awareness about the best way to breathe. For example, yoga training to breathe in through the nose and out through the mouth can be misleading. At Linked In, Global Wellness Director Michael Susi created a wellness framework based on 6 Tenets of Wellness, one of which is breathing. Recognizing the importance of healthy breathing supports the company\u2019s commitment to programming that fosters a comprehensive and impactful approach for employees to thrive.\n\nAs I learned from Patrick McKeown, the nose performs at least thirty functions on behalf of the body.1 Along with providing a sense of smell, the nose is nature\u2019s way of preparing air before it enters the lungs. As the nostrils are much smaller than the mouth, they slow down breathing resulting in a 10-20% greater oxygen uptake in the blood.2 Breathing optimally through the nose not only increases blood oxygenation, but also increases the amount of oxygen delivered to tissues and organs.3\n\nThe way we breathe and breathing volume have a direct impact on our sleep quality, as well as on how we function during our waking hours. Healthy breathing should be through the nose, driven by the diaphragm, calm, and almost undetectable. Unhealthy breathing, involves breathing through the mouth or having noticeable breathing during rest. These seemingly innocuous habits literally disrupt biochemistry and deprive the body of oxygen. Nasal breathing results in a higher concentration of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) in the blood thereby providing optimal distribution of oxygen to your muscles and organs including the heart and brain. While often thought to be a waste gas, CO 2 is the key variable to allow the release of O 2 from the red blood cells to be metabolized in the body. A key determining factor of how much oxygen your body can use is actually the amount of CO 2 in your blood.\n\nMany people over-breathe, meaning they take in more air than required which in turn causes too much carbon dioxide to be exhaled, leaving the body gasping for O 2 . It\u2019s a vicious cycle. Over breathing can also cause our airways to narrow, further limiting the body\u2019s ability to oxygenate properly. Most people are unaware of this as the signs are not always obvious. According to Patrick McKewon in his book, The Oxygen Advantage, even pro athletes can be over breathers. For them, the body may be very strong, but due to improper breathing, the lungs and breathing muscles give out long before the arms and legs.\n\nMouth breathing is another common breathing problem whereby the person bypasses critical functions of breathing through the nose. Be it from habit or because of clogged nasal airways due to allergies or a deviated septum, the impact is negative for your health and well-being. Improper daytime breathing can result in breathing actually stopping during sleep, a condition known as obstructive sleep apnea. When this happens, there are many associated health risks. Furthermore, the \u201chunger\u201d hormones leptin and grehlin are influenced which leads to unwanted weight gain.\n\nSo you may ask, how did this happen? What is causing us to breathe incorrectly if our anatomy was structured to do it differently? Environmental culprits such as allergies, structural issues, our diets, and/or poor habits acquired during childhood or adulthood can all lead to mouth vs. nasal breathing. The bigger question is HOW TO CORRECT YOUR BREATHING? Here are some tips:\n\n\u25cf Be aware. Ask yourself if you are breathing properly. Observe your breathing and that of your family. Do they breathe using the upper chest or through an open mouth? Peek in on your kids at night and observe their breathing during the day.\n\n\u25cf Recognize signs that suggest breathing needs to be corrected such as fatigue, snoring, asthma, regular sighs or sniffing or yawning, heavy breathing at rest or during physical exercise.\n\n\u25cf Engage in breathing lessons with a skilled practitioner such as your physician, an ENT, a Buteyko breathing specialist, orofacial myofunctional therapist or physical therapist.\n\n\u25cf Asthma sufferers, who are generally more tired than their non-asthma counterparts, should take heed and explore breathing training in conjunction with medical treatment as a pathway to potential minimization of symptoms and improved health.\n\n\u00b7 Take necessary action to correct your breathing NOW! Try Spire, a great device to become familiar with your breathing patterns and how they relate to stress, anxiety, activity, calm, and more.\n\n\u00b7 HELP! Seek examination from a medical professional to evaluate any nasal or airway obstruction that can be causing improper breathing including mouth breathing, as well as to receive diagnosis and treatment for a potential sleep disorder. If you are being treated for Obstructive Sleep Apnea with a CPAP or Oral Appliance, be conscious of how you are breathing during the day as well.\n\n\u25cf Experience what it FEELS like to breathe well through the nose. Try MUTE by Rhinomed, a nasal dilator which is both comfortable and effective to increase nasal air-flow. I have witnessed many people, including myself have an AH HA moment when they put in the device and experience increased nasal airflow immediately. MUTE is designed for sleep to increase nasal airflow and minimize snoring. The TURBINE, also by Rhinomed, is for athletes to wear during exercise. In fact, Chris Froome, four time Tour de France winner, has worn it during his wins. Just that moment when you realize how much better you can breathe, well there\u2019s no turning back!\n\nProper breathing both during the day and night is central to our health. We are designed to inhale and exhale through our nose, from our very first breath to our very last. Become familiar with how you breathe. If mouth breathing is evident, it is important to take steps to evaluate why. Make some notes of your observations and share them with your family physician to identify the cause. Expert help is available to get your breathing on track for your health, well-being and optimal functioning\u202624/7.\n\nTimmons B.H., Ley R.

In perhaps it\u2019s most simple definition, stress is simply a stimulus for change. Positive experiences such as a family vacation, getting married or even winning the lottery all come with their share of stress and stimulation. And while it\u2019s easy to blame our stress on what\u2019s going on around us, a significant part of our relationship with stress is based on the hidden internal stress we deal with each day \u2014 eating too much of the wrong foods or too few of the right ones, living a sedentary lifestyle or overtraining at the gym, being a perfectionist or lacking motivation to get up in the morning.\n\nSo how do you know if you have an unhealthy dependence on stress? The following few questions may help you figure it out:\n\nDo you thrive on tight deadlines?\n\nDo you often leave things until the last minute?\n\nDo you have a difficult time doing nothing at all?\n\nDoes it take you a few days off to feel like you\u2019re on vacation?\n\nDo you spend much of your vacation time thinking about work?\n\nDo you constantly worry about what you might be missing?\n\nDo you feel stressed when you\u2019re disconnected to your cell phone or computer?\n\nDo you find it difficult to turn your brain off at night to sleep?\n\nDo you feel as though there is never enough time to get things done?\n\nDo you ever feel as though your work for the day is not enough?\n\nDo you lack time to see your friends or participate in hobbies you used to enjoy?\n\nDo you feel as though you\u2019re constantly running from one thing to the next?\n\nDo you find yourself finishing, or wanting to finish, other peoples\u2019 statements?\n\nDo you wish I\u2019d stop asking questions so you can get on with the blog already?\n\nIf you found yourself saying Yes more than once or twice, you might be a stress addict. Another way to tell \u2014 close your eyes for a few moments and try to relax. How comfortable are you with doing nothing at all?\n\nStress (and drugs) have been shown to have the following side effects: increased heart rate and blood pressure, increase in blood sugar, breakdown of muscle tissue, decreased digestive functioning, ulcers, blood clotting, migraines, skin problems, premature aging, loss of brain cells, social isolation and loneliness, anxiety, panic attacks, depression, substance abuse, relationship problems, lack of focus, multitasking and disengagement. Several studies suggest that unmanaged reactions to stress are a more dangerous risk factor for cancer and heart disease than either cigarette smoking or high-cholesterol foods. And stress may even be as addictive as drugs.\n\nIn addition to the hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline, stress also releases dopamine, a \u201cfeel good\u201d chemical. Dopamine encourages repeat behaviors by activating the reward center in our brain and may be at the heart of many addictive behaviors and substance abuse issues.\n\nThinking back, are you able to notice any times where you felt you thrived on stress? Have you ever tried to take time off only to find it takes days just to get yourself to decompress? One of the challenges in stress management is fighting our tendency to be pulled back into the rush.

They should ask\n\nWhat it's like to live with an autoimmune disorder. When you have a chronic condition you do it anyway. You get up anyway. You go to work anyway. You smile to your friends anyway. And sometimes you can't get up and you can't go to work and smiling feels impossible and you can't make people understand. It's never because you're weak and it's not ever because you're giving up. That day is just a bad day; a day you couldn't make yourself feel better.\n\nTomorrow. Tomorrow you will find a way to feel better. You will try everything.\n\nUnfortunately, I can't tell you what will\n\nwork for you, just what sometimes works for me.\n\nStep 1: Treat yourself like someone you love.\n\nI cannot miss out on sleep. After a few days of missed hours, I am huddled in a fit of fatigue, light headed, dizzy and anxious.\n\nFor extra fun, I often suffer from insomnia, which can be a symptom of my Hashimotos Thyroiditis. I keep lavender oil in my night stand, a cabinet stocked with chamomile and lavender teas and stretch gently before bed.\n\nIf I absolutely cannot fall asleep, rather than lay in my anxiety, I get up and work. I assume that I will be less productive the next day, and try to make up for it ahead of time.\n\nMost important, just as you forgive the people you love, forgive yourself when you don't get enough sleep or don't eat the perfect diet. It's about you feeling well, not you being perfect\n\nStep 2: Think like a plant. You need water, light and nutrients from the earth to survive. Are you living in a way that would kill a plant? How can you possibly feel well without the very basic necessities of life?\n\nI'm often guilty of not drinking enough water, so part of my morning routine is making a gallon of lemon water. I am more likely to drink it because there is flavor. Bonus: lemon water is one of the universe's greatest gifts of health.\n\nStep 3: The elimination diet. There are many approaches, but they all have similar ideas and applications. Cut out all common allergens such as gluten, dairy, legumes, sugars, additives, and caffeine. Add one in at a time and note how your body reacts. If you feel worse after eating a certain food, I would recommend avoiding it.\n\nGoing without your favorite foods may feel miserable at first but trust me, after a few days and weeks and months, you will rarely miss doughnuts. Although, I won't lie; doughnuts are delicious.\n\nI'm never going to not have Hashimoto's Thyroiditis. I'm also never going to be taller than 5 feet on my tip-toes, but I'm a great climber and I've never not found a way to reach a cup on the top shelf.\n\nWhatever might be your condition, please don't be ashamed or afraid of it. Maybe think of it as an opportunity to treat your body really well, better than your friends who can eat pizza without consequences. See this as an opportunity to get beauty rest and understand your body in a way most people never will. Look, no one is saying this isn't difficult and frustrating. Know this: your life is yours and while it is a long and ongoing journey to health, trust yourself and your body and follow the health advice that works for you.

Maybe you really want to quit smoking, or drinking, or overeating and you have a long list of reasons why changing feels like an important thing to do (\u201cI\u2019ll be healthier\u201d, \u201cmy wife won\u2019t be angry at me when I come home\u201d, \u201cI\u2019ll be more productive in the mornings\u201d). And then, in spite of your best intentions, you find yourself turning back to the old behavior.\n\nThere are many complex reasons why changing a long-standing behavior pattern can be hard to do. And if you are trying to change a behavioral pattern that involves drugs or alcohol, it becomes even more complicated as psychoactive substances (like nicotine, caffeine, alcohol, opiates), as well as many behaviors (sex, gambling, shopping, texting) all directly impact the reward centers of the brain. Engaging in these behaviors typically \u201cfeels good\u201d in some way, so they are even harder to give up!\n\nIf you find yourself wanting to change but constantly returning to an old pattern that includes using substances, it might be a good idea to evaluate your overall level of \u201cstress.\u201d Stress, which can result in both physical and emotional symptoms, can make the already difficult process of change even harder. When we are in a state of high stress, we tend to look for things that will make us feel \u201cbetter.\u201d The effect of substances (like alcohol, pot, nicotine, opiates) is that they feel good in some way (e.g., they reduce tension, anxiety, or they pick up mood). So, when stress is high, giving up something that feels good is going to be harder than it may usually be. If your stress is chronic, then the thought of making any changes to your behaviors can seem monumental in the moment. That extra perceived effort can also derail your behavior change goals.\n\nSo\u2026how can you reduce the impact stress has on your ability to make changes? Start by learning to identify the signs that your are stressed and then try to listen to your body and enact some of the coping skills mentioned below.\n\nPhysical Signs of Stress:\n\nStress can make your body hurt and make you feel sluggish and tired. In fact, sleep disruptions are one of the hallmark symptoms of being overly stressed. Some of the most common physical signs of stress include stiff neck and back pain, headaches, and decreased libido. If you notice any of these symptoms, it is possible that you\u2019re dealing with stress! The following are important coping strategies to address the physical symptoms of stress.\n\nPractice good sleep hygiene. Yes, there IS such a thing as sleep hygiene, which includes techniques having a consistent sleep and wake up time (if you don\u2019t, you wind up functioning in a state of \u201cjet lag\u201d), avoiding caffeinated and alcoholic drinks close to bedtime, practicing getting into a relaxed state when you go to bed, and shutting off electronic devices. Give yourself regular breaks. Take a walk, stop working and eat a good dinner (not from the vending machine!) or talk with a friend. Give your mind a moment to rest and reorganize. Contrary to many people\u2019s first instincts when they are stressed, taking breaks actually makes you more efficient, more energetic, and better able to tackle the challenges in front of you. Regularly practice self-soothing techniques. Think about the 5 senses, and this will give you clues as to how you can give yourself comfort. What works for you? Listening to music, taking a bath, watching a movie, getting a massage, relaxation, yoga are all on the long list of possible ways to self-soothe. Make efforts to include these strategies in your daily routine as they will help you cope with stress and prevent becoming more stressed. Exercise regularly. Ironically, exercise is one of the first things to fall by the wayside yet is one of the most important coping techniques in terms of reducing tension and increasing energy! No matter how stressed and frantic you are feeling, remember that a brisk 20 minute walk will likely help. Maintain a healthy diet. When your mind is full of worries and pressures, many people find that they slip into \u201cmindless eating\u201d (eating whatever is immediately available\u2026\u201dthe vending machine phenomena\u201d or cravings carbs and sweets for a quick, but unsustainable, burst of energy). Maintaining a balanced diet of foods that provide a more constant source of energy (instead of that sugar spike) can be a great first line of defense against the adverse effects of stress. Even more importantly it will help you maintain a connection to your long term goals. Limit your consumption of alcohol and other mood altering substances (including sleeping aids). While a couple of glasses of wine at night can take the tension out of your shoulders for the moment, it can cause sleep disruptions and an increase in depressed mood, which, in turn, keeps your stress levels high, and increases your tension for the next day.\n\nBehavioral Signs of Stress:\n\nSometimes when you\u2019re stressed, the first noticeable signs are how you are acting (your behaviors). These can include increased clutter in your personal or work space, forgetting what you\u2019re doing or having trouble organizing yourself, and moving around very quickly or very slowly. The following suggestions are coping skills that can mitigate the signs of stress that show up in your behavior.\n\nRoutine, routine, routine\u2026 the best way to manage the disorganization and impulsiveness that come along with high levels of stress is to stick to a routine. It can be helpful to take 10 minutes every morning and plan out your day, setting aside time for the things that are causing your stress (work, household responsibilities) and the things that will help you manage it (exercise, contact with friends, pleasurable activities). Write things down. If ideas are running around in your head as you try to go to sleep at night, set aside 10 minutes about an hour before you go to bed to write down all the things you are worried that you haven\u2019t done or will forget to do. Don\u2019t go beyond 10 minutes as this technique is not about ruminating and obsessing! It is about teaching your brain that you have all your worries recorded and that you will get to them the next day. Think of it like packing all your worries in a suitcase, and then putting it away, not to be opened until tomorrow. Then spend the hour before you go to bed engaged in some routine, soothing activities like reading a book or taking a bath.\n\nMental and emotional signs of stress:\n\nFinally, stress can show up in your emotions or in your internal world. This can look like feeling very emotional and having your emotions change wildly with little notice, or feeling disconnected from everything around you. There are several techniques that can help you manage the negative effects stress has on your thoughts and feelings, here\u2019s one:\n\nBe mindful of your attitude and approach to your life. The way we see ourselves in the world can have a big impact on how we experience stress. For example, feeling like you need to be perfect can make you a thorough and precise person who is counted on by others to do a good job. Great!..BUT\u2026 that way of thinking can also cause an enormous amount of internal stress since no one is perfect and no one can function at 100% in all areas of their life. Changing your thoughts from \u201cI have to work on this project until I get it done perfectly\u201d\u2026to \u201cI\u2019ll do the best that I can in the time that I have\u201d can take your stress levels down to something much more manageable. Similarly, many people feel that they should be able to manage everything without asking for help. While this attitude in life can make you a very independent person, it can also cause you to be more burdened and less efficient that you need be\u2026realizing that everyone needs help sometimes can act to reduce stress.\n\nUnderstanding and recognizing when you\u2019re stressed and how you\u2019re expressing your stress are important in helping you find which skills you need to help cope with your stress. Remember, stress is an important and inevitable part of life, it will show up for you at some point. Practicing these skills can help you cope with your stress so you can continue with your life and stay true to your larger goals and values.", "url": "https://journal.thriveglobal.com/behavioral-strategies-for-coping-with-stress-d954240ed228", "summary": "Behavioral Strategies for Coping with Stress If you notice that you\u2019re struggling to keep your behavior changes going, see how much stress is in your life and use these skills to help you cope.\nSome of the most common physical signs of stress include stiff neck and back pain, headaches, and decreased libido.\nBehavioral Signs of Stress:Sometimes when you\u2019re stressed, the first noticeable signs are how you are acting (your behaviors).\nThe following suggestions are coping skills that can mitigate the signs of stress that show up in your behavior.\nUnderstanding and recognizing when you\u2019re stressed and how you\u2019re expressing your stress are important in helping you find which skills you need to help cope with your stress.", "timescraped": 1513925442.5876539, "category": {"words": 1436, "personal": 10, "thirdperson": 10, "condition": 1, "recovery": 1}}, "c17ce516040c923cde882eef678f038f": {"title": "How to be an Advocate for Women\u2019s Mental Health \u2013 Thrive Global", "image": "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*KnuS0XZRbSTxtTja2jvEmg.jpeg", "text": "The first year of the student-led Women\u2019s Mental Health Talks (WMHT) had an overwhelming amount of success at York University. The success indicates the need for open-spaces for women to share their thoughts, struggles and feelings. Shalyn Isaacs (third year Psychology student), the founder of WMHT had her own struggles with self-esteem, anxiety and depression. After overcoming her personal demons, Isaacs started a group for women to find their voice as well.\n\nHA: What is your experience with mental health ?\n\nSI: My mental health and overall well-being was negatively impacted in my teenage years due to bullying. I was a very sensitive child with a passive and quiet personality. I would slip into the background but silently ached for validation and acceptance. I found it difficult to stand up for myself. The bullying began in elementary school and continued in high school (where it got really bad). I was also involved in unhealthy relationships that were both romantic and platonic in nature. The dynamics within these relationships were painful. I went through years of feeling depressed, experiencing low self-esteem and social anxiety. By my first year of university, I avoided social exchanges, outings, or friendships of any kind. The first year of university is where you\u2019re supposed to step outside of your comfort zone, go to parties, have fun and meet new people \u2014 but having depression, low self-confidence, and anxiety made it very difficult for me to form relationships with those around me.\n\nHA: Was there a turning point in your mental health journey ?\n\nSI: Yes, there was. During my second year in university, I was in a very unhealthy relationship with someone who undermined my worth. I accepted this treatment because that was all I knew. My depression and anxiety were at an all-time high and my grades in school were declining due to my inability to concentrate. I realized that something needed to change. After that relationship ended, I spent some time giving myself the time and attention that I deserved. I began seeing a counsellor. I spent time doing things alone that made me happy and reminded myself that I was a beautiful person worthy of so much goodness in life. I also re-told myself the story of my life which altered my perspective. Rather than seeing the bullies of my past as having so much power over me, and seeing myself as a victim, I now viewed those painful situations and people as circumstances that forced me to grow. This shift in perspective empowered me. Slowly, I began to believe in myself without seeking validation from anyone. By the end of second year (in university), it was a little bit easier to reach out to people and form relationships. I learned how to trust others, and believe that not everyone was out there to hurt or reject me. As the confidence in myself grew, every day I made a conscious effort to step outside of my comfort zone. I began to share my thoughts and opinions openly and unapologetically. I also made an effort to meet people and make friends through volunteering. I now have a couple of good quality relationships around me. The love and support from those relationships has been invaluable to improving my mental health. My mental health is still a journey, and it will probably always be to some extent. For now, I feel like there are nothing but good things ahead of me. Even when difficult situations arise, I am confident that I am more than capable of handling it.\n\nDiscussions Director Krystin West (left) with a volunteer at an out-reach event. Courtesy, Shalyn Isaacs\n\nHA : What is Women\u2019s Mental Health Talks and what\u2019s your involvement there?\n\nSI : I am the founder and president of Women\u2019s Mental Health Talks . WMHT is a student-led support group at York University that hosts open-discussion meetings around topics centred around women\u2019s mental health. It is an organization that I started last year with a wonderful team of executive members who have done a phenomenal job of reaching women at York University. We work to create strategies women can use to improve their well-being and relationships. Some examples of discussion meetings we hosted this year included: \u2018Strategies for managing Anxiety and Depression\u2019, \u2018How to establish Healthy Relationships\u2019, \u2018Building Self-Confidence\u2019, \u2018Expression and Communication\u2019, and \u2018How to have a Positive Body Image\u2019. These support groups serve as opportunities for women to share their experiences in a safe and accepting environment with other women who have faced similar circumstances. In this way, women heal and empower themselves while empowering women around them as well. During our first year, we experienced an overwhelming amount of success. We also collaborated with other clubs at York (such as The Women\u2019s Empowerment Club). It has been a blessing and privilege to witness the growth, support and healing of so many women who attend these discussion meetings.\n\nHA: What are some ways that you protect your mental health?\n\nSI: I write a lot in my journal. My journal is filled with thoughts, realizations, poetry and musings. Writing has always been an art that heals and strengthens me. I also have a strong connection with God and I make time during numerous points throughout my day to ask God for guidance. That has never failed to provide me with an unshakeable strength and belief in myself during times when I was afraid. Prayer and meditation every day helps as well. I still experience anxiety and the occasional anxiety attack, so I use \u2018grounding\u2019 techniques to calm me. (Grounding techniques include :) I acknowledge the physical objects and environment around me by using my senses to describe them. An example of this is, \u201cThis table is hard and smooth. This coffee smells nice. There is a washroom beside me. This chair is stable and supporting me.\u201d Statements like these bring me back to the present moment and help me to realize that I will be okay. Additionally, maintaining healthy relationships with quality people who love and appreciate me is crucial to maintaining my mental health. Lastly, I do self-affirmations and mirror work. This involves saying phrases to myself while looking in the mirror such as, \u201cI am kind. I am strong. I am smart. I am beautiful. I am loved. I am successful.\u201d As you repeat these messages to yourself repeatedly, you program your subconscious mind to believe it and your life changes in positive ways as a result.\n\nFor more information on WMHT check out their Facebook Page, Twitter and Instagram.\n\n*Previous editions of this article has Shalyn Isaacs last name spelled as \u201cIssacs\u201d.

It can be a hard thing to describe if you haven\u2019t experienced it , but one way to think about it is that depression places a lens between you and the world around you.\n\nThis \u2018lens\u2019 changes the way you perceive the world and, to a greater or lesser extent, it changes everything. But you don\u2019t know this is happening.\n\nYou can only see through the lens, you have no way to look around it\u2019s edge. Because of this, you cannot compare what you see through the lens with the world looks like without that lens.\n\nNo Positive to Accentuate\n\nYou may have people telling you \u201cyou\u2019re looking at things wrong\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019re focusing too much on the negative\u201d. They want you to focus more on the positive aspects of life but, because of the lens, you cannot see these positives.\n\nTheir message, as well meaning as it may be, is incoherent to you. Because of the lens, you are unable to see what they see. As an analogy, they could be telling you that the sky is blue but, when you look up and see the sky through the lens of depression, it is red.\n\nYou have no way to reconcile their viewpoint with your own. You can\u2019t try to see it from their perspective, because that\u2019s impossible to do through the lens. You can\u2019t understand what they\u2019re saying because every piece of information you have is telling you the contrary.\n\nYour Mind is Lying To You\n\nBecause of this lens, everything you experience is tainted by the disease. Your entire experience of reality is distorted.\n\nWhen people describe depression as \u2018your mind is lying to you\u2019, this is what they mean. Your mind is interpreting things as it understands them but, because of the disease, this understanding is fundamentally flawed.\n\nThis distortion is variable; sometimes things seem clear, sometimes it significantly worse, but it\u2019s always there. There\u2019s no way to see around the lens, so there\u2019s no way to see the truth beyond.\n\nNo Sunshine\n\nOne common symptom of depression is finding a lack of pleasure in things you used to enjoy. Again, this can be a difficult thing to recognize in yourself. From your perspective the thing itself has changed, so the fact you no longer find it fun seems perfectly rational.\n\nIt can be hard to explain this. When someone asks you, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you want to do [X]?\u201d you can\u2019t give a clear answer. There\u2019s nothing intrinsic in the activity that\u2019s changed, but it\u2019s developed a pallor that\u2019s unappealing. And it\u2019s a pallor only you can see.\n\nThis is another symptom of the disease, a distortion by the lens. The pleasure you once found in an activity is filtered out and it\u2019s become, at best, just another chore.\n\nShatter the Walls\n\nDepression can also feel endless. The idea that things will change can seem hopeless. Since, when viewed through the lens, reality is fundamentally tinted, it can seem futile to think this will change. Because we think of reality as fixed and not something that can be changed. But it\u2019s our perception of the world that will change. As the disease is treated, the symptoms will ease and that lens will clear.\n\nIt can be hard to \u2018see\u2019 that you have depression, since the disease itself distorts your view of the world. It\u2019s a prison where every wall is made of tinted glass. Things can seem hopeless, they can seem that there\u2019s no opportunity for improvement, but this is wrong.\n\nWith professional help those walls can be smashed. It takes time, you\u2019ll need help. But they can be shattered.\n\nAbout\n\nStuart Fitzwilliam is a runner and writer living in Southern California.

I've been on every form of medication that over time, stopped working for me. At the age of twenty-five, I decided to take matters into my own hands. However, my condition is chronic. The term, 'chronic' used to scare me--it's meaning so absolute. While on my journey toward healing, I gained some insights in my quest to live as close to anxiety-free as possible.\n\nEvery day, we're managing a lot, more so than we may realize: our health, our work, our families all while trying to balance everything out. And just because you have (chronic) anxiety, doesn't mean you'll have to continuously suffer until it launches you to the 'flight' part of the fight or flight response. That used to be me on repeat. If I felt overwhelmed, I'd flee and probably do something destructive like staying in bed all day with a bag or box of junk food and be paralyzed, watching as my plate of obligations filled up. I'd have these extended periods of freezing that might last days or weeks (years ago, not anymore).\n\nA large percentage of people don't understand that anxiety is far beyond simply a rapid heartbeat, sweating, spinning or blurred vision. It has debilitated me far worse than the basics. Nervousness is a sliver of anxiety. Even everyday stressors (multiple studies reported) can quickly induce symptoms that feel like a full-blown panic attack.\n\nOne behavior I'd slip into was internalizing everything that happened to me--talking about things until obsessing, mercilessly thinking about my misfortunes or past mistakes, and second-guessing my every move from the food I'd eat to the projects I've done. Internalizing stress caused many of my down-spirals.\n\nEven the demands of everyday life stuff--simple things such as grocery shopping, running errands, appointments, cleaning, or cooking feel like laborious tasks. You run out of spoons by dinner time and think, 'just stick a fork in me; I'm done. Everyone can starve tonight,' and hear the angry sigh in the peanut gallery.\n\nIf I'm operating on overdrive, physically, I'm not accomplishing things and begin to feel this indescribable pressure. Then, this happens: I'll put the cart before the horse; classic anxiety invoking behavior. I'll be working on a project and then do something that applies pressure or a time constraint. Rushing ahead and getting through something because it's uncomfortable or not what I'd expected strained me in every way. My anxiety would slam on the gas pedal.\n\nI'd want to catapult forward just to reach a destination, to get over the hardship, and when I realized how this behavior affected me, I changed it immediately. My work isn't the only area of my life where I've allowed this behavior; I've done this in my personal life too. I was never a patient person, but racing ahead creates a magnitude of setbacks and trouble. I've witnessed how my choices and actions interfered with my ability to function.\n\nNow, though, if a project isn't complete, I don't talk about or publicize it as if it is complete. Life doesn't need to be like a marathon. I'd ask myself frequently: what's the hurry? It's important to enjoy the process of things, even when it's not exciting. I like to be quiet and accomplish a task until it's my best. I schedule set blocks of time that I stick to daily to reach goals in my professional life so I can also relax, have family time, and do other stuff like exercise.\n\nOnce I've identified these cart before the horse ways of functioning, I found it easier to change them. I've had to change a lot of behaviors and habits to attain the life I so desired, which took years of counseling and being open with people about it. Remember, this is coming from someone (me) who has dealt with chronic anxiety for more than twenty years. I'm not afraid to admit that I have anxiety or to share with others. It should be talked about more. This condition hasn't stopped me from doing anything. Don't allow it to keep stopping you.\n\nToday, I don't get overwhelmed to the point of paralysis because I've established routines to keep my work and personal life separate and in proper alignment.

(Remember when you needed a college email address to get a Facebook account?) But despite the popularity of social platforms, and the sheer amount of time we spend on them, the impact they have on our mental health remains a bit murky. Now a new review of 65 studies about Facebook and mental health suggests that the platform is linked to negative effects on areas of mental well-being including Facebook addiction, depression, anxiety, body image and disordered eating and even alcohol use.\n\nFacebook has \u201c1.13 billion people actively using the service daily,\u201d researchers Rachel L. Frost, and Debra J. Rickwood, PhD, from the University of Canberra, Australia write in their review, published in the journal Computers in Human Behavior. \u201cOn the one hand, it provides a platform for social connection and belongingness, a core need for human beings,\u201d they write in the review. But, \u201cFacebook represents another technological medium that encourages continuous engagement: from creating and maintaining a profile of one\u2019s identity and life to responding to notifications and updates,\u201d they continued, which can be damaging to mental health.\n\nWhile the findings are complicated and show that more research needs to be done, the authors told me via email that they were surprised about \u201cthe extent of mental health problems associated with Facebook use,\u201d writing that it \u201cdemonstrates the far-reaching effects that social networking sites can potentially have on our health.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s an overview of their findings.\n\nFacebook addiction\n\nThe big picture: Addictive use of Facebook \u201cpredicted poorer well-being and mental health outcomes independent of general Facebook use,\u201d according to the review.\n\nThe details: The researchers looked at five existing articles related to addictive Facebook use, which they describe as \u201ccompulsive or habitual\u201d use that can cause \u201cnegative personal outcomes.\u201d All of the studies compared addictive use to general use, defined by amount of time spent on the platform, frequency of logins and number of Facebook friends. But it\u2019s a complicated relationship, as general use was shown to be a \u201cprecursor to addictive use,\u201d according to the review. Meaning addictive use was linked to worse mental health outcomes, but using Facebook at all could eventually lead to addictive behavior.\n\nAnxiety\n\nThe big picture: Facebook use could trigger or exacerbate anxiety for some people, including those who are already suffer from anxiety issues. But for people who find social connection via Facebook, it could reduce anxiety. Using Facebook for social connection can lead to positive mental health outcomes, but using it without feeling any social connection while you\u2019re doing it can be bad for your mental well-being.\n\nThe details: According to seven existing studies, people who experienced greater social connection from using Facebook reported less anxiety, but using Facebook exacerbated anxiety for people (in this case, students) who spent the most time on the site. One study found that people might feel less anxious while using Facebook because they didn\u2019t have to interact with people face-to-face. \u201cFace-to-face interactions may arouse more anxiety and Facebook is subsequently utilized to compensate for this fear,\u201d the researchers write in the review, meaning the social networking site could be a coping strategy for people with preexisting anxiety, the researchers note. But to make things more complicated, a different study found \u201csocial use of Facebook related to increased social anxiety.\u201d\n\nDepression\n\nThe big picture: The researchers looked at eighteen studies related to Facebook use and depression and, similar to anxiety, the link between Facebook and depression really depends on who you are and how you use it.\n\nThe details: If people found social support on Facebook, they reported lower depressive symptoms. More depressive symptoms were associated with specific metrics like time spent on the site or negative status updates. That also applied to users who tended toward neuroticism, ruminative behavior and social comparison.\n\nBody image\n\nThe big picture: Facebook users reported significantly lower body satisfaction\u2014regardless of gender\u2014compared to non-users. Time spent on Facebook was also associated with disordered eating attitudes, the review said, greater \u201cobjectified body consciousness, and, in turn, increased body shame.\u201d\n\nThe details: The researchers analyzed a total of 14 studies that looked at the potential link between body image, disordered eating and Facebook use. Facebook users were more likely to judge themselves (which the review refers to as \u201cself-objectivity\u201d) and compare their physical appearance to others than non-users. Increased Facebook was also linked to \u201cincreased disordered eating attitudes,\u201d according to the review. One study found a greater number of Facebook friends \u201cand using Facebook for social engagement related to an increased drive for thinness.\u201d Interestingly, men were significantly \u201cmore likely to report that pictures others post on Facebook\u201d made them feel badly about their own body image. Another interesting finding was that \u201cwriting personally revealing statuses and receiving extremely negative comments (compared to less negative comments) predicted greater shape concerns, eating concerns, and weight concerns over time.\u201d\n\nThe review also examined possible links between Facebook use and alcohol consumption habits and found that out of fifteen studies on the topic, a few suggested that using social networking sites during \u201cearly adulthood can influence attitudes towards alcohol use,\u201d and that people with bigger online networks were more likely to to exhibit \u201cproblematic alcohol-related behaviors,\u201d according to the review.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAgain, it\u2019s important to remember this review didn\u2019t prove causation, meaning the findings don\u2019t conclude that Facebook leads directly to any of these mental health outcomes. But they do reveal how complicated our relationship with social media is.\n\nRather than asking whether Facebook is inherently good or bad for us, the researchers think we should be asking more nuanced questions. \u201cA more meaningful direction for future research would be to investigate demographic characteristics and processes through which these effects transpire,\u201d they said over email. \u201cFor example, does passive use of Facebook (e.g., browsing Facebook friend\u2019s profiles) explain why some individuals feel depressed after using Facebook compared to those who engage in active use (e.g., posting a message on their timeline)?\u201d\n\nThis could help clarify why Facebook can be both good or bad for your mental health, depending on how you use it and who you are. For instance, some people \u201creap benefits from using Facebook, such as perceived emotional and social support,\u201d Frost and Rickwood told me, which they say makes sense considering Facebook was originally designed to help college students connect with one another. But pointing to their own review, they told me, \u201cit doesn\u2019t appear to be the sheer use of Facebook, but rather how an individual interacts with and interprets content on Facebook that affects mental health,\u201d they write.\n\nAnother interesting finding was that having more friends on Facebook didn\u2019t necessarily equal stronger social connections. In fact, \u201cmany studies that reported a negative correlation between number of Facebook friends and mental health outcomes, such that more Facebook friends were more commonly associated with poorer mental health,\u201d the researchers said via email.\n\nThey\u2019re not exactly sure why this was true but they offered two possibilities. \u201cFirst, those users with more online friends are likely going to be exposed to a larger number of peer profiles. Such exposure may be problematic for individuals who have a tendency to compare themselves to their peers or ruminate. Alternatively, previous researchers have suggested that lonely individuals are more likely to add Facebook friends to feel connected to others; however, if their social support needs are still not met, they may be vulnerable to mental health problems.\u201d\n\nTheir suggestion? People should limit Facebook use if they feel it\u2019s \u201chaving a negative impact on their daily functioning or is becoming difficult to regulate.\u201d If you don\u2019t know where to start, the researchers recommend \u201cturning off Facebook notification prompts, refraining from use prior to sleep, and developing healthy patterns of use, such as logging out of Facebook during a set period of study or work.\u201d\n\nThey also told me that \u201cit might be worthwhile for all people to have a periodic respite from Facebook to see how it affects them. Understanding your personal balance, including the amount and types of features and functionalities you use, will help to facilitate the benefits of social networking site use while minimizing possible harms.\u201d\n\nFor more information on how social media keeps us hooked\u2014and tips on how to set healthy boundaries with technology\u2014visit our Time Well Spent section.", "url": "https://www.thriveglobal.com/stories/13382-what-65-studies-can-tell-us-about-facebook-and-mental-health", "summary": "Now a new review of 65 studies about Facebook and mental health suggests that the platform is linked to negative effects on areas of mental well-being including Facebook addiction, depression, anxiety, body image and disordered eating and even alcohol use.\nFacebook addictionThe big picture: Addictive use of Facebook \u201cpredicted poorer well-being and mental health outcomes independent of general Facebook use,\u201d according to the review.\nMeaning addictive use was linked to worse mental health outcomes, but using Facebook at all could eventually lead to addictive behavior.\nUsing Facebook for social connection can lead to positive mental health outcomes, but using it without feeling any social connection while you\u2019re doing it can be bad for your mental well-being.\nIn fact, \u201cmany studies that reported a negative correlation between number of Facebook friends and mental health outcomes, such that more Facebook friends were more commonly associated with poorer mental health,\u201d the researchers said via email.", "timescraped": 1513925419.5740328, "category": {"words": 1366, "personal": 9, "thirdperson": 25, "condition": 23, "recovery": 1}}, "eb8f4838d430491909434b3772539e4f": {"title": "Anxiety", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/skinner-production/stories/featured_images/000/015/743/large/97790610-701f-4a05-933b-c2c505e29d31.jpeg?1508947492", "text": "I\u2019m an introvert.

I avoid large, loud, party-like situations like the plague. If I\u2019m ever forced to attend one, I\u2019m the girl you\u2019ll find sitting in the corner alone, taking it all in, observing it all with a nervous smile pasted on my face. It probably sounds like I don\u2019t like people, but you might be shocked to discover that it\u2019s really quite the opposite. You see, I love people. I love connecting with people. I love learning and understanding what makes folks tick. I love diving into deep, meaningful conversations with old friends or perfect strangers.\n\nSo why do social situations make my stomach turn? I dislike small talk. It makes me nervous. I never have any idea what to say. Crowds are intense for me. I can actually sense the feelings of those around me, and I\u2019m drawn to understand the reason behind those feelings. I\u2019m so distracted by the emotions of others that I can\u2019t really focus on anything else. Social situations drain me, and it takes me days to recover.\n\nThe interesting thing about all of this is that people who know me would never guess that I feel this way. I\u2019ve become quite good at hiding it over the years; I\u2019m a highly-functioning introvert. Even many of my good friends would never believe the sky-rocketing anxiety level I hide on a daily basis. I think this is one of the reasons I\u2019ve always enjoyed writing. It\u2019s my safe place. I can say or do things in the worlds I create that I would never do in real life. Writing is my escape, and I\u2019m happy that it\u2019s also my career. I\u2019m blessed to be able to do what I love every day.\n\nBut there\u2019s a catch! The thing I never realized until I had my first book published is that there comes a time when an author has to leave the safe haven of her writing cave and venture out and mingle amongst the scary world. In my personal publishing journey, this has been the hardest part.\n\nWhat I didn\u2019t realize until my first book was published is that it doesn\u2019t matter how fantastic my book is if no one knows it exists. Books don\u2019t sell themselves- authors do. I quickly understood that my ability to handle my anxiety would be tested, and that was terrifying. You see, in order to let people know about my book, I was going to have to put myself out there. I was going to have to do things that made me horribly uncomfortable. I was going to have to step way outside of my comfort zone, and I was going to have to live there. So, I took a deep breath, told myself that I had no choice, and I did it.\n\nOver the past couple of years, I\u2019ve done things I never thought I could do. I\u2019ve hosted book signings and author events. I\u2019ve done radio and newspaper interviews. I\u2019ve sat on author panels, and I\u2019ve given talks at libraries and schools. I\u2019ve even been on television.\n\nWell-meaning people keep telling me that the more I do these things, the easier they will get, but I know this isn\u2019t true. I\u2019ve suffered from anxiety my entire life. I\u2019ve always been an introvert pretending to be an extrovert. Standing in the spotlight never gets easier.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve discovered, though, is that as I push through the anxiety, I realize that I\u2019m more capable than I ever gave myself credit for. You see, I\u2019ve discovered that if I just keep trying, I can do anything I set my mind to. I might not do it perfectly, and I might completely fail. Even if I don\u2019t, I\u2019m still my own worst critic. But I\u2019ve also learned that it\u2019s important to give myself permission to fail. It\u2019s important to be as gracious and forgiving of myself as I would be with my family and friends. None of us is perfect, no matter how hard we try. We\u2019re all just muddling through life doing the best we can.\n\nI\u2019ve learned so much about myself since publishing my first book. I\u2019ve learned how strong I really am. I\u2019ve learned that I\u2019m tenacious, and I refuse to give up. I\u2019ve learned that fear can either paralyze you or propel you; I choose to be propelled. I\u2019ve learned that I can do things, in spite of crippling anxiety that often tells me otherwise. I\u2019ve learned that sometimes the very best thing that can happen is being forced outside of your comfort zone- because that\u2019s where real growth takes place.\n\nOriginally published at wp.me", "url": "https://www.thriveglobal.com/stories/15743-anxiety-and-publishing-choose-to-be-propelled", "summary": "Even many of my good friends would never believe the sky-rocketing anxiety level I hide on a daily basis.\nI quickly understood that my ability to handle my anxiety would be tested, and that was terrifying.\nI\u2019ve suffered from anxiety my entire life.\nWhat I\u2019ve discovered, though, is that as I push through the anxiety, I realize that I\u2019m more capable than I ever gave myself credit for.\nI\u2019ve learned that I can do things, in spite of crippling anxiety that often tells me otherwise.", "timescraped": 1513925421.039299, "category": {"words": 769, "personal": 56, "thirdperson": 2, "condition": 4, "recovery": 0}}, "1b455c9255394247b7c1b7f880c35099": {"title": "Parenting in the Age of Stress:", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/skinner-production/stories/featured_images/000/014/835/large/london-scout-41030.jpg?1507680512", "text": "\n\nAs the parent of my own young children and having worked with many parents over the years, I can say there may be nothing in life that brings greater fulfillment than being a parent. However, it also brings tremendous stress.\n\nIn fact, the very idea of striving to be a good parent can be a source of significant stress. Most of us are acutely aware when we are falling short of this ideal and we can become plagued by a sense of guilt and shame. It\u2019s not your fault. The cultural expectations for parents continues to increase, while shared care-taking of children has decreased. This shift has caused an enormous burden on parents to fulfill all their children\u2019s basic needs, and live up to societal expectations of working hard in a successful career while simultaneously ensuring your child is a socially sensitive and well-rounded Ivy League graduate. The deck is stacked against us.\n\nThis nearly impossible standard of being a \u201cgood parent,\u201d that many of us tacitly agreed to, intensifies the pressure and constant stress that not only creates a slew of health issues for us, but gets passed down to our children, who are also becoming stressed out in huge numbers. Yes, stress is contagious, particularly when it\u2019s passed from parent to child. In her article, \u201cThe Epidemic of Stressed Parents Raising Stressed Kids: From Generation X to Generation Stress\u201d Kristin Race, Ph.D. argues that all the stress that parents are experiencing, is causing a whole new generation of stressed out children. She cites statistics showing that anxiety and depression are on the rise for elementary school students and that 20% of all school-aged children have a diagnosable mental disorder. In one telling bit of research, she reports Xanex is often now the \u201cdrug of choice\u201d for teens.\n\nSo, how do we put the brakes on all of this and reclaim our balance? To begin, stop and put the oxygen mask on yourself first. Just as stress is contagious, so are other emotions. When we are able to reduce our own stress and increase our joy, this too is passed along to our family. Our children will benefit immensely when we are less stressed and feeling more at ease. So instead of trying to manage our children\u2019s emotions and behavior so much, perhaps our children would be better served by us managing our own stress. Thankfully, there are many things we can do to manage our stress.\n\nDrop out of the Rat Race - There\u2019s a wise saying that even if you win the rat race, you\u2019re still a rat. You don\u2019t have to buy into the expectations that our culture puts on parents. Nor do you have to place your own self-worth on meeting impossibly high expectations. Prioritize what is important to you about being a parent and then let that be your guide. Comparing yourself to other parents and trying to keep up with them is often a recipe for more stress for you and your kids. Practice Mindfulness Meditation - Participants in courses like Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) have shown significant reductions in stress. Regular mindfulness meditation practice is an effective tool for managing stress. I developed a Stress Reduction mindfulness meditation series on the Evenflow App which I highly encourage you to try out. This can be a wonderful way to support yourself as you encounter the trials and tribulations of parenting in the modern world. Even practicing as little as 10 minutes per day, can have positive effects. Self-Compassion - Parenting is hard enough without beating ourselves up. We all make mistakes and act in ways towards our children that are not ideal. Realize you are doing the best you can, given your circumstances and history. This is not to condone continuing harmful behavior, but rather a compassionate acknowledgment of the way things are. When you approach yourself with compassion, the natural extension of that is to behave in caring and non-harming ways towards yourself and others. Be Present and Notice the Good - Set aside time each day to put away all distractions and just be present with your child. This can be tough, but even for a few minutes a day try to put aside any agenda other than just being with your child and fully present. Stress rises when multiple things are demanding our attention. By taking time to devote our attention to just our child we setting the stage for a lower stress, better quality interaction. See if you might also notice their good qualities during the interaction. Get a sense of what it feels like to really enjoy being with your child. Accept Some Stress - It\u2019s not possible or even ideal to get rid of all stress. Some stress is helpful and gives us the focus and energy we need to tackle everyday problems. So instead of striving to get rid of stress totally, aim for moderating your stress so that it doesn\u2019t become toxic. The Bigger Picture - It can sometimes be hard to recognize the difference between big deals and little deals in parenting. We often worry that one behavior is going to expand into a full blown character flaw later in life. It\u2019s very difficult to \u201ctrust the process\u201d of growing up. And yet, somehow we all developed into adults. Asking yourself, \u201cis this going to matter (next week, month, or five years from now)\u201d will help give you some much needed perspective when your child is refusing to eat their vegetables. Recognize Your Limits - It\u2019s okay to say no. Your child will survive if they don't do everything. I love the acronym HALT. If I am Hungry, Angry, Lonely, or Tired, I need to take steps to care for myself or risk causing harm to myself or others. Seething resentment makes you and everyone around you miserable. It is far better to pause and care for yourself rather than plunge forward with a bad attitude.\n\nThere is no getting around it - parenting in the modern age is stressful. We feel it, our partner if we have one feels it, and most of all our kids feel it. However, you can be the one who injects more calm and ease in your family. By letting go of what everyone else thinks is important, connecting with what is most important to you as a parent, and reducing your own stress you can reclaim the balance your family and you desire.

And mindfulness is attunement to today\u2019s demands to avoid tomorrow\u2019s difficulties.\u201d\n\n~Dr. Ellen Langer, Harvard University [1]\n\nToo many companies have discovered only after it\u2019s far too late to course correct that yesterday\u2019s solutions have an expiration date. Blackberry, Yahoo, Kodak, Blockbuster, and Sony are examples of companies that didn\u2019t respond early enough to signals that once dominant products and services were no longer relevant to consumers. In the new economy, organizations can no longer afford to let mindless patterns and ingrained ways of thinking and doing drag them down. Nonetheless, the challenge is that people\u2019s brains can get so overwhelmed by change and uncertainty that they cannot think straight, create, or innovate.[2]\n\nA portrayal of mindlessness, image courtesy of Pixabay\n\nIn my work as a neuroscience-based leadership consultant, I have found that many executives are baffled by how management practices that worked in the past no longer apply to today. In the old economy, it was possible to execute according to a five-year strategic plan and anticipate how the world would evolve. Today, it is getting harder and harder to predict and forecast even six months to one year into the future. No one can tell when a new technology will revolutionize their particular field or industry. No one knows how long certain expertise or skills will remain relevant. No one can anticipate when what they do for work will become obsolete.\n\nYet some things haven\u2019t changed. Human beings still don\u2019t like uncertainty. We still don\u2019t like losing our sense of control. We still don\u2019t like having the rug pulled from under our feet. We still resist change. These responses are still normal because it is the way we are biologically wired. Change, uncertainty, disruption, and unpredictability trigger our brains and bodies to unleash high levels of stress hormones that put us into a state of fight-flight-freeze.[2]\n\nTo make brain science easy to understand in the Calm Clarity Mindful Leadership Program, I describe the underlying neural structures of the fight-flight-freeze system as Brain 1.0. When Brain 1.0 gets activated, it reduces blood flow to our frontal lobes, thus impeding our ability to think clearly and respond effectively to challenges. When our frontal lobes are impaired, we essentially become \u201cmindless\u201d (the book Scarcity explains that under stress, people\u2019s IQ may drop by an entire standard deviation [3]). Without fully functioning frontal lobes, we can\u2019t come up with new solutions. So in that state, we tend to throw whatever we\u2019ve seen work in the past at the problem and hope it will go away.\n\nGiven the fast pace of modern society, people have accepted stress and anxiety as part of the fabric of everyday life, but most have not yet found healthy and effective ways to cope. Many organizations that have embraced the philosophy of \u201cwork hard, play hard\u201d activate the reward system as a means to motivate people without realizing it also unintentionally discourages self-care, rest and rejuvenation. Medication has become one of the most common forms of coping as suggested by the rise of the twenty billion dollar anti-depressant and anti-anxiety market.[4, 5] To get relief, people also turn to alcohol, marijuana, and comfort eating \u2014 activities which further imbalance the reward / dopamine system and increase the risk of addiction and other health problems.\n\nTo make brain science easy to understand, I think of the neural structures of the reward system as Brain 2.0. When Brain 2.0 is highly activated, our chase for rewards (such as status, wealth, immediate gratification, instantaneous relief from anxiety and pain) become all-or-nothing fixations that impair the functioning of our frontal lobes. Brain 2.0 compels us to look for quick fixes that merely stick band-aids on symptoms rather than perform the learning, thinking and reflection required to truly understand underlying root causes and design effective solutions to address them.\n\nMost conversations about stress focus on the negative impact on health, but we don\u2019t focus enough on the negative impact on cognition: how it reduces our ability to learn, take in new information, be open to new opportunities, see the bigger picture, and build meaningful connections \u2014 in other words, how it makes us mindless. Essentially, stress causes a well-documented phenomena called cognitive tunneling: when people are only able to see what is directly in the center of their field of vision and become \u201cblind\u201d to the periphery. Cognitively tunneling can cause serious consequences and even disasters.\n\nImage courtesy of Pixabay\n\nIn his most recent book, Smarter Faster Better: The Secrets of Being Productive in Life and Business, Charles Duhigg explained that cognitive tunneling was responsible for one of the worst accidents in aviation history due to human error \u2014 the crash of Air France Flight 447 in which 228 people lost their lives. The recovered black box recording showed that after a minor mechanical issue caused an alert signal, the pilot had gotten completely fixated on the information coming in from the panel right in front of him and ignored all the other readings. The misguided action plan he took based on reading that one instrument caused the plane to crash.\n\nAccording to Duhigg, \u201cCognitive tunneling can cause people to become overly focused on whatever is directly in front of their eyes or become preoccupied with immediate tasks. It\u2019s what keeps someone glued to their smartphone as the kids wail or pedestrians swerve around them on the sidewalk. It\u2019s what causes drivers to slam on their brakes when they see a red light ahead.\u201d[6]\n\nIn the business world, cognitive tunneling is a mental state in which managers and leaders become myopically focused on the issue that is right in front of them or top of mind and fail to see what is happening in the rest of their environment and to seek out other relevant data. It is a state in which Brain 1.0 and Brain 2.0 overreact to one piece of information / one story and cause us to miss the bigger picture. It is a state in which we become blind to emerging opportunities for growth and innovation. For the most part, leaders have underestimated the degree to which cognitive tunneling and other forms of mindlessness have hurt and impeded their companies. This is partly because once we are in a cognitive tunnel, we get so locked into it that we aren\u2019t aware we are in one.\n\nOne could make an argument that cognitive tunneling is one of the many underlying factors in corporate scandals and crises. For instance, Wells Fargo developed a myopic fixation on increasing cross-selling (by tracking the average number of products per customers as a performance metric) which led employees to open fake accounts in consumers\u2019 names so the could get rewarded with higher pay. When this unethical practice finally came to light as one of the worst bank abuses in modern history, the tunnel vision was finally lifted, leaving management baffled as to how the corporation had gotten so derailed.[7, 8]\n\nWhat leaders need to understand is that even in the absence of greed and wrong-doing, in normal everyday life, mindlessness happens all the time. Using the frontal lobes burns a lot of fuel, so the brain evolved the autopilot as an energy efficient mechanism for storing lessons and skills into Brain 2.0. Once people have repeatedly done something over and over, that skill/learning gets coded into our autopilot as a habit/reflex, so the frontal lobes don\u2019t have to burn energy each time we do it (in fact, when neuroscientists observe people do an activity without the frontal lobes being activated, they conclude that they are doing it on autopilot).[9] This frees up our conscious minds to do other activities. For example, our autopilot allows us to walk and push a shopping cart while our minds make plans for dinner. Our autopilot allows us to drive while our minds hold an engaging conversation. The challenge is that numerous activities can get relegated to the autopilot that are much better performed with conscious awareness and presence.\n\nWhen people slip into autopilot mode and stop consciously thinking about what they are doing on a regular basis, this is where mindlessness presents itself. Because businesses gain scale and efficiency through standardizing processes and using incentives tied to metrics to manage employee behaviors, businesses are highly susceptible to mindlessness. When people stop thinking, they not only stop innovating, they are more likely to make costly mistakes and errors in judgment. To prevent falling into the trap of mindlessness \u2014 that is where mindfulness comes in.\n\nEllen Langer, a professor at Harvard University who is one of the world\u2019s foremost researchers on mindfulness, defines it as \u201cthe simple act of actively noticing new things and challenging our natural human tendencies to be inattentive over time.\u201d[10] Interestingly, Langer\u2019s research on mindfulness has nothing to do with meditation or yoga. She focuses on people\u2019s nuanced ability to discern how each moment is different from the one before and keep themselves from falling into a mindless autopilot mode.[11] In the Zen tradition, this corresponds to a notion called \u201cbeginner\u2019s mind\u201d \u2014 the ability to experience any activity in life, no matter how mundane, with childlike curiosity as if you are doing it for the first time.\n\nTo make neuroscience intuitively simple, I like referring to the frontal lobes as Brain 3.0. The easiest way to explain brain functioning is through the maxim: \u201c Use it or lose it.\u201d If you want to keep the Brain 3.0 on, you have to proactively and intentionally activate the neural pathways within it. The frontal lobes activate when we learn new things, when we experience awe, wonder and curiosity, when we are being creative, when we ponder questions without simple answers like riddles, when we try to see a bigger picture, when we connect to something bigger than ourselves, when we make deep meaningful connections with people, and when we empathically listen for understanding.\n\nMindfulness essentially involves cultivating a state of mind that keeps us in Brain 3.0. It\u2019s not an easy thing to do because the brain is hardwired to go into autopilot mode to save energy. So this is where turning to meditation and yoga can be helpful because these techniques teach us how to cultivate mindfulness by observing and watching our autopilot, learning what got stored in there, and identifying when what\u2019s in our autopilot no longer serves us. Only then can we re-train our autopilots by replacing obsolete habits with better ones.[12] This is why rewiring our brains for mindfulness eventually results in gaining inner freedom from self-limiting patterns and beliefs.\n\nOnce Brain 3.0 is sufficiently strengthened through mindfulness practices, it becomes more resilient to stress (meaning it is not easily deactivated by the fight-flight-freeze cascade) and is able to stay on without slipping completely into autopilot mode. By staying \u201con,\u201d Brain 3.0 can help us avoid the traps of cognitive tunneling and other forms of mindlessness. By staying \u201con,\u201d Brain 3.0 enables us to be our best selves through any difficult challenge.\n\nBusinesses need as many people as possible to fully develop and cultivate Brain 3.0 and use it to become attuned with the dynamic changes happening in their industries and in the larger world as a whole. Moreover, businesses need mindful leaders who have sufficient horsepower in Brain 3.0 to respond effectively to changing circumstances and to identify and embrace opportunities for growth.\n\nTo help people understand how their brain functions and how shifting out of Brain 1.0 and 2.0 into Brain 3.0 can transform their life at work and at home, I developed the Calm Clarity Mindful Leadership Program in 2013. Since then we have shared the benefits of Brain 3.0 with many organizations, including leading companies such as M&T Bank, Vanguard, Bristol-Meyers Squibb, Ernst & Young, and Devereux Advanced Behavioral Heath as well as leading institutions such as the University of Pennsylvania and New York University.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article and would like to make the shift into Brain 3.0, please consider joining a Calm Clarity Weekend Retreat.

What are the possible emotions and how does one look and act when feeling each one? For older children, families can talk about what people may feel in various situations. This is a helpful activity for teenagers because it allows them to gain perspective. For younger children, note cards can be used to teach names and facial expressions for certain emotions.\n\nThese are examples of common emotions. Notice how well you can define each:\n\nJoy \u2014 a feeling of great pleasure or happiness\n\nAnger \u2014 a strong feeling of annoyance or hostility\n\nSadness \u2014 a state of sorrow or regret\n\nBoredom \u2014 a state of tiredness due to disinterest\n\nEmbarrassment \u2014 a state of awkwardness, self-consciousness or shame\n\nFigure out what triggers emotions. Think about what creates happiness, what causes sadness. Be aware of what instances elicit anger or joy. Adults can share these instances with children and parents should point out triggers to children. Be sure to do this during neutral times. If your child is angry because her friend won\u2019t talk to her, my advice would be not to catch her just after she hangs out with her friends to discuss her social trigger. Talk with her during dinner at home or on the way to sports practice. If you need a starter for this conversation, start by saying, \u201cI notice you seem angry when \u2026. What do you think about my observation?\u201d\n\nProvide plenty of simple options for coping with difficult emotions. There is no one way to handle feelings of disappointment or anger, but there are healthy and unhealthy ways of dealing with challenging emotions. An unhealthy way of dealing with anger might be to throw a tantrum and harm the feelings of another person by yelling at or hurting someone else. A quick way to understand if a coping mechanism is unhealthy is if it causes harm or stress to a person. Instead, a child who is feeling anger could be taught to take deep breaths, use visualization techniques, and/or journal about triggers or events which cause him or her feelings of anger.\n\nTry any of these healthy coping strategies:\n\nBreathing \u2014 smelling the flowers and blowing out the candles\n\nExercise \u2014 move in a way you love\n\nMusic \u2014 listen to music which you enjoy\n\nArt \u2014 sketch, color or create something\n\nTalk \u2014 talk with someone about your feelings\n\nMeditation \u2014 practice daily mindfulness meditation\n\nGain perspective \u2014 Read a book or watch a movie; realize emotions come and then go. The uncomfortable feelings pass.\n\nKnow when to partner with professionals for help. Students who struggle with emotional health and well-being may need to consult with a medical professional. If you are ever unsure if you need support, it never does hurt to ask, but certainly ask if a child is suffering with his or her functioning in any way. Sometimes what begins as a smaller issue, builds to a larger issue, because it was never properly addressed. Habits are formed over time and can be difficult to break and reteach. If your child needs professional help, be sure to be grateful for modern medicine and work hard to define your child as more than his or her emotional struggles. When nothing seems to be working, ask, \u201cWhat is working?\u201d And always keep a list of your child\u2019s gifts and talents.", "url": "https://journal.thriveglobal.com/essentials-for-emotional-well-being-faab1cc61d8c", "summary": "For older children, families can talk about what people may feel in various situations.\nFor younger children, note cards can be used to teach names and facial expressions for certain emotions.\nAdults can share these instances with children and parents should point out triggers to children.\nAn unhealthy way of dealing with anger might be to throw a tantrum and harm the feelings of another person by yelling at or hurting someone else.\nStudents who struggle with emotional health and well-being may need to consult with a medical professional.", "timescraped": 1513925428.34657, "category": {"words": 546, "personal": 0, "thirdperson": 12, "condition": 0, "recovery": 1}}, "937c909379a949cabd07b3b7f5180916": {"title": "Puerto Rico is Facing a Mental Health Crisis After Hurricane Maria", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/skinner-production/stories/featured_images/000/017/038/large/37971915731_66dcfd3210_k.jpg?1510689500", "text": "After the devastation of Hurricane Maria, the road to rebuilding includes restoring power, rebuilding homes and making sure there\u2019s clean water. But it also includes addressing a looming mental health crisis, Caitlin Dickerson writes in the New York Times, and in Puerto Rico, there may not be enough resources to address any of these problems.\n\nHurricane Maria tore through Puerto Rico on September 20th, bringing with it \u201cviolent winds and screeching rains,\u201d Dickerson writes. While the storm left visible, infrastructural damage, it was also a \u201c72-hour assault on the Puerto Rican psyche,\u201d she adds. Health workers are preparing for a population in distress, experiencing symptoms of post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depression, much like after Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. And \u201cin New Orleans, many people experienced insomnia, cognitive impairment and short-term memory loss,\u201d Dickerson notes.\n\nTo complicate things, Puerto Rico was already struggling to treat a rise in mental illnesses before Maria, following a 10-year recession that \u201cbrought soaring unemployment, poverty and family separation caused by migration,\u201d according to Dickerson. The mental health division of the Puerto Rico health department got $3 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help respond to the current crisis as Suzanne Roig, the administrator of the Puerto Rican agency, told the Times. The agency has also been monitoring social media and has \u201cstaged interventions in a handful of homes of people who posted what appeared to be suicide notes\u201d online, Dickerson writes.\n\nMental health needs after a traumatic event vary. In the wake of Hurricane Maria, some people are \u201creporting intense feelings of anxiety and depression for the first time in their lives,\u201d Dickerson writes, while others with existing conditions may struggle to get their medicine or follow the routine they need to stay healthy.\n\nThere have been more than 2,000 calls to an emergency hotline for psychiatric crises maintained by the Puerto Rican health department since the storm hit, which is \u201cdouble the normal number for that period, even though most residents still do not have working phones,\u201d Dickerson writes. Officials report that there have been 32 suicides since the storm, and that \u201cmany more people than normal have been hospitalized after being deemed dangerous to themselves or others.\u201d\n\nClinical psychologist Dr. Carlos del Toro told the Times that in more than 20 years of practice he\u2019d never hospitalized as many people with homicidal or suicidal thoughts in such a short amount of time as he has since Maria hit. He said that out of around 2,500 people who came to an emergency health clinic in Toa Baja, one of the most severely impacted areas in Puerto Rico, more than 90 percent of them were recommended for mental health screening. \u201cDr. Toro said he had been frantically calling for help from colleagues in other cities because the facility was overrun with people in need of mental health care,\u201d Dickerson writes.\n\nAnd for those experiencing new or existing mental health concerns, returning to some semblance of normalcy is key after a traumatic incident like a storm, physicians and public health officials told the Times. But that is considerably more difficult seeing as the hallmarks of routine, like power and water or an open office or school, aren\u2019t yet available.\n\n\u201cAll this is happening at once,\u201d Dr. Domingo Marqu\u00e9s, the director of clinical psychology at Albizu University, told Dickerson. \u201cWhat we have lost is the foundation that holds a society together.\u201d He added that the very definition of normalcy changes after an event like Hurricane Maria: \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018I survived.

In it, Leo McGarry tells Josh Lyman:\n\n\u201cThis guy\u2019s walking down the street when he falls in a hole. The walls are so steep he can\u2019t get out.\n\n\u201cA doctor passes by and the guy shouts up, \u2018Hey you.

Our guy says, \u2018Are you stupid? Now we\u2019re both down here.\u2019\n\nThe friend says, \u2018Yeah, but I\u2019ve been down here before and I know the way out.'\u201d\n\nThe West Wing, Season 2, Episode 10 No\u00ebl.\n\nI have been trying to find my way out for years. Feeling trapped by anxiety, I have sought help from anyone and everyone. It took years, but finally, I found the way out. I hope that my story helps others to see that there is hope and there is a way to get better.\n\nThe New Me\n\nI remember the first time I presented to 240 people at a conference in the U.S. As little as two years before, I would have been beside myself with terror, hyperventilating and unable to speak. I probably would have said no to the opportunity. Now, I enjoy the challenge. But curing my speaking anxiety is only a happy side-effect of the Thrive Programme.\n\nA few months before that, I went to the dentist to complete the treatment of a tooth that had given me a toothache for over 4 years before I even started treatment. I did not go sooner because I was TERRIFIED of the dentist! At this last of many visits, I greeted the nurse with a smile, and proclaimed to the dentist that I was very well, \u201cafter all, what could be better than to start the day with a 7 am dentist appointment \u2013 my favorite thing!\u201d But curing my intense anxiety about dentists is only a happy side-effect of the coaching program that I went through.\n\nThink about it. I put up with a chronic toothache for four years because I was afraid of the dentist. I did not have my teeth straightened because I was afraid of the dentist. I avoided cleanings and checkups because I was afraid of the dentist. All my dental treatment since I was sixteen has been emergency treatment \u2026 because I was afraid of the dentist.\n\nThe Old Me: Daily \u2013 and Nightly \u2013 Misery\n\nThe real reason I went through the Thrive Programme was to overcome a lifelong struggle with emetophobia. If you aren\u2019t familiar with that term, it is no surprise. Even therapists look at me blankly when I tell them what I had. Emetophobia is a pathological fear of people \u2013 in my case myself and anyone else \u2013 vomiting. Even the words vomit, throw-up, sick etc. would send a chill down my spine. I could not watch scenes on TV or in movies where the characters threw up. Although during the 45 years I suffered from this phobia, I did not tell many people that I had it, those that I did tell would well-meaningly say \u201cOh yes, I don\u2019t like it either\u201d or \u201cWhen people throw up in front of me I feel that I will throw up too\u201d. They were being kind. But they had no idea.\n\nEvery waking moment of my day there was a tape running in my head about what might happen and how I could avoid it. I would scan continuously for signs that people around me were feeling unwell. It didn\u2019t matter if they were unwell with a cold, a broken leg, or a stomach upset, every ailment raised my anxiety levels through the roof. Pain can make people vomit, stress can make them vomit, a cold, a bug, bad food, too much to drink, spinning around too much \u2013 you name it, I could link it to the potential, no, the likelihood that they would vomit.\n\nEvery waking moment of my day I was anticipating situations that could expose me to \u201crisky\u201d situations. I would think ahead to meetings and plan where I should sit. I would turn down social invitations \u2013 no pubs, clubs, restaurants, theaters, sports venues, etc. Every moment of the day I would think about the possible awkward conversations I might have and plan my answers \u2013 always with the intent of avoiding social & group situations, travel on public transport, driving others in the back of my car, traveling in the back of someone else\u2019s car, going on a long or slow elevator ride, traveling by boat, plane, bus or train.\n\nAt night, I dreamed of situations where other people were vomiting. I would awake breathless and clammy and would have to double check that I did not feel ill myself. For years, I did not vomit even if I felt like death warmed over. Better to feel awful than to experience \u2026what? Death? Embarrassment? I cannot even really say what I was afraid of. It felt worse than death. It felt worse than sitting on the cold bathroom floor rocking back and forth praying that I would not succumb.\n\nLosing Ground\n\nI missed a term of college because someone left the room abruptly in the middle of a lecture. Spending time with friends who threw up at a party or missed school or work was no longer an option. I gave up eating food that had on one occasion made me nauseous. When I did travel, I carried a pillow liner and my own pillow case so I would not be exposed to the germs of the last occupier. I canceled trips, dates, and events because when the time came I could not face them. I turned down promotions and changed jobs because I would have to travel more by plane and with colleagues. And friends or family in the hospital could not expect a visit \u2013 for obvious reasons.\n\nOne weekend I was chatting with my partner about my job, waxing lyrical about how much I was enjoying the role. By Tuesday I had been offered a promotion and had been told I would need to travel to our overseas offices on a regular basis. I longed to say yes, but instead came home to my partner and announced it was time to leave the job, the work was untenable, management unreasonable, I was done! As you can imagine, my partner struggled to reconcile this attitude with my enthusiasm for the job only two days prior!\n\nEventually, I was asked to come to the US for work. I tried to find ways to avoid the trip, I again considered a job change, but at the time it was not practical. The Economic recession meant we were all hanging on to whatever job we could get. Somehow, I managed to get to the U.S. and once there, did not return for four months (three months longer than the original plan). I missed family plans and skipped commitments in the U.K. because I could not get home for the promised monthly visit.\n\nLife continued in the same way. I felt that more than half my energy was being used in managing my phobia. I tried therapy, counseling, medication. Nothing worked. All I did was spend large amounts of money, all to no avail. Life was becoming smaller and smaller\u2026 (To be continued)\n\nOriginally published at www.alle2thrive.com", "url": "https://www.thriveglobal.com/stories/12987-overcome-anxiety-part-1-from-emetophobic-to-thriving", "summary": "Now we\u2019re both down here.\u2019The friend says, \u2018Yeah, but I\u2019ve been down here before and I know the way out.\nFeeling trapped by anxiety, I have sought help from anyone and everyone.\nBut curing my speaking anxiety is only a happy side-effect of the Thrive Programme.\nAll my dental treatment since I was sixteen has been emergency treatment \u2026 because I was afraid of the dentist.\nIt didn\u2019t matter if they were unwell with a cold, a broken leg, or a stomach upset, every ailment raised my anxiety levels through the roof.", "timescraped": 1513925400.810394, "category": {"words": 1313, "personal": 91, "thirdperson": 8, "condition": 3, "recovery": 0}}, "7203c25d183d69bb34b22dfbc46fe278": {"title": "How To Finally Break Up With Anxiety", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/skinner-production/stories/featured_images/000/014/308/large/anxiety.jpg?1506886504", "text": "In The Concept of Anxiety, Soren Kierkegaard proclaimed:\n\n\u201c\u2026But he who becomes guilty through anxiety is indeed innocent, for it was not he himself but anxiety, a foreign power, that laid hold of him, a power that he did not love but about which he was anxious. And yet he is guilty, for he sank in anxiety, which he nevertheless loved as he feared it.\u201d\n\nHaving anxiety is like falling in love with the wrong person. Initially we are seduced by the promises of safety, comfort and reliance. We are attracted to constantly worrying because we think it protects us from a potentially harmful future. We fall victim to anxiety\u2019s temptations because we are scared of what the future holds, and ruminating about potential outcomes gives us the impression that we are safe.\n\nLike any bad relationship, the short honeymoon phase leads to a long, debilitating decline. See, anxiety is the jealous-type, so any time we try to spend time away from it, it continues to text and call until we pick up. It gets angry with us when we decide to spend time with our friends and family. It incessantly nags us throughout the day, constantly needing our attention and support. As a result, the activities that used to brings us joy turn sour because anxiety is attached to our hip.\n\nAt this point we realize that it is time to finally break up with anxiety. Our commitment has led us to self-destructive habits, negativity and the inability to enjoy life. As hard as it is to break up with something that at one time we thought would help us feel safe, it is time to move forward and live freely.\n\nHowever, it is harder to end this relationship than we initially thought. Even though we fight and argue everyday, for some reason we grow closer because of it. The more we fight, the more we know that deep down anxiety cares about us. The make-up sex is great, or in other words, protecting ourselves from hurt and ruminating about potential made up \u201cWhat-if\u201d scenarios feels natural and easy and safe.\n\nEven though it is difficult, we must find a way to overcome. Not only will a new start help our well being in the present, but our future will shine much brighter as well. Like any bad break-up, overcoming this struggle will tell us more about our true being, what we really want in life, and what is most important to us.\n\nIn this way, anxiety is truly a gateway to happiness. Once we sever ties and are able to live the good life of freedom and peace, we are going to look back and ask ourselves, \u201cWhat did I ever see in this person?\u201d\n\nHere are the steps to finally saying \u201cdeuces\u201d to anxiety:\n\nREAD ABOUT IT\n\nAnxiety is a foreign habit in our minds. It is an opponent that we have to defeat. Like a competitor in business or in sports, anxiety is in direct opposition to our happiness and success.\n\nIf we want to defeat our competition, it is best to study it. It is best to learn about its tendencies, weaknesses and drawbacks. It is through this knowledge that we can exploit its weaknesses and become victorious.\n\nWhen I was first hit with crippling anxiety that resulted in depression and daily crying and shaking panic attacks, I was paralyzed. However it was this trauma that motivated me to read over 100 books in 6 months. Through my incessant reading I not only gained many lifetimes\u2019 worth of wisdom that helped my overthinking, but I gained generations worth of insight into myself.\n\nEven though I began reading in search of a cure for my anxiety, I actually found the antidote that freed me from my demons.\n\nIf anxiety hadn\u2019t motivated me to take action, I may have lived my entire life without truly knowing myself. If we choose to see it, anxiety is a wonderful gift of self-discovery.\n\nATTACK THE PROBLEM AT ITS SOURCE\n\nAnxiety can either cripple us into stagnation or motivate us to act. The choice is ours.\n\nOnce we make the correct decision to take action, it is very important to choose our actions wisely. Many of us counter anxiety by devoting our lives to our careers. Many deal with anxiety by trying to attract another companion for support. Others fight their anxiety by focusing on monetary success and power.\n\nUnfortunately, these distractions will always point us into the wrong direction.\n\nUsing our wonderful anxiety motivation on other unrelated pursuits is like procrastinating in our studying for that upcoming Monday final. We think that partying Friday and Saturday and half of Sunday will help us enjoy our weekend, but realistically our time is spent constantly worrying about failing the test. Not only are we putting off the inevitable, but we are stripping ourselves of the ability to enjoy the present.\n\nFor example, when I was hit with a major OCD and anxiety disorder, my choice of action was career motivated. For 5 months, I spent 12 hours a day studying and reading about my career and spent almost all of my savings attending networking events across the country. Eventually, I got the job that I wanted!\n\nHowever, when I got the call that I was hired, I so anxious and worried that I convinced myself that the guy said that I was NOT hired. For the next two weeks until I heard back from the company, I worried ceaselessly convincing myself of the \u201cWhat-if\u201d scenario that my boss told me that I DIDN\u2019T get the job.\n\nIn the end, I got everything that I thought that I wanted, except for the power to accept it.\n\nOnce I focused primarily on solving my anxiety and mental state, my subjective well being skyrocketed. Additionally, it was through correctly directed focus that I developed clarity on my purpose, personal values and the direction of my life.\n\nPRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE\n\nThere is no easy, get-rich-quick way to end anxiety. It will always take time, patience and consistent practice.\n\nControlling our anxiety is a skill. As with any skill, the more consistent effort and time that we devote, the better at it we get. If we create consistent habits of meditation, personal reflection, exercise and healthy living, we will get better with each day.\n\nFinally, anxiety can be the start of an amazing and deeply emotional journey. It is truly a stepping-stone to a more fulfilled life. Anxiety can be the motivation that propels us forward into places and mindsets and outlooks that we would have never thought possible. It can be the key to our happiness if we take the correct action.\n\nWhen anxiety began to control my life, I was without purpose, goals or well-being. I was an alcoholic, defensive and trapped in my own interpretations of what I thought the world was like. It was only through consistent effort to take back control of my mind did I find meaning, develop important goals and learn to love life as it is.\n\nWhile a crippling anxiety habit can seem insurmountable at first, we must use it as a drive to understand our minds. Once we conquer our minds, we can really do anything we want.\n\nAs the old saying goes, \u201cConquer yourself and the world lies at your feet.\u201d\n\nIF YOU WANT TO LEARN MORE\u2026\n\nIt is my dream to help those with anxiety and depression heal FASTER and MORE EFFICIENTLY. After overcoming the effects of 15 years of child abuse, chronic depression and crippling anxiety, I know more than anyone how important it is to recover as quickly as possible.\n\nIn my personal healing process, Thoreau\u2019s Walden inspired me. Thus, I chose to isolate myself from all technology, social media, and people for over 6 months in search for answers. I walked over 3,500 miles, read over 150 books and tried many different therapies, anxiety drugs, religions and theories to further understand the human mind.\n\nIt is through this extreme and rare action that I gathered extremely rare insights. For the last two years, I have been testing out my completely original blueprint for creating a healthy and happy mind. Through trials and tribulations, I have figured out a NEW method of overcoming negative habits of overthinking that cripple our lives.\n\nIf you are interested in overcoming your anxiety habit and connecting with yourself and what you want in life in the process, my FREE EBOOK about trading anxiety and doubt and depression for a life of happiness comes out THIS MONTH. I know that my new methods will help you just as much as they helped me.\n\nTo find the book, please connect with me on LinkedIn (Kevin Roche, Director of Creative Content for Peerbuds Innovation Lab) or visit my recently published website, https://lightthroughtheleaves.com/.", "url": "https://www.thriveglobal.com/stories/14308-how-to-finally-break-up-with-anxiety", "summary": "And yet he is guilty, for he sank in anxiety, which he nevertheless loved as he feared it.\u201dHaving anxiety is like falling in love with the wrong person.\nAs a result, the activities that used to brings us joy turn sour because anxiety is attached to our hip.\nAt this point we realize that it is time to finally break up with anxiety.\nIf anxiety hadn\u2019t motivated me to take action, I may have lived my entire life without truly knowing myself.\nFinally, anxiety can be the start of an amazing and deeply emotional journey.", "timescraped": 1513925402.319792, "category": {"words": 1435, "personal": 115, "thirdperson": 10, "condition": 31, "recovery": 1}}, "943e52a3ad25692d13fa1d7465ca9acb": {"title": "The Antidote To Anxiety", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/skinner-production/stories/featured_images/000/011/122/large/StockSnap_FJPBVKMQZH.jpg?1501191925", "text": "This morning I woke up feeling relatively collected and stable, an uncharacteristic yet welcomed sensation to accompany me throughout my day. I finished my chores before settling down for a cup of tea; I can\u2019t drink coffee anymore\u2014yep, anxiety. But, as I took note of this rare imposter of calm stability, I pushed caffeine aside, reaching, rather, for meditation. I grazed along my gopher trenched lawn to a smooth space illuminated by the sun. I perched myself upon the scratchy warmth, crossed my legs, and closed my eyes.\n\nThese days, meditation has transformed into an elusive panacea, a recommendation from the dualistic ends of doctors and monks alike; yet, there are many who are still eluded by both the benefits and literal process of closing your eyes and breathing. According to the NIH\u2014the only statistic provided being from 2012\u2014only 8% of adults claimed to practice meditation. For me, meditation is a place of darkness where I don\u2019t have to worry about what\u2019s in front of me. The trigger of visual stimulation reminding me of my pending obligations to reality is rendered null. Meditation\u2014with my eyes closed, consciously counted breaths, and internal gaze focused between the backs of my eyebrows\u2014gives me permission to occupy my self-created space for a marginal fifteen to twenty minutes each day.\n\nAs I sat, temporarily disabling one sense, I gained another; I felt the familiar swirly wisps of anxiety smolder into my chest. I allowed it to just be. My anxiety is a wave I no longer swim against; rather, I surrender to, as it carries me to a new place of knowing. I refer to it as \u201ccreative potential\u201d now, thanks to a healing haircut I received by a chanting yogic healer in L.A.\n\nI lived in Los Angeles for almost three years and, during that time, successfully lost my mind. Cold brew was my power source, every relationship\u2014both professional and personal\u2014was fleeting, and I traded my old hand-me-downs for someone else's at Buffalo Exchange. I had moved there to \u201cbecome\u201d a writer and actor, blindly taking steps in that direction, unknowingly developing the experiential skill of discernment.\n\nWhen I first moved there, I received a few offers from talent agencies to work in the mailroom. Everyone, with seemingly steady jobs at each of my three internships at production companies, had all recommended I start at an agency, where the pedigrees of the business are groomed. During my last interview at the final agency to make me an offer, the head of the Below the Line Department asked me, \u201cWhere do you see yourself in five years?\u201d\n\nI had manicured a formulated response, which had previously granted me access into another agency\u2019s training program; a position I declined, at the recommendation of my then-current mentor, to see what other offers would emerge with time.\n\n\u201cYou know, I don\u2019t know yet. Sometimes I see myself as an agent and sometimes as a producer. But, that is why I am here: to learn and take advantage of this opportunity to work with the best.\u201d\n\nHe looked at me without any inspiring confirmation that he appreciated my diplomatic response.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit.\u201d\n\nAlarms\u2014muffled to the outside by the density of my skull\u2014sent signals of panic through my brain.\n\n\u201cNow, if you\u2019re gonna work for me, you have to be honest with me. So, I will ask you again: where do you see yourself in five years?\u201d\n\nThe curtain of white embarrassment dropped across my face. My heartbeat\u2014previously restrained by overconfidence\u2014broke free as the situation\u2019s trajectory veered off-course.\n\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d\n\nMy previous performance had been to prove that I had the negotiation skills to do what it takes. So, I ruminated on his blunt assertion to be frank.\n\n\u201cMaybe he could be that one person who really does care about what I want,\u201d but before I could slyly craft my neutrality with the illusion of truth, it escaped.\n\n\u201cI want to write and act.\u201d\n\nThere was a dramatic pause as he stared at me from behind the pointed gaze of a rigid father.\n\n\u201cThen, you will die here.\u201d\n\nHis accessible vulnerability caught me off guard as he delivered this morbid guarantee. I could feel the piercing edges of his heart snag on the remnants of a dream, the regretful reminder of his own inner call left unanswered.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t have time to do anything here beyond work. I work ten-hour days and you are supposed to be here before me and leave after I do.\u201d\n\nHis words exponentially faded as I consulted my own conscience.\n\n\u201cWhat is happening? Why had every mentor, producer, assistant, and agent suggested this as the sole route to where I wanted to go when a member of the epitomized destination was suggesting otherwise?\u201d\n\nI had never considered the alternatives. I hadn\u2019t gone to film school nor had any idea of where to begin to network and meet people while writing outside of the sacred waxed marble of designated industry property. I had always considered myself fortunate for even getting as far as I had without those shimmering prerequisites. So, why was this man\u2019s unwavering advice arousing a change of heart\u2014or mind\u2014within me?\n\nHis proposal was that of freedom; freedom from routine, the regimented, the expected. Freedom had been verified by a representative of the realm of convention as a place that truly exists. Therefore, he was highlighting the subtext of my potential marginally-compensated incarceration before I impulsively signed the dotted line: to choose what I was being told to do was to sacrifice what I actually wanted to do.\n\nAs I dropped out of meditation, I peered around at the awe-inspiring abundance of nature. Its profound green that signifies vitality made more pronounced by the light of the sun, a sun that is a delicate balance of the essential and the excessive; without it, there wouldn\u2019t be life, but, with too much, that life can be wiped away. I envisioned a NY Times article in my head and a discussion about millennials, as I forewent my tea (again), guiding me to engage my laptop. I typed \u201canxiety\u201d into the Google search bar, clicking on the \u201cNews\u201d category to browse for what I intuitively felt called to research. I scanned the first page of results when I came to Alex Williams\u2019 article from a few weeks ago, \u201cProzac Nation Is Now The United States of Xanax.\u201d It discusses that Generation Y (aka: Millennials) has been attributed with anxiety as a broad sweeping sociological condition, as opposed to an individual based psycho-emotional diagnosis. The most pronounced moment for me from this angst-inducing article was the contribution made by Kai Wright, the host of \u201cThe United States of Anxiety\u201d podcast: \u201c\u2018We\u2019ve been at war since 2003, we\u2019ve seen two recessions,\u2019 [\u2026] \u2018Just digital life alone has been a massive change. Work life has changed. Everything we consider to be normal has changed. And nobody seems to trust the people in charge to tell them where they fit into the future.\u2019\u201d\n\nAmidst Wright\u2019s macro observations, the one reoccurring concept is \u201cchange.\u201d Many articles I browsed through were concerned with how change is continually manifesting rather than the proactive steps we are taking toward a resolution. We have identified the underlying \u201cproblem\u201d\u2014that change is omnipresent\u2014right? So, then, the follow-up question remains: how do we live within the boundless possibility of change?\n\nEven prior to 2003, change was happening because change is a constant. Evolution is predicated upon change and even science is still trying to figure out how our universe came to be: \u201cThe challenge for the origin of life is then explaining how billions of atoms could come together into a state of significantly higher free energy.\u201d\n\nSo, perhaps, it is safe to say that over the last fourteen years, we have evolved at a pace beyond conception all the while major unpredictable events have occurred, reinforcing this truth that not only are we unable to predict the future, but, nor do we have control over how change manifests? That maybe these events were a part of a collective realization about the human attitude toward change to get us to look at life a different way?\n\nWhen I first met change, I was 19. The Great Recession had struck a year prior when I was still na\u00efve enough to be unaffected by the rhythms of the outer world. I danced within a fantasy bubble during my freshman year until a seismic after-shock popped my sheer safety net of ignorance. My dad was without a job and my family could no longer support my being away at school. Instead of fear or resistance, my initial response was one of adaptation. I would move home, get a job, and commute to school on my days off. However, that version of simplicity was only relevant from the optimistic point of anticipation of a future situation. Once I actually came face-to-face with my new reality\u2014that felt like it had been created upon my behalf\u2014home assumed a new meaning. My parents were empty vessels, struggling to make sense of the world just the same as me. My job came with high stakes as the front desk agent of a five-star luxury hotel, starving me of any free time to plan an escape route or even consider that as a viable option.\n\nSee, the reason I had never considered alternatives\u2014prior to my agency interview\u2014is because I had been shown that life is a formula by the generations that had come before me. Yet, in the wake of the recession, this structured idea\u2014\"hard work + education = success\u201d\u2014no longer applied. The structure upon which we, as a society, understood life disintegrated and we lacked a coherent back-up plan to replace the former failed ideology. Therefore, without any grounded guidance on how to proceed without a common system in place, we panicked.\n\nWithout money, how would one survive? Without an education, how would one get a job? Which reinforced the former fear, since without a job, one wouldn\u2019t have any money.\n\nAround this time, my anxiety inflated as an orange life-preserver clutching snug around my waist as I scaled monstrous waves fueled by this collective fear. Change was everywhere; I had forfeited the quintessential college experience for a broken family; the once fluid comfort between my mom and dad had transformed into a restrained hostility that was invisible, yet corrosive. I hemorrhaged tears between work and family dinners within the darkness of my room. This all-encompassing force had seemed to be the direct cause of my unhappiness\u2014anxiety, my shield, and depression, my shadow\u2014and I didn\u2019t know how to find a solution. No one was showing me what to do or suggesting ways to cope with this accidental version of hell.\n\nCurrently, one of the people closest to me is grappling with crippling anxiety; the obsessive kind where one concocts hypotheticals in their head and observes as the psyche wrestles with each worst-case scenario that pops into the ring. All I want to do is help them by offering them the enlightening tactics that I\u2019ve discovered for myself. However, due to their demanding job that requires the totality of their faculties, while simultaneously trying to negotiate time for brief inhalations above their flood of anxiety, they have yet to implement any strategies in a consistent fashion. Rather, this person returns home, burdened by these thoughts, exasperating over their inevitable return, and their manipulation over the way this person navigates through life.\n\nWhat is one of the tactics I suggested?\n\nDuring my initial bout at 19, I also had associated anxiety with a negative experience because of its physical distress; the more I resisted it, the worse it got. Without anyone to turn to, money to see a therapist, or the invention of Instagram to find inspiring quotes, I journaled. I wrote to myself every night, even when I was dog dead tired, because I found that through the materialization of my emotions and thoughts onto paper, they made more sense. My anxiety was a previously misunderstood catalyst; its physical sensation had been asking me to pay attention to what was happening around me and, in turn, how I felt about it. By looking at my feelings outside of myself, like words in a book, I could objectively see what needed to change and draw connections, based upon evidence in my own life, for myself.\n\nThrough this unwavering engagement with what my body was telling me, I was gradually rewarded with personal revelations. I eventually realized that my anxiety stemmed from this idea of life as a formula not being the truth of reality. Leading me to the second step of learning to live with change and anxiety: addressing the misalignments between the reality of the situation and my previously held beliefs about it. I had been shown that life did not happen according to a plan; first, at age 19 and, again, at 23. So, if I couldn\u2019t control that change, I had to find something I could control instead: my belief system. By writing down new principles that resonated with me, instead of the ones I had been taught to accept as truth, I was choosing to embrace the inevitability of change, rather than resist the nature of its existence.\n\nOver time, my engagement with introspection has evolved into a personal exploration for the answer to \u201chow to live.\u201d Which, I\u2019ve determined is the point of life: to constantly be searching for that answer. Through this lifelong search, I no longer consider my life to be an externally determined constant, but, rather a work in progress. I am steadily constructing an internal house of meaning, determining how I see life for myself, based upon my constant reflection on what my experiences have taught me. Life doesn\u2019t have to be defined by struggle via a traumatic event or a self-limiting diagnosis. Rather, it can be a stream of liberating lessons through which we create our own understanding of life as it happens; self-knowledge serves as the cement, experience as the bricks, and the acceptance of change as the ground upon which the foundation rests and expands.", "url": "https://www.thriveglobal.com/stories/11122-the-antidote-to-anxiety", "summary": "I finished my chores before settling down for a cup of tea; I can\u2019t drink coffee anymore\u2014yep, anxiety.\nAs I sat, temporarily disabling one sense, I gained another; I felt the familiar swirly wisps of anxiety smolder into my chest.\nMy anxiety is a wave I no longer swim against; rather, I surrender to, as it carries me to a new place of knowing.\nI typed \u201canxiety\u201d into the Google search bar, clicking on the \u201cNews\u201d category to browse for what I intuitively felt called to research.\nI eventually realized that my anxiety stemmed from this idea of life as a formula not being the truth of reality.", "timescraped": 1513925403.849536, "category": {"words": 2312, "personal": 114, "thirdperson": 20, "condition": 7, "recovery": 0}}, "7fb8cf9f2b0f95218da8f3e8bf8d1bbc": {"title": "When Mom Was Diagnosed With Cancer, My Anxiety Took A Break", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/skinner-production/stories/featured_images/000/010/633/large/MomDickFerrantes.jpg?1500102760", "text": "Mom was diagnosed with Lung Cancer in June of 2013. The news was devastating and I remember thinking- how am I going to help her and my step dad get through this? I digress, the photo above was taken 1.5 months into mom's chemotherapy. She was on a high dose of steroids and I swear, she had more energy than all of us combined; which included myself and my 4 siblings. Mom hated smiling for photos but after she was diagnosed, she smiled without prompting. We would tease her and say, \"you're like a hummingbird on crack!\" It was so good to see my mom handling the chemotherapy so well and enjoying life. She was so ill prior to her diagnosis, we thought we were losing her then.\n\nWhen the doctor gave us her diagnosis, I cried and cried. I could not believe such a vibrant woman was facing grave circumstances. In hindsight, I think my entire family, including myself went into a phase of denial after her diagnosis. After all, she was high energy and and was always up to the next adventure. Mom spent the entire summer going on outings with one of us (her children), having parties at the house which was a norm during the summers and she would say, \"hey don't worry about me, I'm going through all of this to live, I don't plan on dying.\" We wouldn't bring up death but I'm fairly certain mom knew our fears better than we did. Mom's are fairly perceptive and protective of their children's fears.\n\nFast forward- mom began receiving radiation to her brain because her lung cancer had spread to the brain as well. Once she began radiation, our beautiful, little hummingbird on crack became more like a turtle. The steroids they had mom on worked wonderfully until the radiation. Reality was beginning to set back in again.\n\nMy father died from cancer when I was 10 years old. I remember thinking as I grew older that I was glad I had no idea he was dying and I didn't have to watch him take his last breath as my mom did. He died at home under the care of a Doctor and my mom.\n\nWhen I realized mom was declining one of my first thoughts was, I can't watch my mom die. I can't be present during the last stage of her life or I may have a panic attack and I didn't want my illness to be evident during her cancer. Mom's health and well-being were at the top of my list. I had so many fears that my anxiety would increase as she waned and that I would be unable to be there for her. I'm not sure where I drew strength from but I was able to spend more time with my mom than I usually spent with her prior to the diagnosis of cancer.\n\nI believe that focusing on mom along with the closeness that my siblings and I developed helped to stay centered. We were always a close family thanks to my mom but we became that much closer after mom's diagnosis. We respected my mom's wishes and shared our fears with one another. Mom never wanted to talk about her cancer, she would say, \"Hey it could be worse.\" She was always a strong woman but her strength really shined after she became ill. I don't remember mom ever complaining. I do remember thinking in the back of my mind that I still would not be able to handle watching her pass when that time came.\n\nMom was diagnosed with late stage small cell lung cancer in June of 2013. We were warned that most people don't live longer than 6 months with treatment after the diagnosis. Mom went on to live almost 3 years, she was a fighter. She was told not to go into the basement to do laundry about 2 years after her diagnosis because she was becoming so weak. She shared with me one day that she devised a system so she could still do her laundry- mom tied a rope to her clothes basket and would pull it up the stairs so she could fold the clothes. I think her determination to not stop 'living' kept her ALIVE longer! Mom called all the shots until the end and I want to believe this also kept her dignity intact along with extending her life. We all respected her wishes even when we thought, \"Mom needs to slow down, she's burning herself out.\"\n\nI lived over 2 hours away but made sure to stop in about every 4 weeks and spend a few days when I did get into town. My last trip to mom's house while she was alive was in January of 2016. While I was in town (and I made plans to be there for an extended period of time), mom went into a Semi-Coma 2 days before she passed. She was unable to swallow, when she did awaken, she was confused and distressed. Mom became bedridden in November of 2015 because she broke her shoulder from a simple fall.\n\nOnce mom was bedridden I knew she wasn't going to recover. My anxiety began to creep up and I thought, no- I can't be there to watch her pass. Well someone had other plans for me and a few other siblings in my family who felt the same. The day after mom went into a semi-coma she woke up and kept saying, \"I don't know what happened yesterday but I feel so good today.\" She sure did feel good, she drank 40 ounces of fluids, was able to swallow, talk, laugh and eat! The day before when mom was in a semi-coma she was telling me that she saw people. I asked her if they were still here on earth? She told me no. Her eyes looked frantic and I wasn't sure if she was seeing people that scared her so I asked if they were nice people? Mom said yes, and then I asked if she saw dad... mom became upset and said, \"NO, NO... I don't wan't to talk about it!\" I worked in a hospital for years and I remember thinking after her 'surge' that it was always a sign the person would be passing soon. Everything was happening so fast, I had no time for my anxiety to kick in which was a good thing.\n\nThe morning after mom's surge I got a call ( I was staying at a friends home not far from my mom). It was my sister and she said, \" I think you might want to get over here fast, mom took a turn for the worst and her breathing became a struggle this morning so I had to give her morphine.\" Again, no anxiety, just typical anxiety anyone would feel when facing loss. I was there within a half hour.\n\nWe all stood by mom's bed caressing her as she struggled to breathe. I told her my brother (her son) would be there very soon and her breathing became rapid as if she was holding on. My brother arrived within 10 minutes or less after I told her and had a few minutes alone with her to say what he needed, as did we all. After he shared his private thoughts, we all gathered and around mom to caress and hold her like a child. I finally told her we would be okay and so would dad. We also said, \"It's okay to let go mom, we will all be OKAY.\" I ran to a bedroom because I began to cry. Within a minute or so after I left the bedside my siblings came running in crying so hard they seemed unable to breathe.\n\nFor many, myself included, we can go into shock after the loss of a loved one. I ran back out to the living room where mom was lying and asked the hospice nurse if mom had died? She told me yes, hugged me and said she was so sorry.\" I just remember saying, I need to get back to my sisters and brother.\n\nI didn't see my mom take her last breath, did she know I wouldn't be able to handle that? I will never know but I'm glad I was there with the rest of my family to help guide her home. I'm glad she knew before she passed that we would get through this together and always stay close. I'm glad she was aware that my step dad would continue to be a vital part of our lives. They say the hearing is the last thing to go when a person is dying, I have to believe that's true after whispering that my brother was on his way and her breathing increased until be arrived. I believe with every fiber in my body that mom wanted us all with her when she passed on.\n\nI was elated that my anxiety, for what ever reasons, took a back seat during my mom's Illness and I was able to function. I have no regrets. The only regret- I wish she would have never became terminally ill but that's not a choice any of us are given in life.\n\nMom died on January 13th, 2016- my anxiety disease decided to rear it's ugly head about 4 months later. I'm still working on it. I'm grateful that it wasn't present during mom's life and passing. I think holding it in opened up a can of worms. Loss affects each of us differently. I went through certain stages of grief but there were a few my 'mind' missed. Grief can bring up a lot of baggage from the past if it wasn't dealt with.

Most days, there seems to be something that makes me feel not-so-great. Nothing life-threatening or too deeply dire, just lots of mostly minor maladies here and there that add up to an overall sense of suckiness. Headaches, weird muscle aches, earaches, toothaches, overall body aches\u2026it\u2019s getting pretty tiring, both physically and mentally. And if I do have a few good days where everything seems in pretty good working order, they are inevitably then followed by about a week of bad days where I feel crappy\u2026and then the cycle repeats itself.\n\nI know no one likes to be sick or feel bad, and I realize there are many people out there that are dealing with a LOT worse than me, but the fact remains that when I don\u2019t feel good, I seem to just\u2026shut down. Or wind myself up. Or both at the same time. For me, being sick or hurt presents a mental roadblock that is pretty tough for me to push aside.\n\nYou see, I have a history of some pretty impressive health anxiety.\n\nIt used to be a lot worse than it is now, and I worked hard to bring it under manageable control with the help of a life-saving therapist \u2014 but I continue to grapple with it and have come to accept that it will probably always be a part of who I am and something I have to work to overcome.\n\nFor someone with health anxiety, the whys and whens and hows and what-ifs threaten to overwhelm a person when they get sick or hurt, or have any \u201cunusual\u201d symptoms: Why is this happening to me, what\u2019s the exact, specific, pinpointed cause? (Because if I know the cause, I can then hopefully prevent it from happening again.) How and when did I catch this cold, or get this headache, or become short of breath? What if this headache is really the beginning of meningitis? What if this weird muscle spasm in my armpit is a sign that I have clogged heart arteries? What if those recurring cramps in my legs are because of life-threatening blood clots?\n\nWhen we can\u2019t get answers to these questions (which is most of the time), it just makes our anxiety worse, which then leads to more stress, which then causes even more health problems.\n\nStopping that fatalistic self-talk as it begins, and trying to not immediately imagine the worst possible scenario, is part of what I learned and practiced through therapy, back when the anxiety was at its worst. I was also not allowed to look up any of my symptoms on the internet, so as to not induce even more panic and feed the medical monster. I was banned from taking my pulse more than once/day or at times other than during exercise. Ultimately, I decided I had to quit my job as a health counselor where I talked about horrible health problems all day every day (the worst possible environment for me) and take myself out of that personal mine field.\n\nFor the most part, I still am able to enlist those calming strategies and avoid the full-blown panic attacks and vicious worry cycles that I used to incur on a pretty frequent basis. I remember my therapist\u2019s teachings: to tell myself what the most likely and unlikely scenarios are, and then to logically handle the symptom and situation from there. To realize that everyone \u2014 especially as we get older \u2014 has aches and pains as the normal part of life. To also realize that life doesn\u2019t always come with an explanation pamphlet for each scenario we encounter, and to learn to live with not always knowing why (as maddening as it may be). I\u2019m happy to say that I\u2019m no longer such a frequent flier at the doctor\u2019s office, but I also still believe in timely visits for those issues that truly do warrant it and not ignoring what could be serious.\n\nHealth anxiety quietly hovers in the corner of the dark room that you usually try to keep closed off, but then sneaks out every once in a while when you least expect or want it.\n\nPeople tease you about it, or avoid talking to you about any health topic whatsoever, in fear that you\u2019ll just have some kind of fit-like meltdown. (This just makes us feel worse by the way, when we\u2019re working so hard to improve.) I am kind of a worrier by nature anyway, something else that was in the genes and a trait which I just have to accept. Which means that, even when I am able to not panic out loud about an illness or strange symptom, I still quietly and subtly worry about it (for both me and for things happening to those closest to me).\n\nAnd I admit that even that subdued level of worry is still enough to cause me to focus on the issue more than I should. I find myself making more mental room for it and sacrificing attention to other things on my to-do list that get waylaid by the worry. Every once in a while, I allow myself to guiltily look up a new symptom online, and then usually regret it as soon as I see all the uninformed prattle on the chat boards. I lose my appetite when I worry too much about what\u2019s going on with my physical failings, but maybe that\u2019s normal? Being \u201cnormal\u201d and feeling \u201cgood\u201d are what I wish for every day, so I guess I feel let down and anxious when the opposite happens.\n\nAs mentioned above, I also know that worrying about my health \u2014 or anything really \u2014 actually contributes to a negative circle of physiological health effects in and of itself. Not too long ago, I had a spectacular tension headache across the back of my head that lasted for a tight and burning 48 hours; nothing would make it go away but time, but what was most frustrating for me (in terms of figuring out why it was happening) was that I\u2019d been feeling what I thought was relatively tension-free lately! I had a job that I really enjoyed, and my overt stress levels compared to past bad times were practically nil. But no one can ever be totally stress or worry-free, that\u2019s unrealistic. Even minor stress levels over things like money, or the future, or family issues, can apparently cause your cranium to feel like it\u2019s being clobbered by the Hulk.\n\nSo\u2026it\u2019s a work in progress, this tempering of my teetering.\n\nI guess that because I don\u2019t really know anyone else in my immediate circle who\u2019s dealing with this, I feel alone in my anxiety journey most of the time, and I don\u2019t usually like to talk about it; but I wanted to shed a little light on it today because I know I\u2019m actually not alone, and I know MANY others out there are also struggling to get a handle on it too. It can get better, so hang in there. Get help if you need it. If you can, figure out the source and root cause of where this anxiety is coming from, as that\u2019s how you\u2019ll be able to start dealing with it. I\u2019ve been lucky to have a few friends and family and therapists help me through it in the past, but it\u2019s a constant effort that I have to work at mostly just by myself. Like Pam from \u2018The Office\u2019 said, \u201cPobody\u2019s Nerfect.\u201d Definitely not me\u2026and I don\u2019t want to be perfect anymore anyway (or nerfect).\n\nBonne sant\u00e9!", "url": "https://journal.thriveglobal.com/hulk-headaches-health-anxiety-548e3e8206d7", "summary": "Yes Health Anxiety is a Real Thing \u2014 And You\u2019re Not Alone!\nYou see, I have a history of some pretty impressive health anxiety.\nWhen we can\u2019t get answers to these questions (which is most of the time), it just makes our anxiety worse, which then leads to more stress, which then causes even more health problems.\nHealth anxiety quietly hovers in the corner of the dark room that you usually try to keep closed off, but then sneaks out every once in a while when you least expect or want it.\n(This just makes us feel worse by the way, when we\u2019re working so hard to improve.)", "timescraped": 1513925409.019594, "category": {"words": 1289, "personal": 66, "thirdperson": 2, "condition": 9, "recovery": 0}}, "8f35f03733699503ff0c3d5769af9a7e": {"title": "How to be a beacon of calm amid stress", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/skinner-production/stories/display_images/000/017/842/large/alfred-leung-332441.jpg?1512679594", "text": "\"One of the best lessons you can learn in life is to master how to remain calm.\" Catherine Pulsifer\n\nA sense of angst is pervasive in the world right now, and in the face of it many feel powerless. People are distressed by the bad news they hear everyday\u2014 natural disasters, terrorist attacks, crime, war, plane crashes, famines, random mass shootings; human rights violations. This constant exposure to suffering and harm via 24-hour news cycles seeps through car radios, TV screens, and web browsers, and is overlaid on the routine challenges of life\u2014work demands; commitments of home and family life; health issues to be attended; financial pressures to be sorted.\n\nAs a psychologist, I hear how the despairing outlook of my clients is shaped by media exposure. One man was so anxious about the state of the world that he was seriously hesitant about wanting to proceed with his wife\u2019s pregnancy. Indeed, it\u2019s not just our perceptions that are affected by this news exposure but also our mental health.\n\nNonetheless, the general angst in our society stretches into all corners of our lives. Teachers tell me that in the past decade one of the growing challenges of their job concerns \u201canxious parents.\u201d They say it is routine for them to be faced with up to 20 parents wanting to see them before school to discuss their child or give an update, and again at the other end of the day a similar horde awaits.\n\nOften it is only to tell the teacher their child did not sleep well the night before, or did not have a good breakfast, or something else seemingly minor. Unfortunately, the queue of parents before and after class only perpetuates a sense of unease, as it can stress teachers already feeling overloaded. (Their list of duties has grown over time to include more extracurricular activities and internal reports, data collection, email, and managing extreme behaviour). Stressed teachers make for a stressed school environment and you know what comes next \u2026 how does this affect the kids?\n\nWhich leads me to the central point of this article. We are all responsible for the level of calmness within the community. We can all play a role in either raising or lowering the level by how we conduct ourselves and interact. It involves an awareness of how our actions might affect others, being mindful of any flow-on effects. As if our actions stress even one person, the ripples extend far wider involving more people who interact with that person and intersecting with stress from other areas of life (including exposure to distressing news broadcasts). You can see how the level of angst in our society compounds and spirals to create a more pervasive atmosphere.\n\nIt also involves starting with our self in generating calmness. It was Marianne Williamson who said,\n\n\u201cEverything we do is infused with the energy with which we do it. If we\u2019re frantic, life will be frantic. If we\u2019re peaceful, life will be peaceful.\u201d\n\nHence, the rest of this article outlines 10 pathways for becoming a generator of calmness. Remember the benefits lie not only in making us more productive and feeling better, but it will also help to build an atmosphere of calmness in our world.\n\n1. Slow down\n\nMake a conscious effort to slow down everything you do. Try this for even one day and see how different you feel. Talk slower, walk slower, eat slower, and breathe slower. When you slow down you become more mindful of the moment so you can be more fully present. You notice your environment more so you engage more with your surroundings and spend less time in your head. It frees you from that conscious chatter in your mind, providing a balance between internal stimulation (endless cycle of thoughts) and external stimulation (what\u2019s happening around you). When you eat slower you also taste your food more, noting different flavours and textures. When you breathe slower, taking deep breaths, you immediately feel much calmer. Let this more measured approach be a soft balm that soothes and sweetens your soul.\n\n2. Take a break\n\nResearch shows that taking a lunch break actually makes us more productive. It\u2019s even better if you can take this break away from the office. Better still, is a short respite in nature, for example, eating lunch in a garden or public park, on a bench seat in a grove of trees or a shady courtyard. There is nothing like nature to calm us, and as a highly urbanised society we\u2019re too disengaged from that process. We need those interludes of stillness from nature to calm our being. Eckhart Tolle says, \u201cLook at a tree, a flower, a plant. Let your awareness rest upon it. How still they are, how deeply rooted in being. Allow nature to teach you stillness.\u201d When you return to work after such an interlude, you cannot help but generate calmness to those around you.\n\nOn a macro level, taking a vacation is vital and will do wonders for maintaining a level of calmness in how you see the world and respond to it. Vacations also provide another opportunity to reacquaint with nature and tune in to its vibes of stillness. Getting away to the beach or mountains, a beautiful lake or forest, is deeply calming.\n\n3. Do head-clearing transitions\n\nThis is a strategy I learnt from Brendon Burchard. When switching from one task to another, first stop and empty your mind. Spend 30-60 seconds doing this, saying in your mind, \u201crelease, release, release.\u201d Focus on that releasing action, and breathe slowly. Allow your brain to change gear in a calm way, rather than jolting it into a different activity or phase of your day. Even before getting out of a car, spend those extra 30-60 seconds preparing yourself for the next stage of your schedule. Do this activity also between consulting with different clients to allow your brain to clear out and prepare for the next one so that you can be calmly focussed. This approach is being respectful of your brain and the many demands we make on it in one day.\n\n4. Do one thing at a time\n\nResearch in neuroscience shows that multi-tasking is stressful for our brain. Sure, we can do it, but it comes at a cost to our levels of calmness and wellbeing. We are not wired to cram so much into one day to the point where we are frantically juggling many tasks simultaneously. We are working against the grain if we try. People sometimes say that they have no choice at work in this respect. However, when they look a bit closer they can see that some of the pressure to multi-task comes from within them. This is the bit that you can work on. Be honest with yourself and look for those times when you can finish one task before even attempting to look at another. Be firm with yourself here, and see the vast difference it makes to how calm you feel.\n\n5. Be consistent with self-care\n\nWhen people get stressed and anxious, paradoxically there is a tendency to neglect self-care as a way of saving time and energy. Unfortunately, this approach only adds to the pressure and we end up getting less done and feeling anything but calm. Making self-care a priority is a top strategy for generating calmness within us and around us. Self-care includes making sure you get enough sleep, eating healthily with plenty of whole plant food, and getting regular physical activity. It also includes attending to any health issues by engaging health professionals. (In particular, if your gut is not functioning properly you\u2019ll probably struggle to feel calm overall. Gut flora is emerging as a significant player in regulating our mood, behaviour, and cognitive function. The adult human body has one kilogram of gut microbes, which is around the weight of our brain. To feel calm and happy, we need to keep these microbes calm and happy! So see a health practitioner to assist with any gut issues.)\n\nIt\u2019s vital also to schedule regular timeout in your diary as a way of making an appointment with yourself that needs to be honoured. A personal favourite is scheduling a monthly back massage with a trained massage therapist as a maintenance measure. Don\u2019t underestimate the power of these self-care strategies to strengthen your calm.\n\n6. Respond don\u2019t react\n\nMost people are reactive. Something provokes them and they fire with whatever comes to mind. Yet the old proverb says, \u201cDo not learn how to react. Learn how to respond.\u201d This means allowing a gap between stimulus and response. So take a deep breath. Say you want time to think things over. Allow a text/ voicemail message that provokes a strong reaction in you to sit for a while before responding (unless it\u2019s urgent of course! Most times it\u2019s not). You\u2019re much more likely to respond calmly 24 hours later. This strategy allows a space to process raw feelings and it promotes a response that is more centred and reflective rather than impulsive. Remember most times you don\u2019t need to provide an answer straight way to incoming stimulus. The raw contents of your mind, uncensored and unfiltered, could only add fuel to fire. Responding rather than reacting takes practice, but is it well worth the effort.\n\n7. Stay present\n\n\u201cAnxiety happens when you think you have to figure everything out all at once. Breathe... You\u2019re strong. Take it day by day.\u201d Salmansohn\n\nA sense of overwhelm at times robs us of calmness. In this situation, often the best thing is to not think; not try to work everything out all at once. Just stay focused on today and perhaps this week, and don\u2019t look any further ahead especially if the future is uncertain. Staying in the present moment means escorting your thoughts back to now when your mind wanders to the past or present. Research shows the more time your mind spends in the present moment the calmer you will feel. You can ground yourself in the present moment by engaging with your surroundings, and focusing on the world through your senses (rather than your thoughts). A personal favourite is sitting on a beach and focusing on the sound of waves and the sun's warmth on my skin. This exercise keeps you in the present moment and is like a brain massage!\n\n8. Be kind\n\nKindness is to calmness what love is to caring. You can\u2019t have one without the other. So spend time every day being kind, and you will spend time in calmness. Pamper your pet, shout a friend a coffee; reach out to a loved one who is lonely. Don\u2019t forget to show some kindness towards yourself too, through activities that nurture you.\n\nAnd those that anger you? What can you do about those individuals who push your buttons? Try to remember that each of us is a soul that is underdeveloped or damaged in some way. Deep down, most of us want our soul to be whole and healed, even if that is not always apparent to others. So think twice about judging others harshly as they are on the same quest as all of us. If you consider your enemies this way, you cannot help but feel kinder towards them, and thus more peaceful.\n\nAlso, if you're feeling disengaged lately from someone you care about, rather than taking it personally (an ego approach), ask yourself, what is happening for that person right now? Are they okay? This kinder approach can only strengthen relations and fuel a greater understanding, thereby promoting peace and togetherness.\n\nRemember, showing kindness is one of the most calming things you can ever do.\n\n9. Protect your Peace Bubble\n\nImagine you have a Peace Bubble enveloping your whole body. Your number one task each day is to protect it from threats. So as you go about your day, be mindful whenever your Peace Bubble is at risk. You can gauge the level of risk but how you feel. When your Peace Bubble is under threat you will feel uncomfortable and will often note your body tensing. Your immediate response must be to protect your Peace Bubble. This may involve disengaging from a conversation; taking a deep breath; refusing to be baited into conflict; or simply walking away.\n\nYou must come to see your Peace Bubble as the most important thing you have because everything else in your life depends on it remaining intact. When your Peace Bubble is safe, you can maintain a level of calmness so that you focus on the things that matter to you. Less of your time and energy is spent on destabilising input.\n\n10. Limit exposure to news broadcasts.\n\nA ten-year-old boy once asked me why grownups always turn up the news on the car radio. This is actually an astute observation about our obsession with news. In reality, however, perhaps we should be doing the very opposite a good deal of the time: for our mental health we should be turning down the news. The final strategy here therefore is to limit exposure to news broadcasts as the toxic effects are insidious. Do we really need to know details of all the grim events several times a day?\n\n\"The calmest person in the room is always the most powerful.\" Eben Pagan\n\nA calmer world\n\nPractising calmness helps us feel and perform much better. It also helps to generate more calmness in the world, and we definitely need more of that.\n\nCall to action\n\nIf you want to focus on the right activities for becoming 10x calmer, and see the positive shift in your life from doing so, check out my calmness checklist.\n\nOne last thing\u2026if you liked this article click the clapping hands icon below so others can read and enjoy it here on Medium too.

I can\u2019t even remember what triggered me, but they both looked terrified, and it was their little faces in that moment that gave me the push to finally acknowledge what was happening to me and make changes.\n\nFor the previous 18 months I\u2019d been resisting the idea I was suffering from anxiety, but I didn\u2019t recognise the person I\u2019d become. I was continuously tearful, my senses were constantly on high alert, which was in itself exhausting. I wasn\u2019t sleeping, was relying on a glass of wine at night to calm my nerves, then coffee in the morning to waken me up. I took passing comments too much to heart and worried about what other people were thinking. To the point I hid away. I didn\u2019t want to see anyone, friends or family.\n\nToday\u2026\n\n\u2026 it\u2019s a different story, but like most people on this path, I\u2019ve taken the long road to get to where I am.\n\nAnyone who has truly delved deep into their psyche and soul, will know how draining it is. But I was determined to serve my clients deeply, and I firmly believe you can only go as deep with your clients as you\u2019ve gone with yourself, so I\u2019ve spent the last 2 1/2 years on a journey of self-development and spiritual growth, not to mention retraining as a coach and NLP practitioner.\n\nYou see, I feel things extremely deeply as my husband will attest to. I not only feel my own emotions, which at times can be as deep as the ocean, but I also have this ability to tap into others emotions too\u2026 and before I learnt how to manage this ability, it drained the life out of me. Literally.\n\nHeightened senses\n\nIt took me a long time to discover what this was. That I was an empath, or highly sensitive person, and that we are, in fact, wired differently to everyone else. Our central nervous system is set up in such a way that makes us more acutely aware of, and attuned to ourselves, other people, and our environment. This realisation has been a huge turning point in my life.\n\nApproximately 1 in 5 people are highly sensitive, between 15% and 20% of the world\u2019s population. That\u2019s a lot of us out there. But not many of us realise that this is what we are. And being an empath isn\u2019t just for introverted souls, 1 in 5 empaths are in fact extroverts.\n\nToo much\u2026\n\nEmpaths are often accused of being overly emotional, too sensitive, we feel \u2018different\u2019 but often can\u2019t put their finger on why. We may feel as if there\u2019s something wrong with us, that we are a bit weak and pathetic because we are so in touch with their emotions.\n\nWe are easily over stimulated by what\u2019s going on around us (in terms of noise, lights, TV, etc) then feel a strong need to withdraw and recalibrate.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just our own emotions we\u2019re in touch with. It\u2019s other peoples too. And this is where problems occur.\n\nHere\u2019s why\n\nEmpathic fatigue, or resonance, is an extreme form of empathy. It\u2019s where an individual finds it difficult to strike the right balance between empathy and objectivity, often leading to anxiety, exhaustion, anger, and a variety of other symptoms. When this is repeated over a long period of time, it can lead to empathic distress, anxiety and emotional exhaustion.\n\nWe often feel particularly drained when we have spent too much time in the company of others, or have spent time with people who drain our energy rather than lift us up. As a result, we often need quite a lot of down time in order to recharge and recalibrate.\n\nWhat to do about it\n\nThese periods of reflection and recharge are extremely beneficial as it allows us to process all the emotions and feelings we have experienced during the day, and trust me there are plenty!\n\nHaving frequent down time reduces our anxiety and means we don\u2019t suffer the emotional exhaustion that is so common amongst empaths as it gives our central nervous system a chance to relax. This is especially important in order to calm our overactive minds at night, when they are easily stimulated as we are extremely prone to insomnia.\n\nTop Three Tips\n\nIf I were to give my three top tips to managing life as an empath:\n\nLearn how to control your thoughts in order to reduce negative emotions and beliefs. This is an extremely important process for an empath to master. Practising meditation is a surefire way to empty your mind and slow your body down. Listen to, and respect your body. Our bodies are amazing at communicating their needs to us if we are willing to listen. Tune into your body regularly; it\u2019s constantly giving you feedback. Get plenty sleep. It\u2019s when we are in the deep restorative sleep that our cortisol levels are replenished and in turn our stress levels reduce. If you\u2019re not getting enough, or quality sleep, then you will wake up feeling groggy. This is especially true if you are suffering from another common affliction of empaths, adrenal fatigue.\n\nHope\n\nAs for me, my life looks a whole lot different than it did this time last year, and my mindset has completely changed. I am a work in progress, but my experience with anxiety drives me to help others through it too.\n\nI don\u2019t believe that anxiety is something that ever goes away, but it is definitely something that diminishes over time. Reaching out for help from an external source, such as a coach, can really help you take steps forward a lot quicker than if you were to do it yourself.

And that we can learn to think differently?\u201d\n\nExample \u2013 Appropriate Thinking\n\nI offer this example. About five years ago my husband and I were in a car crash. It was as we were driving home from a week away on business. It was quite terrifying as we realized there was no way to avoid the other car which turned across our lane, apparently without the driver seeing us.\n\nWe were both fortunate that while injured, our injuries were not too serious. But our car was totaled. The people in the other car experienced shock, but no injuries.\n\nAfter the accident, the road was closed, the police and ambulance arrived, our car was towed away and the police took us to a local rental car location where we promptly hired a car and drove the rest of the way home. While we took it slowly, and stopped several times, the immediate effect of the crash was not to make us avoid traveling by car. We just wanted to get home by the most practical means available \u2013 driving.\n\nAs we all know though, the adrenaline rush after an accident can buoy us along. It can mask injuries, dull pain, sharpen our wits, and generally help us to keep functioning rather than curl up in a ball on the side of the road! But when reality hits, and we see how serious the situation really is, that changes right? We reassess and develop heightened anxiety?\n\nWell, my husband and I both spent about two weeks at home recovering from various minor injuries. During that time neither of us could really drive. We did think about the accident \u2013 and talk about it a lot! \u2013 but we focused on how well my husband had minimized the damage, how the car had protected us as it was designed to do, and how grateful we were that things were not worse. After a couple of weeks, we packed our stuff into a rental car and drove back to where we were working. Neither of us contemplated not taking the car. We were both a little hesitant when we reached that same intersection \u2013 the local police had told us that it is a place where accidents are more frequent \u2013 but after our initial wariness (which translated into greater care and attention) we really did not give it much more thought.\n\nAbout 100 people die in road accidents each day in the US. 1.3 million people die in road crashes each year worldwide. Realistically, travel by car is more dangerous than flying. And yet fear of flying is pretty common! (For an interesting look at flying stats, conditioned thinking and modern piloting methods see Chapter 7 of the book Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell.)\n\nDespite the reality of the statistics, neither I nor my husband stopped traveling by car, stopped driving, or cut down on the number of road trips we made. We did not replace our totaled car with a tank, or even a large truck. The slight risk that we face each time we drive was something we put aside and got on with life. We also believed that more times than not, we will have enough control over the situation to be able to avoid the worst car driving outcomes. One day we may be wrong, but we are not going to live life based on that unlikely outcome.\n\nAnxiety vs Incentive\n\nPart of the reason for this is that without a car we probably would not be able to live where we live in Massachusetts. We need to be able to drive if we are to see family and friends. We need to get to appointments with doctors and dentists, and we both need to be able to work.\n\nI know that at the time of the accident I made a conscious effort not to generalize that specific experience, not to use that one event as evidence that I should never go in a car again. Even as I projected forward, I visualized future rides being fine. If my mind swirled, I cut off at the earliest stages any thought that one accident might lead to another. I focused on other things, and above all maintained a healthy belief that while another accident is possible, it is unlikely. My belief is that if it happens again, I will deal with the consequences \u2013 whatever they may be.\n\nThis is an example of how preventing anxiety or a phobia came from appropriate thinking.\n\nAlternative Outcomes\n\nWhat about the other end of the spectrum, when we take an unlikely event and make it the center of all our thinking. We reinforce our anxiety about the focus of our fear every day. Confirmatory evidence receives weight and attention and we ignore contradictory evidence. This is known as confirmation bias. We scan the news for details of accidents, and don\u2019t notice that all the miles of travel without incident don\u2019t show up in the news!\n\nInstead of imagining that future drives will be fine, imagine if I had started focusing on all the ways a drive could go wrong:\n\nThe driver of our car or another car could lose consciousness\n\nThe brakes could fail\n\nAnother driver may be texting, eating or screaming at the kids in the back of their car\n\nI could fall asleep at the wheel\n\nSomeone could tamper with my car\n\nThe engine could catch fire (only a real concern if you are still driving a Ford Pinto!)\n\nAnother vehicle could cross into my lane out of control\n\nI could go on building this list all day.\n\nMy Experience of Inappropriate Thinking\n\nIn the case of the car crash, I maintained a healthy belief that the future did not hold a series of life-threatening crashes in store. But not all my experiences have led to this outcome. As a young person, I developed a phobia. I became terrified of me and others being sick. Actually, that is too passive. I created a phobia. In therapy, we searched for the \u201ctrigger\u201d \u2013 the traumatic event that \u201cmade\u201d me phobic. We explored various theories, and maybe one of them was the correct one. Maybe it was a combination. But I did not have such exceptional childhood experiences. I did not have a serious illness that caused prolonged periods of vomiting. In fact, I was hardly ever sick in any way!\n\nOther people with my experiences do not develop a phobia, but, in all likelihood, other people with my thinking about my experiences will develop anxiety, a phobia or depression.\n\nSome people will say \u201cyour problem is genetics,\u201d or that I have a \u201cpre-disposition to anxiety\u201d. But then you would think every potentially anxiety creating event would have made me anxious. For example, although bitten by a dog, I never developed a fear of dogs. I believed I had probably provoked the dog and knew that I would be more careful in future. But someone else being bitten by the dog could have turned that into a phobia by their thinking.\n\nIf I have a genetic or psychological pre-disposition then why am I not now phobic \u2013 or at least anxious \u2013 about driving in cars? And how did my emetophobia, social anxiety, and fear of the dentist all go away? If I have a genetic pre-disposition, how was it that I was emetophobic and had social anxiety but was not claustrophobic (like my Mum) or agoraphobic? Nor did I suffer depression, or a host of other mental afflictions that family members suffered.\n\nWhen I say it is faulty thinking, I am not saying it is my fault. It is likely that although my parents were not emetophobic, they may have inadvertently increased my focus on the fear of vomiting. They did that by joining in when I would ask them if I looked pale, feverish, or otherwise sickly. My parents probably did it by checking the sell by dates rather than teaching me the \u201csniff, taste, eat\u201d test. As caring parents, they did it in a host of ways that were not intentional but were powerful.\n\nPerspective \u2013 Adjust or Struggle\n\nConsider also the time factor. The reality is that for most people a bout of sickness feels crappy for a couple of hours. If they are unlucky a couple of days. Most of us can stand even the most unpleasant things for a couple of days. But when we are children, two days seems like forever.\n\nWere you ever bullied at school and longed for the weekend to be safe at home? If you experienced bullying on Wednesday then the weekend seemed a lifetime away.\n\nI have always contended that we create a sense of time based on the lifespan we have experienced so far. When you are 5, three months to Christmas is a significant amount of time compared with the time that you can remember. But when you are fifty-five, three months to Christmas seems like no time to get ready! (See my post on perspective.)\n\nIt is similar when we are ill. If you get sick on Thursday and you will be better by Saturday, that is not so bad. But as a child that is a lifetime. If at that time, we start catastrophizing the experience and start thinking of it as something that will not end, but will last forever, then it is terrifying. If, as we get older, we don\u2019t retrain our thinking and learn to evaluate the experience with an adult\u2019s perspective, we continue to be afraid now of something that we learned to fear when much younger, even though the reality of it has changed.\n\nMaybe our limited attention spans and hunger for instant gratification and relief are also factors. But these are all learned behaviors too, and they can be unlearned.\n\nSo yes, I do believe that phobias, anxiety, and depression are thinking errors. And, however hopeless we are and helpless we feel, I believe we can learn to change our thinking and build new habits. It takes willpower, practice and effective training! I did it, you can too!\n\nOriginally published at www.alle2thrive.com\n\n", "url": "https://www.thriveglobal.com/stories/12617-my-anxiety-is-caused-by-my-thinking", "summary": "A question that clients often ask me is: \u201cYou really believe phobias, anxiety, and depression come from inappropriate thinking?\nWe also believed that more times than not, we will have enough control over the situation to be able to avoid the worst car driving outcomes.\nThis is an example of how preventing anxiety or a phobia came from appropriate thinking.\nOther people with my experiences do not develop a phobia, but, in all likelihood, other people with my thinking about my experiences will develop anxiety, a phobia or depression.\nSo yes, I do believe that phobias, anxiety, and depression are thinking errors.", "timescraped": 1513925381.8949351, "category": {"words": 1672, "personal": 114, "thirdperson": 10, "condition": 8, "recovery": 1}}, "9c5ed6b8dc632da46355446ce4634465": {"title": "How Technology Can Help Decrease Your Anxiety \u2013 Thrive Global", "image": "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*nq_UkIKXaUim-5xyWQIKUQ.jpeg", "text": "How to Use Technology to Decrease Your Anxiety\n\nLeverage wearables, gadgets, and apps to raise your consciousness and learn new coping strategies.\n\nFranz12/Shutterstock.com\n\nUntil recently, I hid the fact that I struggle with anxiety. I am a happiness researcher, so I tried to stick to the facts about increasing happiness, regardless of the obstacles in our path. But the truth is that I meet people like myself everyday who struggle with reconciling competing emotions: excitement, nerves, fear, worry\u2026 In fact, one in every five Americans suffers from anxiety, and women are twice as likely to suffer as men. The cause for this dichotomy is complex \u2014 a mixture of brain chemistry, hormones and coping mechanisms \u2014 but the effects are quite simple: anxiety holds us back from reaching our full potential. But I\u2019ve learned through my work and research that this doesn\u2019t have to be the end of the story.\n\nSelf-Knowledge is Power\n\nIn ancient Greece, philosophers believed so strongly that self-knowledge was the key to human potential that they inscribed the phrase \u201cKnow Thyself\u201d onto the sacred Temple of Apollo. Since that time, philosophers, religious leaders, and authors alike have mused about the nature of humanity and our sense of self. What are humans made of? How do humans experience pain? What are emotions and why do we have them? Until recently, most of the conclusions that were drawn came from external observation or speculation. However, thanks to technology, we now have the ability to connect our external and internal worlds in ways that Socrates or Plato couldn\u2019t have imagined.\n\nWe have evolved from using kitschy mood rings to reveal our emotional state to having real tech to understand what\u2019s going on inside our bodies on an intellectual, emotional, and even molecular level. We are witnessing a new era in which people can actually get a personal, real-time snapshot inside their bodies. With MRIs, we have literally been able to peer into the brain to see how stimuli like stress affect decision-making, which then triggers other physiological responses like increased heart rate, sweat, and headaches.\n\nNow, it\u2019s worth noting that you probably expected this article to focus on the need to unplug from your devices to escape notification overload and reduce anxiety in your life. Don\u2019t worry, that article is coming soon. However, in the meantime, I want to start this conversation about processing and reducing anxiety in a different place: using technology to help us tune in to our bodies and minds to provide unprecedented insight into behavior change.\n\nJust as science has helped athletes to hone their bodies and minds to reach more of their potential, so we can adopt the same rigor and discipline to developing our minds, from a neuron level to an entire system level, to rethink stress and anxiety. Self-knowledge is power, and technology can help you understand yourself on a deeper level and then use that information to fuel your growth.\n\nGetting My Skin in the Game\n\nAt GoodThink, we often say that research is useless unless it is lived, so I decided to personally test out the growing field of wearables designed to increase my consciousness and raise my well-being. In the course of my research, I wound up testing over 400 emerging apps and gadgets. I\u2019ve been shocked by posture trainers, pricked by blood testers, and had my skin ripped off by Velcro adhesive. I literally got my skin in the game. But I\u2019ve also discovered some amazing wearables that I know will change the way we understand our minds and bodies in the years to come. One of my favorite wearables, called the Spire Stone, is a small lava-shaped rock with a clip that attaches to your waistband or bra strap; it uses your breathing patterns to determine if you are feeling calm or focused or tense. As a naturally anxious person, I found this feedback loop useful; however, about five days into my trial period with the Spire, this device went from fascinating to fundamentally transformative.\n\nThrough an unfortunate series of circumstances, my eight-year old daughter Ana broke her neck last summer in our backyard pool. Fortunately, she is fine now and doing back handsprings all over the house; but at the time, I remember driving Ana to the hospital to get X-rays while wearing my Spire stone, and it surprisingly said that I was feeling quite calm \u2026 It wasn\u2019t until we were walking out of the hospital, with Ana in a giant neck brace, that the Spire stone began to vibrate, indicating that I was feeling tense. And I thought, yeah I know!! My daughter just broke her neck. But the vibration caused me to pause and think about why I was feeling tense, and I realized\u2026 \u201cI was worried about what other people would think about me, as the mom of a child with a broken neck\u2026rather than being present with Ana, supporting her as she wrestled with her new reality \u2014 a summer of no gymnastics, no lacrosse, no swimming. This 30-second feedback loop from the Spire Stone was just enough to help me re-frame my thoughts and mindfully pivot to be more of the mother I wanted to be.\n\nUsing Technology to Create Behavior Change\n\nThis is technology at its finest \u2014 helping to raise our consciousness and to fuel well-being through science-backed solutions. And there are so many emerging technologies coming onto the market that will help us to gain insight into living happier, healthier lives: from the Muse (a brain-sensing headband that provides real-time feedback to develop your meditation practice) to Psious (a Virtual Reality solution to help treat phobias and anxiety disorders). If you are one of the millions of Americans who also struggles with anxiety, I encourage you to explore the plethora of emerging technologies designed to help you dial down and tune into your own body. In my book The Future of Happiness, I detail over one hundred different gadgets and apps designed to help you track your cortisol levels, breathing, brain activity, fitness, water consumption, and more. But before you run off and start downloading a slew of new apps, here\u2019s my recommendation to you:\n\n1. First, study your triggers. Is your anxiety related to travel, food, schedules, lack of time, or something else?\n\n2. Research wearables and apps specific to your triggers. If you feel anxious because of the number of to do items on your list, try the Evernote app to write worries down in a \u201cparking lot\u201d where you won\u2019t forget important to dos; if you feel like you are always on the go, try an app like Simple Habit to develop a practice of meditation in the midst of the busy-ness of life (during a commute, on a walk, in the midst of work).\n\n3. Pick one (and only one) wearable or app to try. While it\u2019s tempting to use the fire-hose solution to a problem, you may actually create more anxiety by trying to juggle multiple devices and apps at the same time.\n\n4. Last, stick with your intervention for at least 21 days. Make a good faith effort to try your new intervention for at least three weeks to solidify behavior change. If you fall off the horse, just get back on and try again.\n\nAnxiety is not something that can be solved overnight; but we can learn to respond better and to even preempt triggers that cause anxiety in your life. There\u2019s no time like the present to set up a better future.\n\nDisclosure: I was given a review copy of the Spire Stone, but my opinions are my own.", "url": "https://journal.thriveglobal.com/how-technology-can-help-decrease-your-anxiety-ae0aa99ab9d5", "summary": "How to Use Technology to Decrease Your AnxietyLeverage wearables, gadgets, and apps to raise your consciousness and learn new coping strategies.\nSelf-knowledge is power, and technology can help you understand yourself on a deeper level and then use that information to fuel your growth.\nUsing Technology to Create Behavior ChangeThis is technology at its finest \u2014 helping to raise our consciousness and to fuel well-being through science-backed solutions.\nAnxiety is not something that can be solved overnight; but we can learn to respond better and to even preempt triggers that cause anxiety in your life.\nDisclosure: I was given a review copy of the Spire Stone, but my opinions are my own.", "timescraped": 1513925386.481903, "category": {"words": 1251, "personal": 47, "thirdperson": 10, "condition": 9, "recovery": 0}}, "902ecf01b06682b999c349bd6429af7a": {"title": "Chrissy Teigen Reveals Her Struggle With Postpartum Depression", "image": "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*WL2X9OaNf3IxApsxZy3yog.png", "text": "Chrissy Teigen Reveals Her Struggle With Postpartum Depression\n\nThe model and cookbook author is sharing her story and helping end the stigma around maternal mental health.\n\nOne in nine women suffers from postpartum depression, according to the CDC, and Chrissy Teigen wants the world to know she\u2019s one of them.\n\nTeigen opened up about her diagnosis in an essay for Glamour.

However, according to Dr. Marla Deibler, these individuals should avoid limiting themselves.\n\nDeibler, a licensed clinical psychologist and the executive director of The Center for Emotional Health of Greater Philadelphia, notes that avoidance is a major factor in maintaining anxiety.\n\n\"Thus, those who struggle with anxiety should strive to fully participate in life, despite their bodily experience of anxiety \u2014 anywhere at anytime,\" Deibler says. \"Being willing to fully experience themselves and their private experiences (thoughts, feelings, physical sensations, etc.) and being accepting of that range of experiences while continuing to act on with what is important to them will lead them to in the direction of ceasing the struggle with anxiety.\"\n\nDeibler provided Business Insider with some crucial tips \u2014 from symptom management strategies to changing your entire mindset \u2014 for handling anxiety in the workplace.\n\n1. Don't suppress your anxiety\n\nStifling your feelings is counterproductive.\n\n\"Everyone experiences anxiety,\" Deibler says. \"It is a normal response to stress. Let it in when it shows up. Practice acceptance. Rather than trying to push it away (which tends to be futile, resulting in feeling more overwhelmed and less in control), make room for anxiety. It is showing up to try to bring your attention to something.\"\n\nDeibler says that, by allowing space for some anxiety at work, you'll render it less bothersome in the long run.\n\n2. Be mindful\n\nCheck in with yourself once in a while.\n\n\"Examine anxiety with curiosity when it shows up, rather than rejecting it,\" says Deibler. \"What do you notice when it shows up? What are you thinking and feeling?\"\n\n3. Invite anxiety along for the ride\n\nConfront your anxieties head on. If you're nervous about public speaking, take point on a presentation. If you're afraid of talking to your coworkers, try to strike up a conversation.\n\n\"Push yourself to enter situations that lead to anxiety in order to demonstrate to yourself that you can persevere and succeed despite anxiety,\" Deibler says. \"Exposing yourself to anxiety provoking situations, rather than avoiding them, helps to change your relationship to anxiety and increase your confidence in these situations.\"\n\n4. Practice self-care\n\nDon't forget to take care of yourself.\n\n\"Attend to your own feelings and healthy lifestyle practices: good nutrition, sleep, and exercise are important to well-being, resilience, and healthy stress management,\" Deibler says.\n\n5. Remind yourself that your mind is not always the best advisor\n\nSometimes, you can't trust yourself.\n\n\"Our minds like to constantly tell stories, analyze, judge, give advice, and criticize,\" Deibler says. \"Sometimes these thoughts are supremely unhelpful to us. Observe what your mind does. Notice the thoughts. Note that they are not objective truths. You get to decide whether the thoughts are worthy of your attention.\"\n\n6. Take a break\n\nDeibler notes that changing your pace or scenery from time to time actually helps with managing anxiety.\n\n7. Stay connected\n\nYou can get by with a little help from your friends.\n\n\"Social support is vital to managing stress,\" says Deibler. \"Maintain connections to family and friends. Talking with others can do a world of good.\"\n\n8. Relax\n\nEngage in exercises that relax your body and set your mind at ease.\n\n\"Diaphragmatic breathing or other relaxation inducing practice (e.g., mindfulness meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, guided imagery exercises, tai chi, yoga) can reduce stress by helping to encourage the relaxation response.\"\n\n9.

An indescribable shape shifter that shows up unannounced and almost always overstays its welcome. Shared by many, anxiety affects roughly 18 percent of the population - approximately 40 million Americans over the age of 18 (National Institute of Mental Health). These figures are likely higher as they exclude adults who do not seek treatment or people who are not aware that they even have anxiety. I was an example of the latter up until this past year.\n\nAlthough I displayed symptoms from early adolescence, I never thought I had anxiety. I assumed my frantic mind, racing heart, and feelings of dread were a product of normal levels of stress. Truthfully, I did not accept anxiety\u2019s hold on me until it had wrecked havoc on my physical health and I had no choice but to make a change.\n\nSince then, I have developed the following strategies to gain an understanding of my anxiety and how I can better manage it.\n\nI quit fighting and started riding.\n\nFor me, anxiety is like the river - go with the flow and I can ride it out, try to stand in its way and I get toppled over. Before, I would try to ignore the physical and mental signs, pretending they did not exist until my emotions became completely debilitating. Now, I acknowledge or even state to myself or partner \u201cI am anxious right now, but I will be ok\u201d. I take a breath and allow myself to feel it, rather than try and will it to disappear. When I do so, my anxiety loosens its grip enough to help me refocus my energy and find some peace.\n\nI share my story.\n\nThe most therapeutic thing I ever did was speak openly about my anxiety. First, to my partner and family and then to my friends. Recently, I took this a step further and spoke about my struggle in a TEDx Talk. The positive responses from both strangers and friends were empowering. A condition that had felt isolating became a way to connect with people around me on a deeper level. It was inspiring to see how people began sharing their own anxiety stories because I shared mine. When we are vulnerable, open and honest about our struggles, we can destigmatize mental health disorders and encourage others to speak up. On a larger scale, we can create a more empathetic and connected society.\n\nI stop viewing recurrent anxiety as a failure.\n\nLet's get real. Even though I have found ways to ease my anxiety, I still have panic attacks. Sometimes, all the strategies that worked before render themselves useless. Rather than feel defeated, I choose to love myself even harder and embrace anxiety as a part of my story. It is in my power to move forward and remain motivated by the progress I have made so far, on both a small or large scale.\n\nDespite the issues I have had with anxiety, I would not change who I am. We must all remember that we are, in our own way, brilliant, complex and most importantly human. I choose to view this challenge as a lifelong opportunity for growth and as a result, I have found a deeper strength and confidence in myself to live a happy and fulfilling life.", "url": "https://www.thriveglobal.com/stories/14513-so-what-are-you-anxious-about", "summary": "Shared by many, anxiety affects roughly 18 percent of the population - approximately 40 million Americans over the age of 18 (National Institute of Mental Health).\nTruthfully, I did not accept anxiety\u2019s hold on me until it had wrecked havoc on my physical health and I had no choice but to make a change.\nBefore, I would try to ignore the physical and mental signs, pretending they did not exist until my emotions became completely debilitating.\nNow, I acknowledge or even state to myself or partner \u201cI am anxious right now, but I will be ok\u201d.\nWhen we are vulnerable, open and honest about our struggles, we can destigmatize mental health disorders and encourage others to speak up.", "timescraped": 1513925393.062824, "category": {"words": 539, "personal": 38, "thirdperson": 4, "condition": 11, "recovery": 0}}, "18c8146ed2eb569fed34baf234b391c2": {"title": "The Link Between Gut Health and Stress \u2013 Thrive Global", "image": "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*sorPqn4rZSCIuwPUhwosRw.jpeg", "text": "The Link Between Gut Health and Stress\n\nHere\u2019s how to fortify your gut and keep stress from taking over your life.\n\nDeposit Photos via pressmaster\n\nStress.\n\nIt\u2019s a struggle for all of us at one time or another, but did you know that recurrent stress \u2014 the heightened sense of urgency, anxiety, fear, or even adrenaline that is often present in our fast-paced, modern lives \u2014 can literally chip away at the foundation of your health and affect your long-term wellness?\n\nJust thinking about all of life\u2019s obligations and to-do lists can leave your stomach in knots \u2014 and for good reason. The burden of too much stress directly affects your most recently discovered \u201corgan\u201d: your microbiome.\n\nResearch shows that ongoing stress can negatively affect the trillions of healthy bacteria in your gut, and subpar gut health can have a depressing effect on your entire system.\n\nThe good news is that understanding how to support your friendly microbes as you do your best to manage your day-to-day stress levels can help you experience healthier and more fulfilling days.\n\nFirst Thing\u2019s First: Get to Know Your Gut\n\nAs the epicenter of your body, your gut is home to trillions of microbes that all work in harmony with your body\u2019s cells to keep you thriving.\n\nIn fact, 80% of your immune system lives within the inner ecosystem of the gut, affecting almost every aspect of how you feel each day.\n\nWhen your gut is healthy, it contains a solid balance of about 85% good guys and 15% bad guys.\n\nThe good bacteria in your body work to keep you both feeling and functioning at your best by:\n\nSupporting your immune system\n\nDigesting your food\n\nSupporting mental clarity\n\nPromoting nutrient absorption\n\nBalancing your hormones\n\nNormalizing glucose levels\n\nSupporting a healthy gut barrier\n\nRegulating inflammation\n\nWarding off pathogens and disease-causing microbes\n\nHowever, many aspects of everyday life can deplete your good bacteria without you even knowing, like highly processed food, antibiotics (both as medicine and in our food supply), everyday hygiene habits, toxins in the environment, the natural aging process, and as we\u2019ve mentioned above, ongoing stress.\n\nHow Stress Hurts Your Gut and Your Health\n\nPut simply, when you\u2019re experiencing elevated stress levels, your brain goes into flight-or-fight mode, which can impact the blood flow to your gut. This is why it\u2019s common to experience a lull in digestive and immune health in tandem with episodes of heightened stress.\n\nInterestingly, one of the key services your bacteria provide is helping to signal the proper response to the brain to cope with elevated \u201cstressors\u201d so that they don\u2019t affect the rest of the body.\n\nBut when compounded over time, chronic, long-term stress can erode the good guys put in place to protect you from the effects of\u2026you guessed it, stress.\n\nLooking deeper, the Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology published a recent study showing that consistent stress negatively affects the amount and diversity of your good gut flora.\n\nAnd, when it comes to gut health, diverse and plentiful are the goal. Otherwise, your whole ecosystem suffers, which can affect the way you look, feel, and even how you act.\n\nRecent studies have even suggested that a microbiome influenced by stress can lead to the type of inflammation that is tied to mental health issues such as depression or anxiety.\n\nTo add insult to injury, the harmful effects of the stress response can weaken your gut\u2019s intestinal lining against invaders \u2014 making you more susceptible to illness, exhaustion, and nutritional deficiencies.\n\nYou see, your \u201cgut barrier\u201d keeps unfriendly microbes and pathogens from entering your bloodstream.\n\nWhen your good microbes are weakened or damaged due to stress, the integrity of your gut lining can become compromised and this could manifest in a plethora of health issues.\n\nFortunately for us, stress is manageable and the microbiome is malleable \u2014 meaning that if we can take daily action to improve our microbial health while we work to reduce our stress levels, we might be able to find the right answers to living, looking, and feeling our best.\n\nImprove Your Gut Health, Optimize Your Stress Response\n\nWhen comprised of abundant numbers of well-nourished beneficial bacteria, your microbiome helps to optimize the body\u2019s response to stress, and also keeps stress\u2019 negative effects on your overall health in check.\n\nSo, how do your friendly gut flora keep stress in line?\n\nFor one, your gut bacteria produce important mood-regulating neurotransmitters like serotonin (the \u201chappiness\u201d chemical) that communicate with the brain and are key when it comes to coping with mental turmoil.\n\nOther healthy bacteria in the gut work to help lower cortisol, the notorious \u201cstress\u201d hormone. In one study, medical students preparing for an important test drank probiotic-rich fermented milk or placebo for eight weeks prior to the exam.\n\nStudents given the fermented milk showed lower cortisol levels, increased serotonin levels, and fewer GI symptoms typically associated with stress and anxiety than students in the control group.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, human studies show that consuming prebiotics (the indigestible fibers that feed probiotics so they can thrive) also increases the amount of neurotransmitters that affect stress levels.\n\nIn other words, both supplementing with good gut bacteria and making sure they are well fed helps mitigate stress and its negative effects on your system.\n\nHere are some of the best ways to support your friendly microbes and prioritize your long-term health and wellness:\n\nDeposit Photos, copyright name: Kerdkanno\n\nOptimize your diet.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to make poor dietary choices when you\u2019re overwhelmed or running on empty, but that\u2019s all the more reason to focus on giving your body nourishing foods that fuel the foundation of your health.\n\nBecause your microbiome changes relatively quickly based on the foods you eat, it\u2019s important to aim for a diet high in whole and plant-based foods with an emphasis on prebiotic fiber. Prebiotics are to probiotics what fertilizer is to a garden \u2014 they are specific fibers found in many foods that nourish our healthy bacteria and help them thrive.\n\nTake a daily probiotic supplement.\n\nAn effective probiotic, taken consistently, can replenish your populations of good bacteria. Make sure you choose one that provides several different targeted strains of bacteria that can survive your harsh stomach acid to reach deep within the GI tract where they can make their home and get to work for you.\n\nMake movement a priority.\n\nThe research is clear; microbiomes are healthier and more diverse in those who are physically active. And it has to be said that one of the of the best ways to decompress from a stressful day is to exercise. Even walking 30 minutes a day can help melt the stress and it makes a real difference when it comes to your microbial health!\n\nGet plenty of sleep.\n\nNot only does quality, plentiful sleep help reduce stress and keep you feeling your best physically and emotionally, but research shows that it benefits your gut bacteria as well. In fact, any disruption to your innate circadian rhythms (from lack of sleep or jet lag, for example) can throw off the rhythms of your gut microbes, leading to a depleted microbiome.\n\nDo your best to get a solid 7\u20139 hours of sleep every night \u2014 making sleep a priority will pay you back in dividends when it comes to long-term health and vitality.\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid of a little dirt.\n\nStudies show that contrary to our approach over the last century, we actually benefit from exposure to dirt and bacteria. The microbes from the soil train our immune system to work properly. So, get outside and garden, play with the dog, or go camping for a healthy dose of dirty fun.\n\nAnd when you\u2019re done, opt to clean up with water and natural soap, rather than antibacterial products that indiscriminately wipe out all your good bacteria.\n\nSay no to antibiotics whenever possible.\n\nAntibiotics in our food and as medicine are detrimental to our colonies of good bacteria: they wipe out the good guys along with the bad. Do your best to avoid meat, fish and dairy products that may contain antibiotics and check with your doctor to make sure antibiotics are indeed necessary before taking them.\n\nFind ways to simplify, shift your perspective, relax, and enjoy more.\n\nPutting first things first and taking care of yourself is top priority.\n\nWhether it\u2019s saying no more often, becoming a minimalist, heading to a meditation retreat, or simply taking the time to appreciate, laugh, and savor the now with the people you love most, finding ways to support your mental and emotional health is paramount to both living life congruent with your desires and to optimizing your gut and overall health.\n\nThough sometimes it seems the norm in today\u2019s world is to feel continually stressed, disconnected, tired, and frazzled, we must remember that we are the authors of our own lives and we can make the conscious decision to slow down and find our balance.\n\nAnd I can tell you from personal experience, that it\u2019s better to make this decision proactively than to wait for health issues that force a reevaluation.\n\nOccasional stress is inevitable, and it can even help you define and navigate your path on the way to a healthy, fulfilling life. Fortunately, as you journey through all of life\u2019s ups and downs, you can choose to prioritize your health, well-being, and happiness by living in harmony with your microbes and making decisions that support your entire being, inside and out.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

In 1985, 18 percent of respondents agreed with a statement saying they \u201cfelt overwhelmed\u201d by all they had to do the previous year. In 2010, that number climbed to 29 percent. Then, in 2016, it shot up to 41 percent.\n\nIn a recent New York Times\u2019 Magazine cover story, Benoit Denizet-Lewis uses this and other stats to argue that teens in America today are more worried than those that came before. Here\u2019s another data point to add to the evidence: Over the last decade, anxiety eclipsed depression as the most common reason college students seek counseling services.\n\nDenizet-Lewis\u2019s reporting points to a generational difference at play: Life is different for today\u2019s teens compared to those who grew up before them. And while there are certainly multiple causes, as is the case with any complex, large-scale psychological trend, the influence of social media is now undeniable.\n\nSan Diego State University psychologist Jean Twenge, author of Generation Me (about millennials) and iGen (about Gen Z), says that it took her a minute to arrive at that conclusion. Social media \u201cseemed like too easy an explanation for negative mental-health outcomes in teens, and there wasn\u2019t much evidence for it,\u201d she tells Denizet-Lewis. But other explanations\u2014including the economy\u2014just didn\u2019t shake out. Teen anxiety started spiking in 2011, after the recession was already turning around.\n\nSocial platforms like Instagram and Snapchat ensure there\u2019s never a break from the social pressures of high school. \u201cMany of the parents I spoke to worried that their kids\u2019 digital habits \u2014 round-the-clock responding to texts, posting to social media, obsessively following the filtered exploits of peers \u2014 were partly to blame for their children\u2019s struggles,\u201d Denizet-Lewis writes. The trope used to be that teens would spend way too much time talking into the telephone; now they're keeping up Snapstreaks.\n\nAs Thrive Global has reported before, teen self-harm and suicide both go up during the school year, and decrease in the summer months. Social media has exacerbated the already complicated lives of teens, who are, at a neural level, more sensitive to social approval\u2014both in-person and in likes\u2014than adults.\n\nGuy Diamond, PhD, who directs Drexel University\u2019s Family Intervention Science program for depressed, substance-abusing or suicidal adolescents, says that social media has allowed social pressures and bullying to \u201cscale,\u201d in the parlance of Silicon Valley. \u201cWith social media, the personal becomes the public in a way that a lot of kids don't know how to handle it,\u201d he tells Thrive Global. \u201cEven bullying used to be more of an isolated act.

Most will call it, \u2019depression\u2019. It occasionally shows up, just once in awhile, and then leaves, unexpectedly. Especially when I am able to do something and catch it off guard. Other times, it feels like a can of molten lead that pours all over my being, blocking the experience of pleasure, beauty and love. The lead hardens and sometimes feels like it coats all of my pores and keeps me from feeling anything, but it\u2019s suffocating toxic fumes. It feels like a shield which gets so stiff, so tight that I cannot move. I feel immobilized.\n\nAs an intuitive empath, often times it shows up as a result of feeling the energies of other people and the world at large. At other times, it takes up residence in my body as the uninvited guest who came for dinner and never left. Yet there has always been a constant flicker of hope, especially when I remember to shift into action with my breath and body, from a hike in nature, the smell of a fragrant flower, and most of all, YOGA. (And especially breath work with Kundalini Yoga)\n\nEven when I feel as if I want to stay home and hide under the covers, it seems the only other place I feel safe is my yoga class. In fact, yesterday, I was especially sad and fearful, while chatting with a friend before my yoga class, and told her I wanted to go back home. This wise young lady said, go to your yoga class, get the body moving and the breath deep, you will feel better. To my surprise and relief, the resistance melted away and by the time we started the first Asana (pose) I was out of the pain and into the breath and movement.\n\nIt is amazing how this practice has become my saving grace. With all the chaos and evils of the world being tossed at us in all forms of communication, the simple act of shutting off the tech and getting into nature, or a yoga class can do wonders for the soul.\n\n\u201cThese are the times that try men\u2019s souls.\u201d Thomas Paine\n\nOne word comes to mind, Weltschmerz, as defined by \u2018sadness or melancholy at the evils of the world; world-weariness,\u2019 Collins English Dictionary. (Leave it to the Germans to come up with such a word). German author Jean Paul expressed it as \u201cthe kind of feeling experienced by someone who believes that physical reality can never satisfy the demands of the mind.\u201d\n\nEven Marcel Proust, whose epic autobiographical novel, Remembrance of Things Past, shares \u2018we find the longing for something only after we are separated from it\u2019. The loss of an idealized person or paradise, is palpable when we feel we have intense yearnings for a primal relationship that becomes nostalgic. If only my lover didn\u2019t leave\u2026\u2026.If only I could leave this dead end job\u2026\u2026.if only I could escape to paradise again.\n\n\u201c..that melancholy which we feel when we cease to obey orders which, from one day to another, keep the future hidden, and realize that we have at last begun to live in real earnest, as a grown-up person, the life, the only life that any of us has at his disposal.\u201d Marcel Proust\n\nIf you google the words, creative celebs with depression you will find 29,500,00 results. From Britney Spears to Catherine Zeta Jones, Carrie Fisher to Robin Williams, and dozens more are splashed across the tabloids. While Princess Diana\u2019s personal battles with depression and eating disorder were publicly displayed with little or no help from her family, most are suffering in quiet desperation.\n\nExquisite models and superstars, like Paulina Porizkova experienced this extreme state after she was voted off ABC\u2019s Dancing with the Stars in 2007. This triggered her feelings of rejection and led to anxiety attacks. An \u2018antidepressant helped dull her anxiety,\u2019 Porizkova wrote in a 2011 Huffington Post editorial, but also affected her personality. Like so many of us who have taken the \u2018blue pill\u2019, we end up stopping the medication, with a battle of withdrawal symptoms.\n\nThe only way for many is with exercise and willpower. While she\u2019s not an \u201canti-medicine crusader,\u201d Poritzkova wrote that she is \u201cstarting to wonder whether antidepressants can often be the emotional equivalent of plastic surgery.\u201d\n\nIn the movie the Matrix, Neo is forced to choose between the blue pill and the red pill. Choosing the red pill would be a quick \u2018escape from the Matrix and into the real world\u2019, the \u201dtruth of reality even though it is a harsher, more difficult life;\u2019 while the blue pill that most choose, keeps them staying in the Matrix, wearing colored lenses that can only see the illusion of a \u2018pretend comfortable world.\u2019\n\nI personally have lived my life through the eyes of an artist. However, the past several years, I have not been doing much fine art, except writing. If one has an artistic nature, it has been said that living without artistic expression, life may become out of balance. I see that now. When one is not expressing themselves in some passionate way that feeds the soul, the energy can become scattered and even neurotic.\n\nThere is a well known link between depression and creativity. That link can be found because major depression is amplified in those who tend to ruminate on their thoughts. On the upside, as author Tanner Christensen states, \u201cbeing creative is to make sense of and connect the small details of everything we experience, the good and the bad. The creative person, who spends his or her time ruminating on thoughts is likely to suffer from major depression.\u201d\n\n\u2018When we ruminate, however, our brains are naturally drawn to things that are vital to our health. Pain and suffering are such immense experiences, even if they\u2019re short-lived, that those who ruminate tend to loop through those painful experiences more often than those who don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nResearch from Andy Thomson and Paul Andrews confirms this approach, stating that \u2018depression is an evolutionary way for us to tightly focus our attention on what needs changing in our lives.\u2019\n\nHighly creative people have a tendency towards suffering via the same brain that makes them so amazingly talented.\n\nAnother upside is that many creative, romantic types (like me) also experience deeper, more satisfying pleasure, be it the gentle touch of a lover, a fragrant flower or a midsummer\u2019s night breeze at sunset.\n\nWhen coming out of a creative slump, according to Shelley Carson, an instructor on creativity and psychology at Harvard University, \u201c there is enough motivation to produce immense amounts of work. And it\u2019s a very real boost, identical to one you would get if you received a random gift or really great news.\u201d\n\nWhile many may be diagnosed as \u2018bi-polar\u2019 and end up taking pharmaceutical drugs, others are able to ride out the waves and become more productive, satisfied and create from a place of inspiration.\n\nChristensen also states, \u201cOf course, the motivational boost is often an inverse of the level of depression. So if you\u2019re in a truly deep funk and start coming out of it, you can expect your motivation to be equally as high as the low.\u201d\n\nThe most commonplace way of treatment, is pharmaceutical drugs, with a side of therapy Often times, the drugs do curb the depression and anxiety but leave much to be desired. After decades of research, the symptoms seem to be relieved in the beginning but them more and more cocktails are being prescribed because the initial boost wears off. And they can also have negative side effects like weight gain and decreased sexual desire that leads to abandoning the medication.The widespread increase in both anxiety and depression are spurring more research to find more sustainable treatments.\n\n\u201cDespite modern advances in psychopharmacology, and the development of so many integrative forms of psychotherapy, we haven\u2019t made a significant dent in this epidemic of emotional illness,\u201d says clinical psychologist and yoga teacher Bo Forbes. Parvati Shallow, CBS News\n\nAs the founder of Integrative Yoga Therapeutics, Forbes specializes in the healing arts by using yoga for \u201canxiety, insomnia, depression, immune disorders, chronic pain, and physical injuries, as well as athletic performance.\u201d Now in collaboration and research with neuroscientists Dave Vago and Norman Farb at the Mind & Life Institute, they are exploring the effect of yoga on anxiety and depression.\u201d\n\nLike the benefits of mindfulness meditation as a means of self-mastery, yoga is becoming a widespread practice for those that are seeking the mind/body/spirit connection. Instead of dealing with the twentieth century mind-therapy model, the new studies are showing that if you focus on your breath, change your body patterns the mind will follow.\n\nAdam King, an artistic soul who delves into his depression, says \u201cIt\u2019s really a simple matter of choice. If you decide you\u2019re too addicted to the emotional responses of your depressive state, then stay there. But if you\u2019re like me, and you know there\u2019s so much more to life than constant suffering, then I hope you\u2019ll take what I\u2019ve laid out here and be inspired to begin the process of owning your path to freedom Now that I was very well acquainted with depression and had taken the time to learn why it\u2019s here, I could identify the neuro-path that brought it and me together. Like retracing the steps and events that came together to slowly let it in.\n\nWith decades of research for my own depression, I agree that getting to the root cause of each episode can help. However, it seems to be a life-long journey. Perhaps the best we can hope for is to embrace the flow of feelings, find pleasurable ways to enjoy the upswing and move through the lows with dignity and grace. Working with the breath, moving the body and changing the patterns seems to help by accessing the mind-body network. (This is also why mindfulness meditation has become so popular.) So for now, yoga is my \u2018drug of choice\u2019.\n\nFor more information: see here \u201cThese studies validate what the ancient practitioners of yoga understood\u2013that yoga is a holistic approach to bringing us into a state in which body, mind and heart (all the koshas) are in balance.\u201d\n\nFor more juicy life stories, sign up for my blog at the5starlife", "url": "https://journal.thriveglobal.com/yoga-therapy-busting-the-blues-5dd843ed2f51", "summary": "Yoga-Therapy: Busting the BluesThe Golden Door Spa, YogaHere it is again, that familiar \u2018visitor\u2019 that keeps showing up on and off through the ups and downs called life.\nAt other times, it takes up residence in my body as the uninvited guest who came for dinner and never left.\nThis wise young lady said, go to your yoga class, get the body moving and the breath deep, you will feel better.\nWith decades of research for my own depression, I agree that getting to the root cause of each episode can help.\nWorking with the breath, moving the body and changing the patterns seems to help by accessing the mind-body network.", "timescraped": 1513925352.279316, "category": {"words": 1712, "personal": 41, "thirdperson": 17, "condition": 11, "recovery": 0}}, "e6b93225f105bc8ef295277cac9209a5": {"title": "Learnings from \"Turtles All The Way Down\"", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/skinner-production/stories/featured_images/000/018/185/large/stairs-and-light-barnimages.jpg?1512344561", "text": "\"Turtles All The Way Down\" is the latest book from John Green, the author responsible for the successful book and movie hit, \"The Fault In Our Starts\".\n\nJohn Green's genre is fiction for the young adults but nonetheless I was a big fan.

It was that moment where I can totally define how I feel.\n\nI chose to get out of an unhappy marriage and yet here I am. I chose to move on to another company and got a higher pay plus a number of recognitions and yet here I am. I moved to another country for six years where they say the grass is greener and yet here I am. I chose to do some traveling to cross off items from my bucket-list and yet here I am. I chose to do some travel writing and ran my own travel blog and yet here I am.\n\nAlong the way I made new friends, had a boyfriend, traveled to places where I got to eat freshly baked authentic french croissant and jambon et fromage and danced under the entrancing Northern Lights and yet here I am.\n\nWhere it's dark and deafeningly quiet. Where I am not sure if I am facing North or South or East or West. Where I cannot see anything, hear any sound and feel anything. Where I hear only the echo of my own voice. I tried to reach out for a wall or a ceiling but I cannot find one. Where I have no idea which way is forward or backward. Where there is nothing and all I have is nothingness. And yes, it's scary.\n\nWhy me? Why am I here where it's too dark? Why do I feel tired all the time? Why I am sad? What will make me live life? Why do I always find myself back at square one?\n\nWhile I know I the answers to these questions will not magically appear just yet, just throwing these questions out into the universal void makes me feel better. It relieves some pain, like how a frozen strawberry yogurt brings out a smile on my lips. It is important to note that at this point, I have better questions to work on. And that thought alone makes me look forward to acting on it.\n\nI look out the window and see that dawn is breaking. It's a new day.

The research was based on interviews of friends and family of individuals who had committed suicide. The study, published in the Journal of Personality, found that 56 percent of those who had committed suicide exhibited a \u201cperceived external pressure to be perfect.\u201d\n\nAnd this wasn\u2019t the first study to find a link between perfectionism and suicide. \u201cOver 50 years of research implicates perfectionism in suicide,\u201d the study says.\n\nMany people who strive for perfection will not commit suicide, but there are millions of perfectionists who struggle with the negative consequences of perfectionism everyday. One of those main consequences is anxiety.\n\nPerfectionism can stem from a variety of things. For some people, perfectionism starts at childhood due to pressure from parents or other factors that create feelings of anxiety. For others, perfectionism is spurred by a desire to control the world around them. For this reason, anxiety can often lead people to become perfectionists. People who feel anxiety often search for ways to alleviate that anxiety and striving for perfection or a world without stressors can seem like an ideal goal. This is also seen in people with obsessive compulsive disorder who believe perfection can produce positive outcomes. But ultimately this goal remains out of reach.\n\nPsychologists and psychiatrists have reported that a large number of the people they serve who are suffering from anxiety, are also perfectionists. Anxiety due to perfectionism can manifest itself in a variety of ways. In general, perfectionists often set unrealistic expectations for themselves. As a result, they are often hindered because they struggle to meet those expectations and this causes anxiety.\n\n\u201cThe relationship between perfectionism and anxiety is often not clear to the person who attends my consulting rooms. They typically attend because they are anxious, but often do not call it anxiety or even know they are anxious. I don\u2019t ever recall someone presenting saying they are a perfectionist and want to change that. I believe there are two main reasons for this. Firstly, high achievement is praised in our culture, and it seems logical to infer that if you aim really high, you will get a perfect or close to perfect outcome and will be praised. Secondly, perfectionists rarely recognize themselves and the potentially debilitating effects of this trait. It is usually during the course of therapy that perfectionism is identified and addressed,\u201d writes psychologist Sharryn Muir.\n\nUnfortunately people who strive for perfection often experience the opposite outcome of what they are trying to achieve. This largely has to do with the ways in which perfectionism contributes to procrastination. People striving for perfection often spend far too much time on work, projects, and other tasks because they waste time trying to make them perfect. Conversely, others who focus on completing tasks and projects often get further simply due to the fact that they complete things more quickly.\n\nIn this way perfectionism is irrational. According to a study by researchers at York University, procrastination often stems from the fear of disapproval.The study looked at 131 college-aged individuals and found a strong link between procrastination and perfectionism. The drive to be perfect often creates anxiety, and to avoid this feeling people can put off doing things, which in turn makes them feel more anxious; it\u2019s a vicious circle. This is what leads to procrastination. People put off doing the projects and tasks they want to excel at because they are afraid they will fail or they are afraid of what others will think if it\u2019s not perfect. But by putting these things off they often have trouble getting things done on time or even completing things at all.\n\nDespite the reality, perfectionists are often viewed favorably. Perfectionists, also sometimes called type-A personalities, are often the people others turn to to handle difficult tasks. That because perfectionists often emphasize the strengths of their condition without revealing the weaknesses, namely, the anxiety and procrastination that come with it. These people are often the ones others turn to to partner up with for group assignments in school and the ones people want to hire at work, but while being high-achievers, they can also be problematic. That\u2019s because, according to the research out of York University perfectionism can often hold people back from finding success at all.\n\nIn order to counteract the negative effects of perfectionism, there are several tactics people can take. These can involve seeking psychiatric or psychological help, but ultimately they begin with a single admission: no one is perfect. This is the crux of what keeps perfectionists from achieving their goals and in the case of procrastination, not being able to actually begin pursuing their goals at all. Once people admit that nothing can ever truly be perfect, they reduce their expectations and can set more achievable goals.

But clinical insomnia\u2014defined as persistent difficulty falling and staying asleep, with additional negative effects for daytime functioning\u2014affects 5 to 10 percent of adults.\n\nWe know that people with insomnia are more likely to develop a wide range of mental health problems. The risk of developing depression, for instance, doubles. It\u2019s well established that people with psychological disorders tend to sleep badly. What\u2019s less clear is why.\n\nThe conventional view among mental health professionals is that where sleep problems co-exist with other psychological difficulties, insomnia is essentially a product of them: you can\u2019t sleep because you\u2019re anxious, for example, or because your depression means that you\u2019re not physically active during the day.\n\nThat means insomnia languishes way down in the list of problems to be tackled. Indeed, there\u2019s no pressing need to deal with them. The assumption has been that when the depression lifts or the anxiety abates, sleep will automatically improve.\n\nBut now it seems that we may have been putting the horse before the cart. Insomnia may not simply be a result of psychological disorders: it may also help cause them.\n\nThis week in the Lancet Psychiatry, we report on what may be the largest randomized controlled trial of an intervention for a mental health issue. Conducted at the University of Oxford\u2019s Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute, with support from colleagues in universities across the UK and funding from the Wellcome Trust, we recruited over 3700 students with insomnia from 26 British universities. Half were assigned a course of web-based cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. (CBT is the clinically recommended first-line treatment for insomnia.) For the other participants, it was \u201cbusiness as usual,\u201d which in most cases meant minimal treatment.\n\nThe digital treatment we offered the students is called Sleepio. It\u2019s made up of six short sessions accessed on a weekly basis, though participants can take things more slowly if they like. The program is personalized, but essentially it boils down to three areas: changing behavior, altering the way we think about our sleep and sleeplessness, and also providing general guidance on what sleep is and how best to go about getting enough of it.\n\nUnder the \u201cbehavior\u201d heading participants tried techniques designed to build an association between being in bed and sleep (rather than sleeplessness). For example, if you\u2019re not sleeping after twenty minutes, you don't lie there worrying: you get up and do something relaxing instead. And you limit the amount of time you spend in bed to the number of hours sleep you\u2019re currently getting\u2014say six hours. Once you\u2019re sleeping for all or most of those six hours in bed, you can gradually build it up.\n\nDifferent cognitive strategies were used to help the participants reassess the way they viewed the business of getting to sleep. Mindful meditation was featured, for example, and so too was encouraging people to put time aside to reflect on their day before going to bed. We also asked participants to reflect upon and challenge some less helpful beliefs about sleep, like \u201cIf I don\u2019t get at least eight hours I won't be able to function,\u201d for example.\n\nWe assessed participants for six months. What we found was striking. The students assigned the CBT course reported much lower levels of insomnia. That was no surprise, but what we were really interested in were the effects on other psychological problems. And indeed the participants who received the sleep treatment were also less likely to report excessive mistrust, hallucinatory experiences, anxiety, depression, and nightmares. Their level of happiness was improved and they could function better too. Improvements in sleep were large; for the other problems we tended to see small to moderate gains.\n\nWe don't know whether our results would have been different with a more diverse set of participants, though there\u2019s no strong reason to suppose that they would. What is evident, though, is that the current view of sleep problems needs radical revision. Insomnia isn\u2019t the sole cause of complex psychological problems. But the idea that insomnia is merely a product of these other difficulties doesn\u2019t stack up. Experiencing insomnia isn\u2019t an inevitable precursor to mental health issues. Sleeping badly doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll develop depression or start hearing voices. But for many people insomnia can be part of the complex package of causes. A vicious cycle can emerge: because you\u2019re exhausted, your psychological problems feel even more intense\u2014which in turn makes it harder to get a proper night\u2019s rest.\n\nHow exactly does sleeplessness harm mental health? We can point to certain plausible mechanisms, which reinforce the idea of a causal connection. Lack of sleep can have a profound effect both on the content of our thoughts and how we process them. Thoughts are skewed to the fearful and downbeat, and processing is more likely to include repetitive loops of negative thinking, or rumination This, in turn, makes experiencing negative emotions more likely. It also seems that the kind of genetic and environmental factors that can play a part in insomnia are implicated in other psychological problems.\n\nWe need much more research into these mechanisms. Undeniably, we also need sleep problems to be taken more seriously by health professionals. After all, insomnia is almost uniquely free from stigma. It\u2019s the one psychological problem most people are happy to own up to. Treat that and you\u2019re potentially nipping in the bud a host of other issues.\n\nOn an individual level, the study is a reminder of how important quality sleep is for our mental health. Without wanting to be preachy, cutting corners on sleep is a misstep. We need to put the same value on sleep as we do on, say, sensible nutrition and regular exercise\u2014and especially if we\u2019re going through tough times. If sleep isn\u2019t happening for us for a prolonged period, it\u2019s sensible to seek help. Not only will we sleep better, we could be saving ourselves a great deal of distress further down the line.\n\nDaniel Freeman is a Professor of Clinical Psychology and NIHR Research Professor at the University of Oxford.

As a small child I had separation anxiety. I was the only child in my neighborhood who didn\u2019t go to preschool. It was difficult for me to go places by myself, or even to be home alone, especially at night. Still, somehow, I didn\u2019t realize my problem was anxiety until my son was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) when he was 14.\n\nOver the past eight years, I\u2019ve talked to specialists, sat in group therapy and read lots of self-help books and articles. Through trial and error, and lots of humility and patience (sometimes not so much), I have learned some important truths that I hope will help others who live with the daily struggle of chronic anxiety.\n\nYou can\u2019t always trust your own feelings.\n\nIn my experience, with anxiety comes a touch of paranoia, as well. If I am anxious that someone doesn\u2019t like me, then my brain will look for \u201cevidence\u201d to prove it\u2019s theory. Did my friend not call when she said she would? There\u2019s the proof. Obviously.\n\nIf my son told me exactly what I just told you, I would be the first to try to convince him that his theory is ridiculous. But somehow, when it\u2019s my own brain telling me these lies, I choose to believe them.\n\nI have found that the best way to counteract the lies my brain tells me is to defuse them. I ask someone I trust, usually my husband or therapist, if they think my \u201cevidence\u201d makes sense. If they say no, then every time that thought returns, I remind myself that it is false. Talk about it.\n\nWhether it\u2019s general anxiety, or specific anxious thoughts, labeling them and talking about them to someone else helps in two ways.\n\nFirst, it helps me to understand myself a little better. Labeling my feelings and thoughts helps me to know my triggers and to better express my needs and wants to others.\n\nSecond, talking about the thoughts and feelings, instead of keeping them secret, gives them so much less power. Alone in my head, they are all-powerful. Make self-care a priority.\n\nEstablishing a routine of self-care helps to keep me calm; makes me feel safe. My daily routine consists of devotions, journaling, exercise, healthy eating (mostly), and a calm, relaxing, consistent bed time. Overdoing it will just make the situation worse.\n\nA few years ago, I learned about The Spoon Theory, a blog post written by Christine Miserandino, as a way to answer the question of what lupus felt like. Over the years, those of us with chronic illnesses and mental illnesses have co-opted the story. The gist of the it is that having anxiety means I have limited resources compared to those with \u201cnormal\u201d brains.\n\nA lot of energy goes into dealing with anxious thoughts, so if I plan too much in a day, I will have less energy for the next day. More than four or five stops on an errand run, meeting too many new people in a day - these are the areas where it is particularly easy for me to overdo it and regret it. Getting help does not make you a failure.\n\nWhether help means taking prescription meds, or talking to a mental health professional, calling a suicide help line, or even just asking your bestie to go shopping with you, it\u2019s okay to ask for help. In fact, if you think about it, asking for help doesn\u2019t make you a failure. It makes you a success at knowing what you need and articulating it.\n\nWhat lessons have you learned from living with anxiety?", "url": "https://journal.thriveglobal.com/five-things-ive-learned-from-living-with-anxiety-4c4f2e404429", "summary": "Five Things I\u2019ve Learned From Living With AnxietyHow my anxious brain thinks.\nStill, somehow, I didn\u2019t realize my problem was anxiety until my son was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) when he was 14.\nWhether it\u2019s general anxiety, or specific anxious thoughts, labeling them and talking about them to someone else helps in two ways.\nLabeling my feelings and thoughts helps me to know my triggers and to better express my needs and wants to others.\nA lot of energy goes into dealing with anxious thoughts, so if I plan too much in a day, I will have less energy for the next day.", "timescraped": 1513925332.621461, "category": {"words": 611, "personal": 27, "thirdperson": 11, "condition": 10, "recovery": 0}}, "889da2a592682da170bccf4aa9a9ef06": {"title": "Stumbling Block- Is It Causing You to struggle? \u2013 Thrive Global", "image": "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*BBTYQCOU19-alC8D_P06GQ.jpeg", "text": "Stumbling Block- Is It Causing You To Struggle?\n\nAre the choices you make your own will or due to an unexpected change in your life?\n\nThere are several passages in the Bible that talk about not being a stumbling block to another person. I came across the verse recently in the book of Romans, \u201c\u2026rather decide to never put a stumbling block or hindrance in the way of a brother.\u201d\n\nI have known this passage for as long as I can remember. I feel like I have tried hard to apply it in my life. I never want my choices or actions in life to cause somebody to suffer. However, I never took into account if somebody became a stumbling block for me until recently.\n\nI am divorced due to my partner being unfaithful in the marriage. I remember how I felt that moment that I discovered that I was deceived throughout the span of the relationship. It felt like a truckload of bricks was dumped on my head. I remember thinking, \u201cThis cannot be reality. This cannot be my reality. How can a person destroy somebody like this?\u201d\n\nWhen it came to the point where I knew that I could no longer remain in the marriage, I told myself and believed that I was okay. I felt that I could have my new beginning and be strong.\n\nI had no clue how big that stumbling block was until a couple of weeks ago. As I reflected on my life choices since the divorce, I was completely baffled. I had become a person that I truly could not recognize.\n\nI did not have a clue during that time period that I was continuing to allow that stumbling block that my failed marriage had put in front of me to continuously cause me to fall. I was accepting advice from people whom I would have never taken advice from to justify the bad decisions I was making. I was ignoring the righteous advice of those who truly cared about me because I was scared to face myself.\n\nFor the first time in my life I have chosen to stare my reality in the face. It is so scary. I realized that I was trying to gain stability from people who did not really care about me. I was allowing people to come into my life, without being cautious.\n\nI know I was not protecting my heart at all. I wanted the quick fix. I wanted to feel the happiness and love that I have longed for, for so long.\n\nMy reality is that when the giant stumbling block obstructed my path, the choices I have made also became stumbling blocks that I created for myself. I completely ignored my faith. I made myself believe that the God I believed in for so long could not help me and that His Word was outdated.\n\nI had not been attending church regularly. One night I felt that I needed to attend a service. It was a Wednesday night. I felt that the sermon was tailored for me. I will never forget when the pastor said, \u201cGod does not just tolerate you, He purposely created you because He loves you.\u201d When he uttered those words, I can feel the tears cascade down my face.\n\nAt that moment, I can remember in the past shouting at God. Asking God why He created me. Asking God why he was allowing this hurt into my life.\n\nAlthough that night planted a seed in my heart, that was not my turning point. I left church feeling fulfilled, but as the days passed by, I continued to live my life as if that night didn\u2019t happen.\n\nI don\u2019t want to get into the details, but I will admit that I continued to live a sinful life without any regard to repentance. My mindset went back to thinking that the Word was outdated and that I was going to make my own choices. I had told myself that I followed God\u2019s way when I got married and it blew up in my face. So why would I follow Him now?\n\nIf I\u2019m honest, and I am trying to be as honest as possible, I know that I wanted the marriage to be of God, but I also knew that my partner was not completely right. He was able to provide the talk, but he did not practice in the faith. There were red flags that I chose to ignore.\n\nI knew all along that I had a void. I told myself that I was a Christian. I told myself that the void was not God. I told myself that there was something else I needed. I was allowing the world to come into my mind. I was allowing the seductiveness of sin to enter into me. I was allowing alcohol, men, bad advice, basically any distraction I can find to control me. I was deceiving myself.\n\nI finally reached the turning point. I had put my hope and stability into something that was not stable and not of God. When that failed me, I could feel myself lose control. I began to cry uncontrollably. I talked to God in a way that I believe that I have never talked to Him before. I reached for support from my mom and my sister. I admitted that I had not faced my reality. I admitted that I was living a sinful life.\n\nI went to another church service. Again it felt as though the sermon was tailored for me. I felt empowered. I rededicated my life to God.\n\nI would love to say that the story ended there and I completely am walking in confidence, but that would be a lie. Now that I have chosen to truly face my reality and trust in God, I feel better, but I am human and I continue to struggle.\n\nOn a business trip, in a lonely hotel room, I collapsed on the floor and cried uncontrollably. I was able to contact my mom during this time. My mom firmly told me to get out my Bible and read it aloud to her. I did as she said. I can feel my anxiety level go down, and I can feel my strength increase and my trust in God rise.\n\nAfter I hung up the phone, I continued to read. I came across a passage in the book of Mark where a leper comes to Jesus and says to Him, \u201cIf You are willing, You can make me clean.\u201d Jesus\u2019 response was absolutely beautiful. It stated that Jesus was moved with compassion and told him, \u201cI am willing, be cleansed.\u201d At that point I fell to the floor and worshipped. I told Jesus in my own way to cleanse me. Words fail to explain how I felt in that moment. Words like beautiful, amazing, or wonderful, cannot even capture the moment that I knew I belonged to Jesus.\n\nLater that night, I was able to attend a remote church service that broadcasted my pastor live. I knew that making the choice to rededicate my life was the best decision I have and will ever have made for myself. However, my struggle continues to be the times when I am alone, when the quiet is so loud that I feel myself falling apart.\n\nI have to say God, again, had another sermon that was tailored for me. The pastor spoke about the empty tomb and through her emotions; Mary Magdalene did not immediately recognize Jesus in front of her. The pastor talked about times in our own lives when we are shouting, \u201cWhere are you God?\u201d And God is telling us, \u201cI am right here.\u201d But we don\u2019t stop to notice because we are entrapped in our emotions, similar to Mary Magdalene when she did not initially recognize Jesus when He was right in front of her.\n\nI have shouted many times in my life, \u201cGod where are you?\u201d The truth is God has never left me. He has always been faithful to me and has never left me. I cling onto this verse from the book of John, when Jesus says, \u201cIn this world you will have trouble, but take heart, I have overcome the world.\u201d\n\nThere will be trouble in the world. Jesus said it. We have all experienced it and will continue to experience it. But if we allow Jesus to take control of our lives, He will be with us in our times of trouble.\n\nI am so thankful that I serve a God of love and forgiveness. I have chosen to return to God. As the pastor I have been listening to for over twenty years often says during alter calls, everyone that Jesus called, He called publically. I am using this blog to publically share my testimony in hopes that it will help at least one person return to their faith that they may have abandoned as I did for a period of time in my life.", "url": "https://journal.thriveglobal.com/stumbling-block-is-it-causing-you-to-struggle-2dfbb0fe1f", "summary": "Stumbling Block- Is It Causing You To Struggle?\nThere are several passages in the Bible that talk about not being a stumbling block to another person.\nHowever, I never took into account if somebody became a stumbling block for me until recently.\nI had no clue how big that stumbling block was until a couple of weeks ago.\nMy reality is that when the giant stumbling block obstructed my path, the choices I have made also became stumbling blocks that I created for myself.", "timescraped": 1513925338.144304, "category": {"words": 1480, "personal": 132, "thirdperson": 17, "condition": 1, "recovery": 0}}, "2a4a0cbf11dab7e38f4bb0418bf4d9c3": {"title": "Anxiety, I Thought You Were Leaving! \u2013 Thrive Global", "image": "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*P1m9gnlbTz9veftZhBDkVw.jpeg", "text": "Anxiety, I thought you were leaving!\n\nAn Unwelcome Visitor\n\nPhoto Courtesy of: pexels.com\n\nWhen I was six years old I had to have my tonsils removed and went in for routine blood work prior to my surgery. I never had my blood drawn before and didn\u2019t feel any fear until I saw the needle. I remember crying and then I remember telling my mom I feel sick. The next thing I remembered was waking up on a bed while as the gal in the lab offered me a cup of orange juice. I guess I became so panicked I passed out. How can a young child feel so much fear at such a young age and pass out? I don\u2019t remember her inserting the needle or seeing blood. I had a fear of blood from that day forward.\n\nI was a happy, outgoing child with a lot of fears. I even had a fear at a very young age of plugging a cord into an electric outlet, I thought I would get electrocuted. My dad always had a way of working with me to overcome my fears, he was very patient and had a sense of calm that I could feel. I trusted my dad. He calmly showed me how to plug the cord into the outlet after many protests from me, my mom was trying to convince me first but the more I cried, it would frustrate her. I picked up on her frustration, she wasn\u2019t angry, she just didn\u2019t know how to deal with my emotions. I was only 4 or 5 years old when they showed me how to properly plug a cord into the wall, how or better yet why\u2026 did I even know fear at that age?\n\nWe used to go camping a lot when I was younger and one morning dad decided to take us all for a swim, I was the only child who wasn\u2019t able to jump into the deeper water off the wooden raft. I remember dad trying to coax me as I stood there crying and telling him I was afraid I would drown. He was in the water and reassured me that he would never let me drown, he\u2019d catch me! Dad offered me a nickel (yes, that seemed like a lot of money back then) to jump in. I finally gained the courage and jumped. Dad caught me and let me go under the water while I was in his arms and then I came back up. I was so proud of myself and the fear left me.\n\nI was eight years old when I dived into the water. Two years later my father died from cancer. I had no idea dad had cancer. He was ill for almost two year before he died. He functioned well until the last four months of his life and then he became bedridden. I remember bringing dad his birthday present into his room and watching him open it with excitement. After dad opened his gift, a saw that I bought him, he said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to use this with you in the garage.\u201d I barked back, \u201cYea, if you ever get out of bed again!\u201d In my mind as child, I thought he was being lazy and had a cold for a very long time. I\u2019m sure I missed our time together. I loved being out in his workroom in the garage with him. I talked a lot and dad would listen, laugh, joke with me and again, he was so patient. My mom was so busy raising five children so her patience differed. Dad never got out of bed again and died less than a month after his 40th birthday, I was ten years old.\n\nAfter dads funeral, we rarely spoke of him again. As a matter of fact I don\u2019t think we brought up my dads name much at all until I was in my twenties.\n\nI continued to be a nervous kid and teen. I obsessed over everything, or so it felt. I worried about girls getting mad at me, I worried about my grades, I worried about my mom being pissed at me, I obsessed over boys! I wanted to be liked and didn\u2019t want anyone to get mad at me. I had two fears, losing friends and as I grew older, I feared death.\n\nI began to worry about death and dying when I was 19 years old. I was working in a hospital then as a Respiratory Technician. As a Respiratory Technician we responded to any trauma that came into our Emergency Room. I saw a lot of people die at a very young age. I remember during one particular trauma while I was ventilating the patient, I became light headed and felt as though I was going to pass out. The Doctor who was present said, \u201cYou look as white as a ghost, are you okay?\u201d I told him I was feeling sick and I needed to excuse myself. I ran to the bathroom and kept putting cold water on my face as I stood there bawling my eyes out, I was embarrassed and frustrated with myself. I remember thinking, what the hell is happening, why am I such a wimp?!!\n\nI experienced \u2018incidents\u2019 like this off and on until my early thirties. I just assumed for years that this was a norm for me, I was just a weak, wimpy person who needed to toughen up and believe me, I tried. I had my first full blown panic attack in my early thirties and I thought for sure I was dying. My heart began to race, I broke out in a sweat and I became so light headed that I went upstairs to lie down. The panic attack seemed to come on out of no-where, I was playing a video game and enjoying it. I didn\u2019t realize at the time that it was a panic attack, that was until I had another one a few days later. The panic attacks became frequent and I became depressed because again, I obsessed that I probably had something seriously wrong with me. It took me a few months or so but I finally sought help. I went to my family Doctor first, he did blood tests and asked me a ton of questions after a good physical, he finally said I was having panic attacks. I had never heard of a panic attack before and thought it was my fault\u2026 I literally thought, \u201cWhat a loser, you worry so much about everything, it\u2019s no wonder.\u201d Oh, the thoughts that go through your mind when you know you\u2019re different but can\u2019t understand why!\n\nMy friend talked me into going to a Psychiatrist (not my Doctor) and I have to admit it was extremely hard to make that appointment. This was back in the early 90\u2019s when people with Mental Health issues were considered \u2018crazy,\u2019 and well\u2026 you just didn\u2019t talk about it much to anyone. There was still such a stigma attached to Mental Health issues, the stigma was so extreme that the patient did blame themselves. Counseling wasn\u2019t very popular in the 90\u2019s and you didn\u2019t share it with others if you were going to a Psychiatrist and/or Counselor, hush was the word! I was lucky for quite some time because the medication the Psychiatrist gave me kept my panic attacks at bay until my mid to late forties. I actually thought I had over come my panic attacks until they came back with a fervor in my late forties.\n\nI began seeing a Psychiatrist on a semi-regular basis for my panic disorder and by this time I had full blown Generalized Anxiety Disorder (a topic for another blog). Again, it seemed there was a long period of time that different medication and a few lifestyle changes slowed my Anxiety down quite a bit and my panic disorder seemed to be on it\u2019s way out the door, or so I thought.\n\nI lost my mom to cancer over a year ago and within 3\u20134 months my Generalized Anxiety and Panic disorder decided to become a full time visitor. I thought it was just from grieving but I realized by Christmas of this past year that it was getting worse instead of better. I also fell into a clinical depression which is not uncommon if panic and anxiety plague your mind/body for more than a few months. As I wrote in one of my previous articles, if you have Anxiety for certain period of time it will lead to depression, the body gets tired from trying to fight the symptoms of Anxiety.\n\nSo what did I find out, I found out through therapy that my Anxiety has been with me since I was a young child. My Therapist believes it became much worse after I lost my father and there wasn\u2019t full closure. I will know more as my therapy continues and we progress with EMDR.\n\nEye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy is an integrative psychotherapy approach that has been extensively researched and proven effective for the treatment of trauma. EMDR is a set of standardized protocols that incorporates elements from many different treatment approaches.\n\nMy father\u2019s death was just the catalyst and we have a lot of work to do. I have faith that with this new therapy I will be able to overcome a lot of my past and my mind will be able to process information in a healthier manner. The idea with EMDR is that another part of your brain will take on certain memories and process them differently, which helps to alleviate many symptoms associated with Anxiety Disorder and depression. I was also told that I\u2019m suffering from PTSD and I always thought PTSD was related to one MAJOR trauma but they have found that many traumas throughout a person\u2019s life can lead to PTSD as well.\n\nThe good news, the stigma has lessened a lot and no-one should fear seeking help.

When I was in the fifth grade, for example, my life\u2019s goal was to find the cure for AIDS to save Magic Johnson. My vision of success, however, has morphed over the years, from being famous or making millions to having a meaningful impact on the lives of others. To me, the mom raising quality human beings is just as successful as the CEO of a large nonprofit. It\u2019s all about making a difference\u2014that feeling in your heart that you get when you help someone is bar none the most successful feeling I will ever have. I\u2019m hopeful that I can string together lots of these transformative moments over the course of my lifetime in order to lead a happy, healthy, worthwhile journey.\n\nI didn\u2019t always think this way, though. I used to be out for money, power, and prestige. As a result, nothing was ever enough. I was always right around the corner from happiness, just two stops away from satisfied. Success, in my mind, was an elusive moment in time that never seemed to arrive. Even today, I don\u2019t think I will ever stop striving for more. But \u201cmore\u201d used to mean something very different to me. \u201cMore\u201d used to look like a $1 million salary, an impressive job title, designer clothes, all the latest tech, the perfect man, the works. It used to mean \u201cmore than you have.\u201d I wanted to be the best; there was simply no place for losers. I was going to win at life.\n\nAll went well for quite some time. I attended Barnard College for undergrad and NYU Stern School of Business for my MBA. I found myself working at one of the most prestigious firms on Wall Street. People would have killed to be in my position, and yet\u2026I never felt fulfilled. I always came just short of having a great year. I wanted everything to be perfect, and it wasn\u2019t.\n\nThen one day, the stress got to be too much for me. I descended into my first manic episode and had to be hospitalized. I had cracked; failure appeared to be my only option. Hunter S. Thompson once wrote, \u201cthere is no honest way to explain [the edge] because the only people who really know where it is are the ones who have gone over.\u201d And he\u2019s right\u2014losing my mind to bipolar mania and psychosis meant losing my job, my friends, my sense of security, and most importantly, my sense of self. My identity as a successful 12-year Wall Street veteran was swapped for that of a mental patient relegated to her hospital bed. I had never felt so low. It took me a good two years to beat the psychosis, anxiety, and depression. I still struggle with being completely functional, but most of my days are good ones.\n\nEverything changed after I had my breakdown. I felt like I would never again come close to knowing what success fees like. Though I had not been entirely happy in my previous life, I found myself longing for those days on Wall Street, haunted by thoughts of how good I had had it. I felt as though I was now doomed to lead an ordinary existence\u2014something completely unacceptable to such an extraordinary person as myself. But as I regained my strength, the lights turned back on in my brain. I started to let in the sunshine in and dream again.\n\nDuring my recovery, I needed to believe that all the pain that I had gone through could not have been in vain. I believed that what I had experienced made me uniquely equipped to help the people I relate to most\u2014the dually diagnosed. The dually diagnosed, or \u201cdouble winners\u201d as I like to call them, are people with both mental illness and substance use disorder. Their struggle to stay sane is doubly difficult. I feel that building a business around helping this overlooked group of individuals is what I am meant to do.\n\nSo ask yourself: What does success mean to you? Are you defining it in a healthy and realistic way, or are you imposing an impossible standard on yourself? For me, success has evolved from dangerous obsession into making a difference\u2014in one person\u2019s life or the lives of many. My goal is now strategic, measured, and achievable. It is no longer a faraway dream, but my living mantra. I am already there.

Maybe I\u2019ll have a home like that one day. But for now\u2026\n\nI can tell you right now that if you were to come over, you will find dishes in the sink, jackets thrown over the sofa and cat toys everywhere. Even if I had been expecting you, my house would be in the same state. You may think I\u2019m just lazy. When you see me, you see a healthy looking 20-something stay-at-home-mama. You may even think that I\u2019m incredibly lazy because it\u2019s not as if my child is a toddler who needs constant care. My son is 12-years-old. He walks to and from school by himself. He prepares his own breakfast and heats his own lunch for school. But something you don\u2019t see\u2026? Something you don\u2019t realize is that\u2026\n\nI struggle. Every. Single. Day.\n\nYou can\u2019t tell by looking at me that I have had SEVEN diagnoses since September 2015: 1 dermatological condition, 4 spinal conditions, anxiety and clinical depression.\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t know that:\n\nI was one semester away from graduating from my Registered Massage Therapy program before I had to go on this medical leave.\n\nI have seen 6 specialists to try and find the correct diagnoses.\n\nI have a \u201clittle pharmacy\u201d in my bathroom for the collection of medications that I have to take and that I get a blood test every month to make sure that my medications aren\u2019t affecting my liver.\n\nWe\u2019ve all been there are some point \u2014 quick to judge until we realize that there are conditions that are not visible to the naked eye. Just because someone doesn\u2019t look like they\u2019re struggling or suffering, doesn\u2019t mean that they aren\u2019t.\n\nSo why is my house a mess?\n\nThe simplified version: my back hurts.\n\nThe not so simplified version: the conditions that I was diagnosed with causes me great back pain. So much back pain that I have to lay down multiple times a day to get the pressure off my spine. I was advised by my doctor to not get a job where I stand all the time. In all honesty, that advise kinda sucks. It\u2019s not as if my back only hurts if I stand for long periods. My back also hurts when I sit for too long. So pretty much,\u2026 laying down is the only pain-free position for my back.\n\nLet\u2019s go a bit in-depth, shall we?\n\nThe least worrisome of my spinal diagnoses are Degenerative Disc Disease and Scoliosis. I mean, we\u2019re all going to get DDD at some point in our lives and my degeneration is still on the mild side. I have an s-curve scoliosis \u2014 that means that it affects my entire spine.\n\nMy last two diagnoses are a bit more complicated and they\u2019re the ones that affect me the most. I was diagnosed with bilateral Spondylolysis and Spondylolisthesis.\n\nSpondylolysis is a defect in a part of your vertebrae. In my case, I have a fracture on either side of one of my vertebrae. How did it happen? Beats me! *shrugs* It\u2019s usually caused by high-impact sports. I don\u2019t do sports.\n\nis a defect in a part of your vertebrae. In my case, I have a fracture on either side of one of my vertebrae. How did it happen? Beats me! *shrugs* It\u2019s usually caused by high-impact sports. I don\u2019t do sports. Spondylolisthesis is when one of your vertebras slip forward in relation to the others. There are four grades \u2014 a grade per percentage affected (grade 1 = 0\u201325%, grade 2 = 26\u201350% etc). The higher the grade, the higher chance it will start affecting your nerves (\u2026because it\u2019s getting squished). I have a grade 2\u2026 it\u2019s getting there.\n\nThe combination of those four conditions makes me feel like I\u2019ve got a load of bricks on my shoulders no matter where I go.\n\nThe pressure on my spine is INTENSE. I can only walk 1/3 of a kilometre before I feel it. It hurts to bend my back\u2026 so maybe you can see where I\u2019m going here. What requires bending when taking care of a home? Silly question, I know. But honestly, my spinal conditions affect a lot of things in my life.\n\nI can\u2019t lift anything heavy\u2026 it\u2019s added weight to the bricks I\u2019m already carrying.\n\nIt hurts to do the laundry. Switching the clothes from washer to dryer\u2026 ugh.\n\nIt hurts to load and unload the dishwasher. Repetitive bending? No, thanks.\n\nVacuuming puts a lot of pressure on your low back, even if you don\u2019t realize it. I do. It hurts. So I can only vacuum a little bit at a time. One section a day.\n\nI can\u2019t walk or stand for too long. Necessary things like grocery shopping, I need to brace myself for. No, really. You see me pushing a cart? It\u2019s probably because I\u2019m using it as a walker.\n\nActually, speaking of bracing. I have a back brace. I also have a knee brace because the whole ordeal is starting to have some effect on my knees. Lucky me.\n\nSo that\u2019s why my house is a mess.\n\nIt used to bother me. It took a while for me to accept that I can\u2019t function the way I used to. It\u2019s either I clean my house like a mad woman and then be out of commission for days or\u2026 I clean what I can \u2014 when I can \u2014 so that I am still \u201cuseful\u201d.\n\nSo what\u2019s with the sweats?\n\nI\u2019m a homebody. I LOVE to stay home. I go out if I have to\u2026 you know\u2026 grocery shopping and the like. But if I have a choice\u2026 I\u2019ll be at home. There is no need to \u201cdress to impress\u201d. I live in my sweats because it\u2019s comfortable. Imagine being in pain and uncomfortable. Not pretty. No thanks. I\u2019ll pass.\n\nTruth: I love my sweats.\n\nSo please don\u2019t judge me. Don\u2019t judge my messy house. It\u2019s messy because I don\u2019t want to be down for the count. It\u2019s messy so that I have the capacity to take care of everything else.

Adrenaline hit me, and then anxiety flooded over me. Photo: Pixabay I found myself in the corner on the floor in the break room. Unable to effectively quit this job immediately (like I wanted to). Right? I mean I could walk away and go home. I could enjoy the rest of my day. I was in fact frozen by emotions, trying to catch my breath. Trying to survive.\n\nNever had it been this bad, never had my anxiety elevated so quickly into a complete shut down. I felt guilt and shame for this for a long time following. If I couldn't handle this old dude and his unreasonable response to cream being present in his coffee... how could I handle any aspect of life.\n\nI quit that job that day. I was a teenager triggered into an anxiety attack and triggered into a response of flight. It would be years before I realized I can manage this.\n\nThat's what it does. For me anxiety results in a fight or flight mentality. When you've fought too long you end up in a frenzy of flight (which looks different for everyone). For me at that time it meant shut down, close the doors and hide. Life is full of the weathered old faces of anxiety, and I wasn't ready for it.\n\nPhoto: Pixabay My youth was leading up to that pressure point. I didn't know that being a wobbly kneed anxious teenager, with so many thoughts of \"not enough-ness\" didn't make me less of anything. In reality, I was a strong leader, I was a creative, and I was an empath. Feeling deeply, and the parallel of that was deep response. Everything the intensity of youth offers.\n\nExperiences with anxiety offered a lesson. For me, I was determined and committed to working and achieving my goals. I never wanted to be on the floor in the corner again. I knew there were things that supported being strong in myself, and also being ok with anxiety and recognizing it as another tool. In a way giving a tip of the hat when I could see it coming, nothing more. I don't have to stop, but I need to acknowledge that it's there.\n\nNow, I talk about anxiety as overwhelm, and I have my ways of supporting myself. The bravery of calling it what it is and talking about it is huge. Our youth, and our communities shouldn't suffer in stigma.\n\nWe all have different ways of experiencing anxiety at different levels. We are not alone in this. Anxiety and Depression of America Association (ADAA) show that over 40 Million Americans (18% of the population), and in Canada The Anxiety Disorders Association of Canada (ADAC) reports 12% of Canadians) experience it in any given year. The most common mental health concern in Canada is highly treatable.\n\nDisclosure: I'm not a health care professional or expert. Always seek proper medical care. I share my experience as entertainment purposes only.\n\nIn my experience bouts with anxiety result from lack of self care and awareness. Unfortunately when it goes that far I've ended up not being my best self, making rash decisions and sometimes damaging relationships.\n\nWhen I'm depleted my mental immunity is too.\n\nPhoto: Pixabay\n\nWhat I do now. I focus on my health, nutrition, sleep, meditation and breath. These things have supported me greatly. I take time out when I need. That can look like committing to a couple days unplugged so that it doesn't turn into thirty.\n\nI look back at my younger years and can see how unsupported my physical self was.

For this, I am called a liar.\n\nI am not a liar.\n\nTo the edge and back\n\nI\u2019m transgender, meaning the gender that was assigned to me at birth doesn\u2019t match the gender I identify with. For most of my life, I couldn\u2019t articulate this feeling in a coherent way.\n\nI started struggling when puberty hit, around age 12. I watched as my body turned what felt to me grotesquely masculine, and my mind began to feel as though it was in a fog of testosterone. My brain was like a Camry someone had tried to fuel with diesel \u2014 it wasn\u2019t meant to run on testosterone. I wished I could be like the other girls in my class. Something just seemed right about who they were, how they were.\n\nI sank into a depression that lasted for years. I didn\u2019t understand why. I tried therapy, anti-depressants, anti-convulsants, and anti-anxiety medications. They didn\u2019t help. I finally gave up trying to fix it. I thought there was nothing I could do.\n\nAt age 26, after years of repressing these feelings, the dissonance between my mind, body and life itself became too much to handle. Every morning I woke up feeling more shame and anxiety than ever before. I took up smoking, a habit I\u2019d kicked nearly two years prior. I couldn\u2019t sleep without drinking, and I often drank until I couldn\u2019t walk. Still, the feelings persisted. I considered suicide.\n\nThen in late May of 2012, I came out to my girlfriend of 5 years, pouring my heart out, doing the best I could to explain the toll that ignoring this has taken on me. It\u2019s a hard thing to put into words.\n\nBy that October, after months of working with a therapist specializing in gender-related issues, I had begun hormone replacement therapy. Simple enough. I took medication to reduce the testosterone in my system, the very hormone that had nearly destroyed me, and I gave myself a weekly injection of estradiol, one of the more common forms of estrogen found in pubescent and post-pubescent women.\n\nA few months later, I\u2019d begun to experience the physical and mental impact of the hormones, and with it a new sense of clarity, peace and happiness. The chronic aches in my joints and pains in my stomach that had been a staple of my life since puberty dissipated. My mind and body began repairing themselves. It\u2019s as though my brain was meant to run on estrogen my whole life.\n\nBut why?\n\nWhy am I like this? Honestly, I don\u2019t know. There are a number of theories rooted in medicine, one of the most prominent being a 2006 study , published in the journal Psychoneuroendocrinology, by Schneider, Pickel and Stalla.\n\nThe study suggests that the amount of testosterone a fetus is exposed to in utero is directly linked to one\u2019s likelihood of being transgender. In other words, prior to my birth, I may have been exposed to too much or too little testosterone while in my mother\u2019s womb, causing my brain to develop differently than that of the average baby boy.\n\nNo matter the cause, this is, and has always been, a part of me. If I could have, I would have chosen to be born congruent, mind and body. I didn\u2019t choose this, but I\u2019m making the best of what I have.\n\nI know who I am\n\nI am a woman, but on such a frequent basis, I\u2019m told this is not true. I\u2019m told that I\u2019m \u201cgenetically\u201d or \u201cbiologically\u201d male. I\u2019m told that I\u2019m not a \u201creal woman.\u201d\n\nI have to ask: What constitutes a \u201creal woman?\u201d\n\nHow am I not one? Is it because of my chromosomes? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair, as neither you nor I know what my chromosomes even are. Someone who makes this argument assume they\u2019re XY, but I don\u2019t even know that for certain, as I\u2019ve never had a karyotype test. It\u2019s probably a safe bet that my detractor hasn\u2019t had a karyotype test, either. Even if I do have a Y chromosome, that doesn\u2019t mean anything. There are a number of women with Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome, sometimes giving them an XY set of chromosomes, which, typically, would be associated with men. Are they not women? In fact, there was even a recent case of a woman with XY chromosomes who gave birth to a daughter with -- you guessed it -- XY chromosomes.\n\nAdditionally, a September 16, 2013 article in the New York Times (\u201cDNA Double Take\u201d) examines recent studies on the DNA of women. \u201cIn 2012, Canadian scientists performed autopsies on the brains of 59 women. They found neurons with Y chromosomes in 63 percent of them.\u201d 63 percent!? Wow. A separate study, conducted at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, discovered that 56 percent of the women they investigated had a Y chromosome, based on a sample of their breast tissue. This goes to show that being a woman is about more than whether you have two X chromosomes.\n\nIs the reason that some disqualify me from womanhood related to the fact that I can\u2019t birth a child and don\u2019t have a uterus? If so, do they also reject the womanhood of infertile women or those who have had a hysterectomy? It\u2019s true that I wasn\u2019t born with a uterus, but neither was Jaclyn Schultz, Miss Michigan 2013. As a result of Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser syndrome (MRKH), she was born perfectly healthy, with the exception of her missing uterus (which also resulted in an inability to menstruate). 75,000 women in the United States have MRKH. Are they \u201creally men?\u201d\n\nIs it the fact that I wasn\u2019t \u201csocialized as a woman\u201d that excludes me from womanhood? Is it that I was \u201csocialized as a man\u201d? Well, so were these girls in Afghanistan. They were \u201craised as boys\u201d until they were well into their teenage years. Are they not women?\n\nLet\u2019s move on to the most obvious objection to my womanhood: It would take sexual reassignment surgery (SRS), also known as vaginoplasty, for me to ever have a vagina. So that \u201cmakes me a man\u201d? Tell that to women born with vaginal agenesis, a condition present in 1 out of every 5,000 female infants, where a child is born without a fully-formed vagina. This condition may require surgical intervention (i.e. vaginoplasty) in order to create a vagina. Does this negate their femaleness as well?\n\nNone of these factors (chromosomes, reproductive organs, socialization, genitals) cancel out the fact that the girls and women I mentioned above are, in fact, girls and women. I sincerely doubt that most people would so much as question the womanhood of the women I described. After all, it\u2019s not their fault that they were born with anomalies. How am I any different? I didn\u2019t choose to be transgender.\n\nI\u2019m different, and I\u2019m okay with that\n\nI don\u2019t want \u201cspecial treatment,\u201d I just want to be respected as a human being, as deserving of dignity as anyone else. I want to be able to exist in the world without the core of my identity, something that I grappled with for more than a quarter century, being dismissed by someone who couldn\u2019t possibly understand what it\u2019s like. I want to be able to go to work without worrying about being fired for who I am. I want to be able to use the restroom without fear of being beaten or accused of having malicious intentions. Like everyone else, I want the world to see me for me.\n\nIs that really so much to ask, to be treated like everyone else, to have the same rights and protections as everyone else? From a legal and public accommodations viewpoint, that's really all any of us are asking for.\n\nBeing transgender is a medical condition. Like so many other conditions, if left untreated, you're bound to wind up the bearer of a host of related symptoms.

I was there against my will \u2014 my mom had scheduled an assessment for me after noticing a dramatic weight loss in a short period of time. I was certainly perturbed, but not entirely distressed just yet. I felt confident that I wouldn't be diagnosed with an eating disorder and my doctor would set my mom straight by telling her that she was simply overreacting.\n\nThe pediatrician listened to my mom's side, then asked me why I thought I didn't have a problem. \"Because people with eating disorders are thin,\" I asserted, feeling slightly annoyed that I had to explain such an obvious thing to a medical doctor. Needless to say, my answer didn't exactly go over well. I left the doctor's office with a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa and the name of a therapist who specialized in eating disorders.\n\n\n\nLike many other eating disorder patients, outpatient therapy wasn't enough to save me, or even help me. I continued to lose weight, and every single meal at home turned into a power struggle with my mom. We both cried all the time \u2014 she because she couldn't understand why her only daughter was trying to starve herself to death, and I because I couldn't believe that no one understood how important this weight loss \"mission\" was to me. Several months after my initial diagnosis, severe medical complications led to my hospitalization in an eating disorders unit.\n\nI won't bore you with the dates, details, and specifics of every hospital stay \u2014 some of them have even become a bit blurry to me as I've moved forward with my life. But between the ages of 13 and 24, I was hospitalized seven times in a variety of medical hospitals and residential treatment centers. I spent my fourteenth and nineteenth birthdays hospitalized. I missed out on countless personal, academic, and even professional opportunities because I was fighting to stay alive. I wouldn't wish this experience on anyone \u2014 but I also believe in making the best of every life situation we're faced with and I can't deny that I learned a lot during my time in treatment. Although my eating disorder certainly doesn't define me, it's undeniably a part of my history and I refuse to pretend that it never happened \u2014 because the things I learned and the relationships I formed during treatment have shaped the person I've become.\n\n\n\nTo be clear, the recovery process is different for everyone. But, based on my experience, the experiences of close friends and what I've witnessed, here is what I wish I'd known when I began the recovery process.\n\n\n\n1. It's Not A Straightforward Path\n\nMy mom recalls that, during my first hospitalization in eighth grade, my case worker repeated to her ad nauseam that this would be my first and last time in treatment for two reasons: \"She's young\" and \"You caught it relatively quickly.\" She understandably felt hopeful and confident that these words were true.\n\nA few weeks into my stay, my mom had a long conversation with the parent of a fellow patient who was in the hospital for the third time. She disclosed the details to me years later, when I was in college and about to enter a residential treatment center in Pennsylvania. \"She told me it was going to be a long, rocky road and it would feel never-ending,\" my mom recalled, \"but I tried to not let it discourage me. I pushed her words out of my mind. But, in the end, she was right.\"\n\nTo be clear, some people do recover after one hospitalization and we shouldn't enter the process assuming that it won't work. But 80 percent of people with eating disorders relapse at least once. The reason I think it's important to note this is because relapsing doesn't equal failure, and it sure as hell doesn't mean we should give up. Since many people with eating disorders are perfectionists, we feel like failures when we backslide. Just six months after my release from the hospital, I found myself on medical leave from my freshman year of high school. But it didn't feel like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu \u2014it simply felt humiliating because I knew that I hadn't gotten it \"right\" the first time.\n\nOn my first day back at the same hospital, I tearfully confided these feelings to a nurse I'd bonded with during my initial stay. She assured me that my situation wasn't uncommon and that many patients need to return to treatment. Furthermore, returning to the hospital doesn't erase everything you learned the first time around or mean that your initial treatment was completely pointless \u2014 sometimes, it's just the first step in a long process.\n\n2. You're Fortunate To Have Access To Treatment\n\nUnfortunately, many insurance companies fail to provide adequate coverage for individuals with eating disorders \u2014 mainly because it remains a misunderstood illness that's stigmatized and minimized. Some families end up in legal battles with their insurance companies, while others resort to tactics like putting down a second mortgage in order to pay for treatment out of pocket. So, even if you don't want to be in treatment, try to put it in perspective \u2014 many people wish they could be where you are right now, but are unable to access or afford help.\n\nEven if you're still grappling with whether or not to embrace recovery, take advantage of the individual and group therapy sessions that are offered. Since, at their core, eating disorders are not about food or weight, treatment gives you the opportunity to explore all the underlying issues that triggered your illness in the first place.\n\n3. You'll Meet Lifelong Friends\n\nAnother reason to be open to the process is because you'll meet some truly amazing people in treatment. Again, even if you're unhappy or angry about being in the hospital, there are still upsides \u2014 and one of them is the friends you'll make. I met one of my very best friends in the hospital and, today, I literally cannot imagine my life without her because she's both the most fun person I've ever met and the one I can call at 4 a.m. on a rough night. Although this particular friendship has changed my life, I've stayed in touch with many people I met in treatment \u2014 they keep me motivated and they know me in a way that other people don't. Plus, you know you've found a true friend when they've seen you at your absolute worst (like, for example, crying hysterically as you defiantly throw a weight gain supplement on the floor) and they still want to hang out with you when you're back out in \"the real world.\"\n\n4. But Sometimes, You & Your Friends Will Be In Very Different Places\n\nRecovery is a long, complicated, and messy process for everyone \u2014 so it's inevitable that you're not always going to be on the same page as the friends you meet in treatment. This isn't inherently problematic, because it can give you the opportunity to help a friend who is feeling stuck, and vice versa. When you're in a good place with your own recovery, it's an amazing feeling to be able to help someone else. And, when you're in a dark place, no one can understand or help you more than a friend who has been there, too, and gotten through it.\n\nBut sometimes, you'll need to create some distance between yourself and your \"treatment friends\" \u2014 especially if you're super committed to recovery and they're less committed, or even (for lack of a better word) anti-recovery. While being in different places is not a reason to end a strong friendship, it's something to be conscious of, because you need to prioritize your recovery. Sometimes, seeing a friend restrict their food intake or simply talk nonstop about their weight is too triggering to handle. It's OK to limit your time with someone if their behaviors and words have a negative impact on your recovery. It doesn't mean you're closing the door on the friendship for good \u2014 it just means you're taking care of yourself.\n\n5. The Recovery Process Can Sometimes Be More Painful Than The Eating Disorder Itself At First \u2014 But It's So Worth It\n\nAlthough the causes of eating disorders are extremely complex and vary greatly depending on the individual, the illness is generally a coping mechanism for issues including depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Although I suffered both physically and mentally due to my eating disorder, it had an overall numbing effect that in the short term was incredibly comforting. I was so damn hungry all the time that all I could think about was food \u2014 and those thoughts distracted me from my PTSD flashbacks and anxiety. My mind didn't have the space or time to deal with anything other than food or weight, so I was able to block out many incredibly painful emotions, memories, and realities.\n\nWhen you have your coping mechanism taken away from you, it's jarring because you're suddenly forced to deal with your actual feelings and your true insecurities \u2014 and this pain is far more complex than any distress caused by the number on the scale. Many of us feel worse before we feel better, because treatment forces us to eat \"normally\" and we haven't yet developed new, healthy coping strategies.\n\nBut, when we embrace treatment, we can learn how to handle our emotions in a healthy manner. Again, everyone is different \u2014 so not every coping strategy is going to work for every eating disordered individual. There may be a period of trial and error and it will probably be frustrating. There will be times when you want to throw in the towel. Please don't do that, because you'll be robbing yourself of all the amazing opportunities life has to offer. Sometimes, it takes a while to find the right therapist, treatment strategy, and medication \u2014 but you will find it as long as you don't give up.\n\nI had an eating disorder for over half my life and, at times, I told my therapist that I believed I simply \"wasn't meant to recover\" and it was time for us both to give up. I couldn't have been more wrong \u2014 no one is meant to live with an eating disorder. We all deserve better, and we are all capable of fighting the illness and winning. If it feels excruciating at times, it probably means you're doing something right \u2014 and it won't feel that way forever. Be kind to yourself, because eating disorders take a tremendous toll on both your body and your mind. Treatment can be challenging and painful \u2014 but, above all, it's so rewarding and worth the hard work .\n\nImages: Pexels; Giphy (5)", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/141458-5-things-i-wish-i-had-known-when-i-entered-eating-disorder-treatment", "summary": "I left the doctor's office with a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa and the name of a therapist who specialized in eating disorders.\nLike many other eating disorder patients, outpatient therapy wasn't enough to save me, or even help me.\nSeveral months after my initial diagnosis, severe medical complications led to my hospitalization in an eating disorders unit.\nI couldn't have been more wrong \u2014 no one is meant to live with an eating disorder.\nBe kind to yourself, because eating disorders take a tremendous toll on both your body and your mind.", "timescraped": 1513838732.142028, "category": {"words": 1872, "personal": 78, "thirdperson": 26, "condition": 0, "recovery": 5}}, "8843f419f07d3c1a7162e786176845d2": {"title": "What To Expect After A Double Mastectomy: I'm a 32-Year-Old BRCA1 Gene Carrier, And I Went Through The Challenging Process", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost%2F2016%2F9%2F13%2Ffccf8d2a-302d-484c-8ea6-27dd2976c9c3.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "text": "I tested positive for the BRCA1 gene mutation, also known as the breast cancer gene, in the spring of 2010, when I was 27. I was tested after my parents decided to share the news with me that my father was a carrier \u2014 he had been tested because his mother and her two sisters were all diagnosed with breast cancer in their early 30s. His two sisters passed away in their 30s, and my paternal grandmother died in her 40s. As a BRCA1 carrier, I was at a huge risk of facing breast and ovarian cancer myself. On July 30, 2014, I underwent a preventative double mastectomy, and, just six weeks ago on February 9, 2015, I had my implant exchange surgery. This was my final surgery of four in this eight-month process.\n\nIn an op-ed for The New York Times in May of 2013, BRCA1-carrier Angelina Jolie wrote about her choice to have a preventative double mastectomy herself, to guard against the 65 percent breast cancer risk that the BRCA1 gene indicates (though new research indicates the above statistic, at the time of her decision making, and mine, the risk was said to be 87 percent). This week, she detailed her recent laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy surgery, in which her ovaries and fallopian tubes were removed in order to guard against the 39 percent ovarian cancer risk (previously indicated at 50 percent) that also comes with being a BRCA1 carrier. Jolie has deservedly received much praise for bravely sharing her story, but, through no fault of hers, much of the response from the media and the general population has been overly simplistic \u2014 people are doubting Jolie's sanity, asking if she is being alarmist in taking these measures, and calling her choice fearful.\n\nIt's a positive thing that such a high profile person is raising awareness of this health issue and facilitating a discussion on a larger scale. But this topic is not a fleeting celebrity story, and the choice to have parts of one's body removed can't be taken lightly or treated flippantly \u2014 it's a choice that should be thoroughly digested by anyone who needs to consider this, and one that must to be treated with respect by the general public. I want to make sure that with this raised awareness comes knowledge and honest conversation.\n\nTesting positive for BRCA1 sucks, and there is no ideal path of care. The decision to have your breasts removed is not an easy or a pleasant one. People may question the decision, but the alternative, which is getting multiple mammograms and MRIs each year for the rest of your life, sucks too. It means spending time in cancer centers, and basically being treated as a cancer patient yourself. It means seeing what your life will be as a cancer patient if it comes to that. It means spending hours and hours away from work multiple times a year and, for me, it meant spending hours and hours awake at night thinking about my next screening, wondering if and when it would come back irregular. I am an anxiety-prone and action-oriented person, and when my doctors and genetic counselors relayed to me that having a double mastectomy was their ultimate recommendation, and the way to decrease my risk most dramatically, I knew it was the right decision for me. But people need to know that there are no appealing options here.\n\n\n\nIt's a positive thing that such a high profile person is raising awareness of this health issue and facilitating a discussion on a larger scale. But this topic is not a fleeting celebrity story, and the choice to have parts of one's body removed can't be taken lightly or treated flippantly.\n\n\n\nThere are so many other things that people need to know about this process, and so many things that people who are considering or have decided to undergo the surgery must to understand and expect. I wish I had known these things eight months ago.\n\nKnow that the process will be all-consuming\n\nFrom the day of my mastectomy until right now, my life has been about this. I had some complications, so my path of care took some unexpected directions along the way, perhaps making my focus on my recovery a little more intense and lengthy than others. That said, I don't see how anyone could go through this and come out of it without it taking an enormous toll, physically and psychologically. You need to be ready to give your life over to this for a while.\n\n\n\nMake sure you pick the right doctor\n\nWhen choosing your doctors (both a breast surgeon to conduct the mastectomy and a plastic surgeon to work with you throughout the reconstruction process), it's extremely important that you feel completely comfortable with these people. It is definitely a good idea to meet with more than one person, even if you feel comfortable with the first person you meet. However, it's an overwhelming process, so meeting with too many candidates is not ideal either.\n\n\n\nYour plastic surgeon is who you will have the longest term relationship with, and with whom you'll spend the majority of your care path interacting. Make sure you push your doctors and ask questions that make you uncomfortable. You need to be certain that your doctor is ready to hear, listen, and respond to you. You're in a partnership with one another through this, and the trust that I had in my plastic surgeon, the amount I've had to rely on him, and the level at which I've needed to communicate with him is unparalleled to anything I've experienced before in a personal or professional setting.\n\nDon't panic if your care path doesn't go according to plan\n\nI underwent a nipple-sparing bilateral double mastectomy, with tissue expanders placed during surgery. Then, over multiple months, my tissue expanders were filled between 25CCs and 100CCs of saline at a time in order to eventually reach 525 CCs, which is the size of my implants. It's an extremely strange sensation to have your chest filled with fluid. For some women this is painful, though I only experienced tightness and discomfort.\n\n\n\nThis procedure is considered low-risk by the medical community, and conducted every day by surgeons world-wide. That said, it is important to understand that every case, and every person's body, is its own. In my case, I experienced one of the potential complications that can result from mastectomy, necrosis of the skin. This means a portion of my skin did not recover post-mastectomy. I was successfully treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy, but I met a few other challenges along the way, which ultimately delayed my reconstruction process.\n\nThankfully, with the incredible skill and thoughtfulness of my plastic surgeon, and with his insight about how to treat me, my current health is fantastic and I am thrilled with the cosmetic outcome of my breasts since I had my implant exchange surgery on February 9. If you do experience complications, there are ways to redirect the care path that will result in a satisfying \u2014 or even wonderful \u2014 outcome.\n\nFigure out a plan with your employer\n\nI'm fortunate enough to have had the resources to go through this process in as comfortable a way as I could have imagined. My family and friends have been so supportive and helpful \u2014 as has my employer. They were flexible with my hours and flexible about my working from home near the end of my recovery. My company health insurance is excellent, and I was able to arrange in advance to take four weeks of short term disability sick leave immediately following the mastectomy.\n\nMy current health is fantastic and I am thrilled with the cosmetic outcome of my breasts.\n\n\n\nThough many people may not be as lucky as I am, it's important to have a plan in place in advance for how you want to handle your time away from work (which can be as few as three and as many as six weeks). Speak to your manager about your path, and make sure you know your company's health insurance policies and medical leave protocol. Prepare for your transition back to work. This was not a vacation, you are not rested, and your mind is likely not completely at ease. Your body may be healed, but you have experienced a life changing event and you may need to adjust your expectations of yourself for a while.\n\n\n\nExpect surprising everyday things to be different\n\nYou won't be able to wear your own bras. You'll have to figure out what outfits look good over the front-clasp Fruit Of The Loom sports bra you'll wear during recovery. Getting jostled around on the subway will go from a mild annoyance to a truly painful experience. Wearing seatbelts will hurt for a while, as will driving a car in general. You'll feel self-conscious about hugging people when your chest is full of the hard expanders between surgeries. You can't sleep in the same positions as before. Your doctor may say that you'll be able to exercise three to four weeks following surgery, but if your exercise routine, like mine, involves running half marathons and attending vigorous spin and boot camp classes several times a week, it will be a long time before you can return back to normal.\n\n\n\nYou can be told what this experience looks like and understand how it mechanically works, but to experience what that means on a day-to-day basis is an entirely different beast.\n\n\n\nPrepare to watch your body change\n\nThe idea of getting a set of perky implants for the rest of your life is fun, but the body you were born with is beautiful, and it is a very sad thing to lose a piece of the body you've grown up with, to lose a piece of your womanhood.\n\nIt is a very sad thing to lose a piece of the body you've grown up with, to lose a piece of your womanhood.\n\n\n\nYou cant imagine an experience where you suddenly no longer have breasts and over months, through multiple procedures, they miraculously return. You don't get to just swap your old breasts for your new ones, and it's a very strange process to watch your body change \u2014 to feel your body in clothes, to look in the mirror. Your body is in a different form than the one you've lived with your entire life, and though I'm thrilled with my results, I'm still waiting for my body to get back to something I\u2019m comfortable with and accustomed to.\n\nPrepare for this to affect your romantic life\n\nI\u2019m single, and I think it would have been easier to go through this with the support of a partner \u2014 and it would have been easier to not have to re-enter the dating world with a piece of my body that is unfamiliar to me, let alone to a potential mate.\n\n\n\nI didn't date between my mastectomy and my exchange surgery except for a couple blind first dates, and I didn't feel driven to. I'm extremely emotionally vulnerable right now, and that's not really a time when you ever are looking to meet new people, let alone dive into a relationship that could inherently make you more vulnerable. And, during some stages of the process, the physical reality of my body made me feel the least sexual that I could have felt. It will take some time, even after feeling great about my physical appearance again, to really get to know my body, and to feel that level of desirability.\n\nIn making this decision, you prioritize your options based on a holistic view of what you think is best for you and your health, and if that involves a different version of your physical body then it is what it is. And today, I think I look great.\n\n\n\nI just want other people who are contemplating this decision to be better equipped with information on what to expect. There is no way I could have known going in even a fraction of what this experience would be like, but I know this was the right decision for me.\n\nAs told to Julie Alvin", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/71915-what-to-expect-after-a-double-mastectomy-im-a-32-year-old-brca1-gene-carrier-and-i-went", "summary": "I tested positive for the BRCA1 gene mutation, also known as the breast cancer gene, in the spring of 2010, when I was 27.\nAs a BRCA1 carrier, I was at a huge risk of facing breast and ovarian cancer myself.\nKnow that the process will be all-consumingFrom the day of my mastectomy until right now, my life has been about this.\nDon't panic if your care path doesn't go according to planI underwent a nipple-sparing bilateral double mastectomy, with tissue expanders placed during surgery.\nI just want other people who are contemplating this decision to be better equipped with information on what to expect.", "timescraped": 1513838733.475013, "category": {"words": 2046, "personal": 40, "thirdperson": 19, "condition": 0, "recovery": 2}}, "4b4543ccba7632654e9c6fffe61e2c8b": {"title": "Do Snapchat Memories Disappear?

So even though Snapchat has introduced a Memories feature, I still need to know: Do Snapchat Memories disappear? I mean, the first time I showed my mom Snapchat, she was horrified \u2014 not because of the filters (which are, admittedly, jarring), or because I made the mistake of telling her how the app was frequently used in its early days (rhymes with \"mexting\"), but because the messages disappeared within a matter of seconds. So what about Snapchat Memories? Are they, too, ephemeral, like dreams? Because that's how my brain is conditioned now. To believe nothing good can stay. Not even that cute AF dog filter.\n\nSo, OK, if you have not heard about Snapchat Memories, or Snapchat at all, you're probably a little confused right now. Let's clear that up: For the uninitiated, Snapchat is a social media platform that allows users to send pictures and videos to friends. The catch: You set a timer, and after a maximum of 10 seconds, the image disappears. For-Ev-Er. (Unless you screenshot them, but that's a whole different story.)\n\nBut in a blog post last week, Snapchat announced a new feature that will undoubtedly change the Snapchat game: Snapchat Memories. Not seeing the Memories option on your own phone? Then you may need to make sure you have the latest Snapchat update. Yes, I know: Updates. They are a pain.\n\n[Embed]\n\nOnce you do have the update, though (and have no fear \u2014 the Snapchat team will actually send you a chat to let you know when you do), all you have to do is swipe up from your main screen and you'll reach a \"Memories 101\" page, with all the FAQs a technology-challenged gal like myself could ever want. I'll let you take a look yourself. Me trying to explain it will only make things worse.\n\nBut here is maybe the best part: Snapchat Memories don't disappear. Not ever. Not unless you want them to. You can even import photos from your camera and older, saved Snaps into your Snapchat Memories. Did your phone break? Just log back into Snapchat and it's all. Right. There.\n\n[Embed]\n\nDo you know what this means? We're going to start seeing Snapchat slideshows at weddings. Scrapbooking is going to come back into fashion, only this time, it'll be ~digital.~ Our visual memory banks are going to be populated by the dog filter and the tiny mouth filter that makes everyone look like an Uggs-wearing high schooler named Tiffany and weird, bad geotags.\n\nRelationships will be memorialized by \"Our First Snap\" and \"Breakup Snap\" and \"I told you I loved you with a Snapchat sticker Snap,\" and like, wow, the more I think about it, the more I'm thinking this new Snapchat update is going to change the world. Because until the interwebs crash and we're thrown into a post-internet world (not out of the question, TBH), that time you saw a man riding one of those giant-wheeled, old-time-y bicycles through downtown Chicago traffic will never be forgotten.

Decide On Your Answer Before You Go In\n\nYou should have an answer ready in your head before you waltz in. Be honest with yourself, though, and don't make up weaknesses you think will make you appear a certain way. Chances are the person who is conducting the interview has a pretty good nose for BS. When you sit down to contemplate what your answer will be, try to stay away from specific skills you lack, as well as abilities that have absolutely nothing to do with the job you're after. For example, Jacquelyn Smith of Forbes says a graphic designer shouldn't list finance as one of their weaknesses.\n\nReview the job description once again in order to get a better sense of what they're looking for in an employee. You can shape your imperfections around the particular traits they want to see; the quicker you're able to do that, the faster you make your value known to the company.\n\n2. Stay Focused On A Work-Related Weakness\n\nIn other words, don't talk about your failed relationship and how you constantly \u2014 and unsuccessfully \u2014 date emotionally unavailable individuals who don't do their own laundry. Career coach and writer Amanda Abella tells Forbes readers to avoid shedding light on personal dramas. A job interview is not the time and place for that muck. Your employer wants nothing to do with your messy love life, and talking about it in a setting like this will only make you appear like you aren't taking the whole thing seriously.\n\nSteering the conversation away from work-related stuff is a big red flag. No matter what the position may be, a boss is always looking for professional individuals who understand boundaries very well, and who truly get the separation between personal life and office life. Keep this in mind as you fight for your next job.\n\n3. Have A Sense Of Humor About Yourself\n\nIt's a serious question, I know, but a little comic relief can go a long way. Dearest Auntie E. Jean, long-time columnist for Elle magazine, once wrote about her experience with answering this question in a job interview with Roger Ailes of Fox News \u2014 and how her quirkiness landed her her very own talk show. She joked about how she despises other writers, how she tends to overexaggerate, and how she needs to learn to be more \"unkind\" with others, all the while being enthusiastic and fully engaged. The old saying held true for her: It's not what you say, it's how you say it.\n\nHumor holds many underlying messages, and when used correctly, it proves how confident you are in yourself, regardless of what your weaknesses are. Your best self will come through and you're bound to put a smile on the face of the person holding a clipboard.\n\n4. Talk About How You've Worked To Stregthen The Weakness\n\nThis second part of your answer is crucial, or else you'll leave the table on a sour note. After you've honestly listed your edges, talk confidently about how you've done some personal work to strengthen these not-so-perfect parts. This will help your interviewer see that you take yourself and your job seriously, and it shows that you can take initiative. Try to focus on things you have actually conquered, though, not the characteristics you're still struggling with.\n\nLaura DeCarlo, founder of Career Directors International and writer for Job Hunt, calls this the \"strength in disguise\" method, and it comes in two parts \u2014 confession and recovery \u2014 kind of like a one-two punch. You admit your shortcomings, only to follow it up with how you've used them to grow. Say you're a career changer without much relevant experience; your grand finale can be that you've become a quick learner and you can easily adapt to any situation.\n\n5. Don't Say Generic Things\n\nYou might be tempted to say you're a perfectionist or that you simply work too hard. Rookie mistakes, though. Smith says employers have heard these phrases far too many times, and they don't hold much value. Plus, this is just a way of shirking the question, which leaves your potential future boss to think that you aren't aware of your own weaknesses.\n\nIt's better to be original with your answer (but only if it's honest!) so that they remember you clearly. Aim for specificity so you don't fall into the stereotypical categories. Another generic thing you want to dodge at all costs is refusing to answer the question. That's a big, huge, enormous no-no; you're basically saying that you have no interest in cooperating.\n\n6. Avoid Permanent Statements\n\nWording is a tricky thing, but the more you pay attention to detail, particularly in the language you use, the more articulate you will be in those crucial moments. People will often times start their answer with \"I can't\" or \"I'm not good at,\" which makes it seem like you have permanent issues that you don't have any chance in resolving. Donald B. Richardson, head of leadership development organization called the Richardson Group, recommends you frame the matter differently. Instead of saying \"I'm bad at this,\" talk about the things you prefer doing, and how you're working on getting better at the first task.\n\nBy speaking of your weaknesses as temporary factors in your life, you also give off the idea that you are a constantly changing, evolving human being who doesn't get stuck on the negatives. This allows you to remain positive; it also shows the interviewer that your mind is focused on improving.\n\nAbove all, be optimistic about your upcoming interview. You have a lot to offer, there's no doubt about it \u2014 so walk in fully prepared with your head held high.

In an attempt to reach their level of calmness, it can help to look at the daily habits of people who never get stressed . Although everyone has their obstacles, some people just seem to be doing something right when it comes to handling their emotions and problems,\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you have daily habits that are functioning to calm you down, center you, and relax you, your stress levels in general will be lessened,\" says psychotherapist Kristen Martinez to Bustle over email. \"If you remind yourself to take a few minutes to just breathe when you're under a stressful situation, you can more easily work past the stress to think more clearly. The reverse can be true, too: If your daily commute is grueling, for instance, and you get frustrated every day about the amount of traffic and any delays, that stress will undoubtedly leak into your larger outlook for the day and will make you more tense.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough avoiding stress altogether is impossible, if you participate in the right daily activities, you can help minimize your negative emotions. If you want to relax and destress, try adapting these 11 habits of people who don't get stressed.\n\n1. They Practice Deep Breathing\n\n\"This sounds like an obvious one, and it is,\" says Martinez. Despite it's obviousness, most people don't pay particular attention to how they breathe throughout the day. \"When we are caught up in a tense situation, we are probably breathing shallow, quick breaths,\" Martinez says. But taking in deep breaths can relax your body, which eliminates its fight or flight response that causes panic and tension, according to Harvard Health.\n\n\n\n2. They Are Mindful\n\nEven if they don't spend every single day meditating, people who don't get stressed pay attention to the present as much as possible. \"Mindfulness means slowing down the thoughts that might be racing through your head, noting each thought, but not following it away. The intention is to keep you always focused on what is happening in that very moment. When you remind yourself to pay attention to the present, you are much less likely to be carried away by overwhelming feelings of stress, anxiety, and worry that are future-oriented,\" says Martinez.\n\n\n\n3. They Have A Good Laugh\n\n\"Having a sense of humor and making sure you laugh every day is so important to managing stress response,\" says Dr. Kathy Gruver, PhD, LMT, CHt over email. Laughter releases endorphins, stimulates your heart and lungs, and improves circulation, all which help to cool your stress response, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\n\n\n4. They Practice Gratitude\n\nBeing thankful is not just reserved for Thanksgiving. \"Even just taking five to 10 minutes out of your day and journaling what you are thankful for on that particular day can help decrease worry, increase your focus on the positive (fighting our brain's negativity bias), and help your sleep,\" says Martinez.\n\n\n\n5. They Exercise\n\nWorking out is not just for your body. People who stay calm know that exercise is not only a good outlet for their frustrations, but it helps to make changes in their body chemistry that keeps them calm as well. \"Exercise helps produces feel-good hormones in the brain,\" says Gruver. \"Regular exercise is a great way to help manage stress.\"\n\n\n\n6. They Sleep Well\n\nStress and sleep go hand in hand, and healthy people combat their stress by making adequate sleep a priority. A study from the University of Pennsylvania found that people who are sleep-deprived report being more stressed, angry, sad, and mentally exhausted. \"When you can get into a stable sleep schedule, you no longer have to worry about getting by the next day on a handful of hours of sleep,\" says Martinez.\n\n\n\n7. They Eat Healthy\n\n\"This one seems like a no-brainer too, but it goes back to the mind-body connection,\" says Martinez. Healthy foods contain nutrients that help combat your body's reaction to stress. \"Additionally, when you're eating poorly, you may be groggy, uncomfortable, and consequently stressed about these symptoms and probably the larger picture of your health,\" she says.\n\n\n\n8. They Monitor Their Caffeine Intake\n\nIt might seem like loading up on coffee can help you power through your day, but it also may unknowingly be your cause of stress. \"Increased caffeine = increased symptoms of anxiety in the body,\" says Martinez. Research from the journal Advances in Psychiatric Treatment shows that caffeine can exacerbate anxiety in people who suffer from the disorder.\n\n\n\n9. They Spend Time With Friends\n\nPeople who don't get very stressed have good, healthy, supportive relationships. \"Studies show that that human connection and interaction tend to decrease the stress response,\" says Gruver. \"It also allows us to lean on others in times we need extra support.\"\n\n\n\n10. They Get Outside\n\nStress can make you want to curl up into a ball inside your bed, but people who don't get stressed spend much of their time outdoors. Research from Stanford University found that even a short walk in nature reduces stress and improves wellbeing.\n\n\n\n11. They Take Time To Disconnect From Work\n\nWork is a major cause of stress for many people, so it's important to make some boundaries between your work life and your personal life. A study from the Journal of Occupational Health Psychology found that psychological detachment from work during non-work time is important for employee recovery and health.\n\n\n\nEveryone gets stressed, but practicing the right daily habits can help give you the power and control to prevent your emotions from overwhelming you.\n\nImages: Pixabay (12); Isla Murray/Bustle", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/159102-11-daily-habits-of-people-who-dont-get-stressed", "summary": "In an attempt to reach their level of calmness, it can help to look at the daily habits of people who never get stressed .\nIf you want to relax and destress, try adapting these 11 habits of people who don't get stressed.\nThey Are MindfulEven if they don't spend every single day meditating, people who don't get stressed pay attention to the present as much as possible.\n\"Studies show that that human connection and interaction tend to decrease the stress response,\" says Gruver.\nEveryone gets stressed, but practicing the right daily habits can help give you the power and control to prevent your emotions from overwhelming you.", "timescraped": 1513838739.889447, "category": {"words": 941, "personal": 7, "thirdperson": 23, "condition": 2, "recovery": 2}}, "66906415a7b5ea4c05d23f19e1a367e0": {"title": "Hobbies For Reducing Anxiety That Really Work", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/2017/2/5/7be1d988-197f-414f-9337-2f26878f217b.jpg?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "text": "Unfortunately, none of us are immune to anxiety. Anxiety doesn\u2019t discriminate based on gender, sexual orientation, financial status, age, or literally anything else that can define a person\u2019s position in society. The fact is, no matter who you are, life will never stop being unpredictable and anxiety-inducing from time to time. So whether you\u2019re one of the 40 million American adults who deals with an anxiety disorder, or your anxiety is almost always tied to a stressful life event, (like breakups or final exams) you should probably take some time to learn about the types of hobbies that can reduce anxiety.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019ve always been an anxious person. My first anxiety attack happened at seven years old, and my first depressive episode happened at 12. Because of this, I\u2019m fairly well-acquainted with the many ways you can reduce anxiety and depression naturally. That said, what has historically worked for me might not work for you. So instead of just telling you to get high and go to the gym like I often do when my anxiety is out of control, I reached out to an anxiety expert. Luckily, Barrie Sueskind, MFT, a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist who specializes in helping clients overcome anxiety, agreed to speak with Bustle about the hobbies that can alleviate anxiety.\n\nHere are a few of the hobbies that Sueskind suggests to anyone who\u2019s suffering from anxiety.\n\nPainting & Journaling\n\nIf you start feeling anxious during your downtime, Sueskind suggests taking the night off of social media so you can embrace your inner artist. Sueskind also says it's not a bad idea for anyone suffering from anxiety to delete all social media apps from their phones. Instead of logging hours of precious free time scrolling your Twitter/Instagram/Tumblr/Facebook feeds, Sueskind says you should instead \"try something creative \u2014 paint or do some writing.\"\n\nPersonally, I've found that painting while listening to Edith Piaf and drinking wine always sorts me out. (Though wine can increase anxiety if you're not properly hydrated, so maybe double-fist your booze with water.) Working your way through a coloring book or journaling your thoughts can be just as soothing. The point is, even if you don't think of yourself as highly creative, it's worth your mental health to find a creative hobby that you'll enjoy.\n\nReading For Fun Or Watching An Engaging TV Show\n\nSueskind tells Bustle that one of the best ways to distract yourself from your own worries is to redirect your focus onto the concerns of others \u2014 whether those concerns are real or imagined. So if you don't have a library card or an active Netflix account, you might want to remedy that. Sueskind points out that, sometimes, relieving anxiety can be as simple as taking the time to \"read an engaging book (or find a tv show you love) so you can lose yourself in other people's stories for awhile.\" If you're rarely in the mood to watch TV or sit still with a novel for hours, fiction podcasts (like Welcome to Night Vale) and audio books are a couple of alternative options to consider.\n\nSpending Time Outdoors\n\nPexels\n\nSpending time in nature is my personal go-to for relieving anxiety, primarily because it mixes movement with exposure to the sun. According to Sueskind, I'm on the right track with this. \"Fresh air and sunlight are proven mood boosters.\" Whether you choose to hike, bike, or bird-watch, you should know that outdoor hobbies are super-effective at alleviating anxiety. Further, if you're one of the many anxiety sufferers who also deals with depression, getting outside on a daily basis will benefit your mental health even further.\n\nSo don't let winter weather keep you from enjoying the great outdoors. In my experience, as long as you're properly bundled, the cold actually feels pretty fantastic.\n\nPracticing Mindfulness\n\nA huge part of managing anxiety is learning how to conquer the chaos in your head, and mindful hobbies can help you achieve this goal. Hobbies that force you to be more present are great, because they can help you stay grounded when it feels like anxious thoughts are figuratively attacking your brain. \"Mindfulness practices \u2014 like yoga, meditation, or even going for a walk or hike \u2014 can help slow racing or unwanted thoughts,\" Sueskind says.\n\nAs someone who sits all day for work, I've found that walking meditation does more to relieve my anxiety than yoga or stationary meditation. That said, yoga is essentially free medicine, and you can do it without ever leaving your home. The same things can be said of stationary meditation, too. So if you need help figuring out how to meditate while sitting still, (because finding your center can actually be really difficult sometimes) then check out this article on meditation for beginners.\n\nWorking Out\n\nSince it's no secret that exercise is good for anxiety, I highly doubt this hobby recommendation comes as a great surprise to you. That said, even though we all know exercise eases anxiety, not everyone gets jazzed about fitness. So if you (like myself) genuinely enjoy exercise, awesome. Keep doing what you're doing. If you feel like working out is basically just torturing yourself to a killer soundtrack, then you might want to try signing up for badass, goal-oriented fitness classes (like martial arts or hip-hop dancing) that you'll actually be excited to show up for.\n\nTaking Self-Improvement Classes\n\nIt's hard enough to juggle work, alone time, self-care, and socializing without adding a weekly class into the mix. However, if you're looking for hobbies that can combat anxiety, you should at least try to squeeze in a self-improvement class once in awhile.\n\nWhether you want to get better at cooking, brush up on your Spanish, or earn your pilot's license, Sueskind says taking classes is a must for anxious people. If you start spending more of your time and energy on self-improvement, then you'll simultaneously boost your self-esteem and distract yourself from whatever triggers your anxiety. As Sueskind explains it, \"Learning a new skill will require you to focus on the task at hand.\" So not only will taking classes empower you as a person, this particular hobby should help minimize the hold anxiety has over you and your life.", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/p/hobbies-for-reducing-anxiety-that-really-work-35613", "summary": "Luckily, Barrie Sueskind, MFT, a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist who specializes in helping clients overcome anxiety, agreed to speak with Bustle about the hobbies that can alleviate anxiety.\nHere are a few of the hobbies that Sueskind suggests to anyone who\u2019s suffering from anxiety.\nWhether you choose to hike, bike, or bird-watch, you should know that outdoor hobbies are super-effective at alleviating anxiety.\nAs someone who sits all day for work, I've found that walking meditation does more to relieve my anxiety than yoga or stationary meditation.\nHowever, if you're looking for hobbies that can combat anxiety, you should at least try to squeeze in a self-improvement class once in awhile.", "timescraped": 1513838741.297048, "category": {"words": 1040, "personal": 10, "thirdperson": 2, "condition": 21, "recovery": 0}}, "a499a2439b19d7f85785a0a33575099f": {"title": "11 Ways To Know That Your Body Is Slowing Down & Needs Rest", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost%2F2016%2F10%2F6%2Fbd131fc2-fd47-4fac-90eb-946ee488852a.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "text": "When we're hit with fatigue, we just know that our bodies are crying out for help and need some serious rest and recovery to bounce back and function optimally once again. Thus, knowing the signs that our bodies are tired and need a break can help us give it the help it needs as soon as possible in order to start feeling more agile, fit, energized, and capable of moving through life's busy tasks.\n\nAs a certified health coach, I work with clients on feeling healthy and awesome in their bodies, without pain, anxiety, or other physical complications holding them back from doing their best, being the most productive, and enjoying recreational activities, such as exercise and sports, that can enhance quality of life and fitness efforts. When our bodies are too tired to function well, from carrying us through mundane tasks and errands, such as wandering through the grocery aisle, to kicking some serious butt in kickboxing (or whatever activity you enjoy!) class, it can really interfere with our mental and physical wellbeing. Here are 11 ways to know that your body is tired and in need of break, and some of the ways in which you can give it the assistance it needs to bounce back beautifully.\n\n1. You're Not Sleeping Enough\n\nBrandon Berman, Reverie in-house sleep expert says over email with Bustle that if you don't get enough sleep, it can take a toll on your body and result in fatigue and muscle aches over time. \"Sleep gives your body energy by allowing it to reset, recover, and rebuild; without sleep, your body is left feeling sluggish, depleted, and weak,\" Berman says. Aim to score between 7-9 hours nightly, as advised, for optimal recovery and restoration.\n\n\n\n2. Your Body Is Cramping\n\nIf you are experiencing joint pain, cramping, headaches, and muscle fatigue, it could be a sign that your body is breaking down and needs some rest to recover and become less inflamed, says Dr. Douglas Bibus, Coromega Scientific Advisory Board Member, over email with Bustle. As a recommendation, Bibus says, \u201cOmega-3 fatty acids have been found to reduce discomfort and inflammation associated with cramps. They can even decrease other symptoms such as headaches, nausea and fatigue.\"\n\n\n\n3. Your Workouts Are Harder\n\nIf you experience pain or soreness during a workout, it might mean your body is tired. Darin Hulslander, nutrition coach and trainer, tells Bustle over email, \"general soreness can effect your workout from a form perspective. Muscle soreness is likely to decrease your range of motion in many exercises. The best thing you can do is assure you recover if you are sore by doing light cardio or even a rest day or some yoga. Also make sure you are both foam rolling and stretching prior to exercise.\"\n\n\n\n4. Your Lips Are Cracked\n\nMichael J. Breus, PhD, a board-certified expert in clinical sleep disorders explains in interview with Daily Burn that dry lips can signal dehydration, which can affect sleeping patterns and bodily functions. Thus, if you notice this symptom, you should hydrate immediately to give your body the resources it needs to thrive and get back to feeling alert and refreshed.\n\n\n\n5. Your Appetite Is Off\n\nStress can be felt all over the body, says Todd Nief, personal trainer and owner of South Loop Strength & Conditioning over email with Bustle. \"Stress hormones like cortisol play an important role in mobilizing blood sugar, but we end up with an interesting dichotomy in that corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) inhibits appetites and glucocorticoids stimulate appetite. So, the folks who overeat when stressed may have a tendency to produce more glucocorticoids or may clear them from the bloodstream more slowly,\" Nief explains.\n\n\n\n6. You Have Nagging Injuries\n\n\"Nagging injuries are often signs that your body needs a break,\" says running coach and personal trainer Susie Lemmer over email with Bustle. If you notice that your body is chronically experiencing wears and tears or nagging injuries, then it might be an indicator that you need to slow down or dial back your workouts. Taking care of that body is #1.\n\n\n\n7. You're Stressed AF\n\n\"We have been socialized to thrive best in states of busyness and 'striving to get ahead,'\" says therapist Chelsea Hudson, LCPC, over email with Bustle, and explains that this urgency has lead to chronic stress. \"In my recent clinical work I have witnessed a steep increase in both burnout symptoms and 'break related anxiety.' When overexertion has become one\u2019s automatic mode of functioning, taking a break can often be experienced as anxiety provoking because of the unfamiliarity and ambiguity,\" Hudson says. Hudson recommends taking a break and working to overcome this fear.\n\n\n\n8. You're Working Too Many Hours\n\n\"People often define themselves by their work and fear a loss of identity if they slow down or take a break,\" says Hudson. Due to this mentality, it's likely to over-exert yourself in the office and work too many hours, leading to fatigue, irritability, and other appetite changes due to an inconvenient schedule, she explains. Hudson recommends clocking in and out at a set time in order to schedule enough \"me time.\"\n\n\n\n9. You're Moody\n\nIf you notice that you are chronically moody or depressed, it might mean that you are overworked and need a break, says Noam Tamir, Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist and owner of TS Fitness New York City in interview with CNN. Check in with yourself to see how emotional you are. If you are positive or neutral, you're okay, but if you see yourself being quick to snap or are in a general funk, it might be time to seek a therapist's help or slow down.\n\n\n\n10. Your Heart Rate Is Whacky\n\nTamir also explains that an abnormal heart rate, whether too high or low, can express signs of being overworked and in need of a break. Your body might be lower if it is prone to overtraining, for instance, or higher if it is stiff and sore and might be unable to follow through on an intense workout. For these times, take it slower or take a whole rest day to yourself.\n\n\n\n11. You Have Trouble Concentrating\n\nIf you notice you have brain fog and have a hard time concentrating, it means that your body might be too tired and the physical effects are influencing your mental capabilities, as explained by healthy lifestyle coach Liz Traines over email with Bustle. If you find yourself missing deadlines or having a hard time staying focused, it might be time to slow down.\n\n\n\nIt's natural for your body to need a break, as it's hard to juggle a million things, fit in workouts, check off your errands, and stay active all the time without adequate rest and recovery. If you notice you're slowing down, take some time to refresh yourself and get back to a happy and productive state.\n\nImages: Pixabay (11); Pexels (1)", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/182023-11-ways-to-know-that-your-body-is-slowing-down-needs-rest", "summary": "Here are 11 ways to know that your body is tired and in need of break, and some of the ways in which you can give it the assistance it needs to bounce back beautifully.\n\"Sleep gives your body energy by allowing it to reset, recover, and rebuild; without sleep, your body is left feeling sluggish, depleted, and weak,\" Berman says.\nYour Workouts Are HarderIf you experience pain or soreness during a workout, it might mean your body is tired.\nYou Have Nagging Injuries\"Nagging injuries are often signs that your body needs a break,\" says running coach and personal trainer Susie Lemmer over email with Bustle.\nIf you notice you're slowing down, take some time to refresh yourself and get back to a happy and productive state.", "timescraped": 1513838742.5588422, "category": {"words": 1142, "personal": 11, "thirdperson": 8, "condition": 3, "recovery": 4}}, "4bd88cd6101c6e40dd2d3905804ac0cc": {"title": "Women Reveal Postpartum Depression Struggles & It's A Powerful Reminder That We Need To Talk Openly About PPD \u2014 VIDEO", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost/2016/9/13/32d33f44-29a8-45ba-ab55-96f3222cfc2f.png?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "text": "According to research, postpartum mood or anxiety disorders sadly affect 1 in 7 women pregnant and new moms, a stat we don't often talk about and too easily sweep under the rug. But this month, Jill Krause of the parenting blog BabyRabies has partnered with nonprofit Postpartum Progress to shine some much-needed light on the condition by letting the women who've suffered (and survived) tell their own tales. In a new video produced by PostpartumProgress.org, seven women share their postpartum depression stories candidly and without hesitation. In raw, emotional interviews, each mother shares just how intensely depression and anxiety enveloped them in the months after they gave birth \u2014 and they're hoping that by opening up, they'll encourage others who suffer to seek help, too.\n\nPostpartum depression is often confused with what's commonly called the \"baby blues,\" but in reality, PPD is far more serious. The \"baby blues\" are typically defined as lasting between one and two weeks and involve mood swings, irritability, and loss of sleep. In contrast, PPD involves all of those symptoms and then some, but all with much greater intensity. According to the Mayo Clinic, the symptoms of postpartum depression include loss of appetite, difficulty bonding with your baby, and incredible feelings of sadness. And these aren't just fleeting moments of insecurity, either \u2014 they're crippling lows.\n\nAs one woman shares in the video, these lows are often accompanied by thoughts of suicide.\n\n\"I felt like ... I would be able to rest if I could die.\"\n\nOthers struggled with intense mood swings and anger issues \u2014 and candidly admitted just how far this really went.\n\n\"I really wanted to act out this anger on inanimate objects, or on my husband. It was such a weird feeling.\"\n\nOne mom even described the chronic anxiety that would follow her throughout her day, preventing her from feeling \"normal.\"\n\n\"My stomach always felt like when you miss a step when you're going down the stairs and your stomach jumps.\"\n\nBut in every case, there was a light at the end of the tunnel.\n\n\"Once I did get help, I knew I can always be the mom that I wanted to be.\"\n\nAnd that was a feeling almost beyond words.\n\n\"I mean, it was really a moment where I felt like... I'm kinda me again.\"\n\nAs for their advice to other moms who may be suffering the same symptoms?

You feel right now like you're going to feel like this for the rest of you life, but it does get better.\"\n\nSpeaking with The Huffington Post last week, Krause said, \"We are working to erase the stigma of perinatal mood and anxiety disorders, and to let people know where moms can start to find help. And nothing gets that point across more than the inspiring message found in the video's YouTube description, which reads: \"We are strong, we are fighters, we are good moms, and we are here for you if you are struggling, too.\"\n\nIf you or someone you know may be suffering from Postpartum depression, call your doctor immediately.

According to WebMD, there are several different types of anxiety disorders. Panic disorder involves feelings of terror that strike suddenly and repeatedly with no warning \u2014 or in other words, panic attacks. Someone who suffers from social anxiety disorder may feel overwhelmingly self-conscious about everyday social situations. And generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by excessive, unrealistic worry and tension, often unprovoked. One way WebMD notes that doctors can diagnose anxiety disorder is by assessing how much anxiety symptoms interfere with a patient's daily functioning. However, a website can't perform the duties of a trained mental health professional, so if you're wondering if your anxiety is normal, you should see a doctor.\n\nEven though the internet can't diagnose anxiety disorder (and a recent study found that online symptom checkers are wrong most of the time anyway), if you are worried that your level of anxiety isn't normal, it might help to talk to people you know who have an anxiety disorder and hear their experiences. That might have been the motivation behind this Reddit thread that asked the women of AskWomen how they realized their anxiety was not normal and required professional attention. The answers are really eye-opening and give really good insight into what living with anxiety disorder is like.\n\nA lot of commenters expressed difficulty dealing with college life, especially in the dining hall. User milkradio wrote, \"I lost a lot of weight in my first year of college because I just wouldn't go to the dining hall because of the anxiety of it all. I couldn't bear the thought of going alone and picking out meals and sitting by myself, etc.\" Another commenter said she ended up dropping out of college because if she missed a class she would just never go back \u2014 she was too afraid of how the professor might react to her missing class. It makes sense \u2014 college is a huge transition \u2014 but it's extra unfortunate given that many colleges offer mental health services.\n\nWhile it's great this woman got treatment for her anxiety, user thebloodofthematador points out that things like chest tightness and difficulty breathing could also be symptoms of a heart attack, and that if your doctor immediately diagnoses you with anxiety, you should get a second opinion. \"There are multiple documented cases of women dying from heart attacks because that's what their symptoms were actually signifying, but their doctors dismissed them as being anxious or having a panic attack,\" she wrote. Scary, but important to know.\n\nThis story has a happy ending, at least: The OP later commented:\n\n2 years after that \"head on the door\" point and I've moved to a country halfway across the world on my own to live in a house of strangers who I now call my friends. I still struggle with anxiety constantly, and am shy when with people at first especially in groups. But now I don't let it keep me down and I can control it better.\n\nSo if you do have anxiety, just know that with the right help, things can get better.\n\nBelieve it or not, a lot of commenters identified with this vicious cycle.\n\nAnxiety can have physical effects that feel very real \u2014 it's kind of scary how the brain can do that.\n\nThat is a very interesting metaphor, but a useful one.\n\nAs with many mental health problems, people who suffer from anxiety disorder are often shamed and told to \"stop being lazy\" or to \"just get over it.\" But as user fyred_up wrote, \"Please don't think [anxiety is] something you have to get over yourself. Going to a professional doesn't make you weak or a quitter or anything of that sort. You don't have to live like that.\" Mental illness in general is something we have to stop stigmatizing, and anxiety disorders are no exception.\n\nImage: Alexander Lam / Unsplash", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/189796-how-to-tell-if-your-anxiety-is-normal-according-to-women-of-reddit", "summary": "Panic disorder involves feelings of terror that strike suddenly and repeatedly with no warning \u2014 or in other words, panic attacks.\nSomeone who suffers from social anxiety disorder may feel overwhelmingly self-conscious about everyday social situations.\nAnd generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by excessive, unrealistic worry and tension, often unprovoked.\nOne way WebMD notes that doctors can diagnose anxiety disorder is by assessing how much anxiety symptoms interfere with a patient's daily functioning.\nThe answers are really eye-opening and give really good insight into what living with anxiety disorder is like.", "timescraped": 1513838721.747136, "category": {"words": 681, "personal": 10, "thirdperson": 13, "condition": 23, "recovery": 0}}, "bb3fa6b2da66854febceb7f11c8f9294": {"title": "8 Things People With Generalized Anxiety Disorder Want You to Know", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost%2F2016%2F9%2F13%2Fa5a4bc67-55c5-45d0-a487-c176677b3fbc.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "text": "I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder. It is usually shortened to GAD, which is hilarious to me. Someday I will write my memoirs and they will be called \"EGADS!\" No one will read that book, except for maybe my mom and some people who buy it in a clearance bin at Barnes & Noble accidentally, thinking it is a book about Egon from Ghostbusters. To those fine folks, I would like to apologize now, well in advance of this event occurring and well in advance of me, you know, writing the book to begin with.\n\nIf you don't know what GAD is, let me put on my finest teaching robes and share some of the basics: Feeling nervous of shy or worried about things from time to time is a totally normal part of the human experience. But, feeling nervous, worried, shy, and anxious all the time, to the extent that it prevents you from doing things, from living your life \u2013 that's GAD. People with GAD battle it everyday. Sometimes, we win. Sometimes, like the time I literally locked my doors and hid under my bed rather than go on a first date, we don't. The point is, it can be complicated. And more than that, generalized anxiety disorder is often wildly misunderstood. Here are 8 things people with GAD want you to know:\n\nI Know It Can Be Annoying\n\nMy anxiety can be annoying. Super annoying. It's annoying for me, and it's annoying for other people. Please know that anxiety sufferers are very aware that the consequences of our anxiety are annoying. For example: I do this ridiculous thing where (in addition to drugging myself and drinking a mountain of scotch) in order to fly on an airplane, I tap a very specific part of the outside of the plane three times. You know, to make sure it stays up in the air. If you're behind me, don't sigh with irritation that I'm taking three extra seconds out of your day to do that. I know it's annoying, and now in addition to thinking of my impending death by plane, I'll be thinking about how much you, a total stranger hates me, and I won't be able to stop.\n\n\n\nRelationships Are Harder For Us\n\nOh my god, this is a big one. Relationship of all kinds \u2013 romantic, professional, familial, neighborly \u2013 are affected in almost every conceivably way by the presence of anxiety in our lives. People with GAD often feel the need to check in constantly, or to do the opposite, and disappear completely and without warning or explanation. We have a tendency to try to control situations so that we aren't presented with any outcomes that might find us surprised and unprepared. This is tough on the people we date. Really, it's tough on anyone in our lives, but it can be especially challenging for romantic partners since they are so intimately involved and emotionally connected to our behavior. Our fights are bigger and longer, and it takes us a very long time to fully trust anyone and feel like we can be ourselves. Our break-ups are epically awful; All we do is think about what we did wrong \u2013 for years. It's awesome.\n\nBeing Anxious Is Different Than Being Shy\n\nI get so wigged about meeting new people that I will sometimes throw up. Actual throw-up, not hyperbolic throw-up. Sure, we've all been shy or nervous, but for GAD sufferers, this is our default state. Please don't brush us off, or act like it's an adorable personality trait.\n\n\n\nIt's a Real Thing \u2013 A Very Real Thing\n\nYou would not believe the number of people I've met who don't think GAD is real. I'm not immature, or dramatic, or crying out for attention: I literally begin to sweat and freak out sometimes for no actual reason. Come here and let me wipe it on you if you don't believe me.\n\nEverything Is Hard\n\nGetting out of bed, picking clothes to wear, figuring out what to eat, standing in line at the post office, smiling at a co-worker \u2013 these are things you do almost every day. If you've got GAD, just listing them is exhausting because you see not just the list, but the hours of circling thoughts that go into each task. Please understand that for every little facet of normal, daily functioning that you do mindlessly, for someone with chronic anxiety, making those things happen takes a monumental feat of strength and bravery.\n\n\n\nWe See The World Differently\n\nOn a good day, you might see the world as rife with potential and possibility, whereas, even on a good day, we will see it as being dauntingly riddled with challenges. We see the world differently, which is not always a bad thing. We also think more about what's going with other people, and can be totally insightful. It can also result in getting lost in a mental tailspin of what-ifs and worst case scenarios.\n\nWe Would Give Anything to Change\n\nIt should go without saying, but I'll say it anyway: We don't love any part of living with anxiety. We go to therapy, we take meds, we take risks...we do what we can to mitigate the damage anxiety does to our lives and relationship, and we try to manage it, but it's a process. We're not this way because we want to be. Living with GAD means being permanently engrossed in an ongoing effort to feel healthy and strong, and that effort has its ups and downs.\n\n\n\nIt's The Best Thing Ever When You're There For Us\n\nIf you're our friend, we will love and appreciate you to the end. A good friend to a GAD-haver isn't overly sensitive, but they're aware. They dig the person, illness or no, and while we may not always express it: we appreciate you, and the way you understand and support us, more than we could ever say.\n\nImages: Kevin Dooley/Flickr; Giphy(4)", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/46593-8-things-people-with-generalized-anxiety-disorder-want-you-to-know", "summary": "I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder.\nAnd more than that, generalized anxiety disorder is often wildly misunderstood.\nHere are 8 things people with GAD want you to know:I Know It Can Be AnnoyingMy anxiety can be annoying.\nPlease know that anxiety sufferers are very aware that the consequences of our anxiety are annoying.\nIt's The Best Thing Ever When You're There For UsIf you're our friend, we will love and appreciate you to the end.", "timescraped": 1513838723.097705, "category": {"words": 1009, "personal": 53, "thirdperson": 5, "condition": 10, "recovery": 1}}, "94e30d4b4b6f7b51c5bbb88c64e3b1a4": {"title": "11 Things That Can Happen If You Have Elevated Anxiety Levels", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/2017/3/9/76868f76-b81f-44c5-9844-bd57706e00d2.jpg?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "text": "It's one thing to be antsy before a big deadline at work or a public speaking event; however, if you're chronically anxious, and not really sure why, it could signify that you have elevated anxiety levels. If you think you could be suffering from too much tension each day, it's best to figure out ways to calm your worries and feel more calm and in control. If you're too wound up regularly, it can affect your body, mental performance, and mood.\n\nAs a certified health coach, I work with clients on feeling more relaxed in the day and getting rid of tense moments when they spring up. If you notice that you're feeling on edge a lot lately, and it doesn't seem to go away, it could be an indicator of larger, generalized anxiety that can become even stronger with time. Think about your feelings and surroundings: did something trigger your anxiety? If it's been resolved, are you still anxious? These types of questions can help you better understand the levels and scope of your anxiety and how best to handle it. Here are 11 signs that you might have elevated cortisol levels and are actually worrying way too much.\n\n1. You Feel Threatened\n\nAccording to Rita Milios, LCSW, an expert writer for Pro Corner on Recovery.org, over email with Bustle, \"Anxiety always involves some type of fear, usually internalized as a slightly panicky feeling inside. If anxiety is heightened, this panic sensation is also heightened, and may lead to a sense of dread with feelings that a threat is present.\" If you feel on edge and scared, without a valid cause, it could be due to too much anxiety.\n\n2. You Have Panic Attacks\n\nPanic attacks can happen \"due to the body's natural aversion to feeling fear,\" says Milios. \"Panic attacks differ from normal anxiousness in both degree and onset. Panic attacks happen suddenly and usually feature extreme symptoms, including unusually intense feelings of dread and feelings that something very bad is happening, to the point of feeling that one is dying or losing control. Physical symptoms, such as a racing heart, dizziness, trouble breathing or chest pains, although triggered by the anxiety itself, also seem to confirm the worst,\" explains Milios.\n\n3. You Have Higher Blood Pressure\n\n\"Anxiety and increased stress causes hormone levels to change and elevates your heart rate and blood pressure,\" says Dr. Partha Nandi M.D., F.A.C.P, creator and host of the Emmy-award winning medical lifestyle television show, \u201cAsk Dr. Nandi\u201d and Chief Health Editor at WXYZ-TV (ABC) Detroit over email with Bustle. \"The brain sends signals to the adrenal glands (organs that sit atop your kidneys), which release hormones, including adrenaline and cortisol. Adrenaline causes the heart rate and blood pressure to increase. Cortisol elevates the level of sugar, or glucose, in the bloodstream to boost energy. Cortisol also suppresses processes that influence mood, motivation, and fear,\" Nandi explains.\n\n4. You're Low In Energy\n\n\"Increased anxiety can also cause low energy levels,\" advises Nandi. If you notice that you're lacking in energy and motivation, and you're super anxious, it could be damaging to your productivity. To prevent this effect, speak with someone for help with taming your tension.\n\n5. You're Getting Sick Often\n\nIf you're getting sick often, it could be due to high cortisol levels and a compromised immune system. Nandi suggests that having high anxiety can impair your immunity and cause you to be more exposed to infections and germs. Your body won't be able to handle these obstacles as well.\n\n6. You're Not Interested In Sex\n\nNandi says it's common to not be interested in sex if you're struggling with intense anxiety. The cortisol can interfere with a healthy libido. If you're skipping out on intimate time with your S.O. between the sheets because you're worrying or tense, it's time to find ways to feel more calm and free.\n\n7. You Have Digestive Issues\n\nNandi says that having digestive issues, like irritable bowel syndrome, for instance, can happen if you're suffering from chronic anxiety. If you notice you're having poor gut health and stomach pains, especially when you're tense, it's probably due to greater cortisol spikes.\n\n8. You Can't Sleep\n\nAccording to Elizabeth Ann Shaw, MS, RDN, CLT, over email with Bustle, if you're experiencing trouble sleeping or bouts of insomnia, it could be related to higher levels of anxiety and stress. If you're losing hours regularly, it can sabotage your wellbeing and productivity at work.\n\n9. You're Irregular At That Time Of The Month\n\nShaw says that it's normal to experience a change or fluctuation in menstruation if you're under major, chronic stress and have too much cortisol flowing through your body. If you notice any irregularity, check with a physician and consider finding outlets to for relaxation to see if it helps.\n\n10. You're Noticing Muscle Pain\n\nIf you're experiencing tension in your muscles and joints, without a clear reason relative to physical activity, such as a new fitness program or a different body motion during a class, it could be associated with high anxiety levels. If you think this is the case, try something relaxing, like a massage or yoga to ease the pain, and seek help from a professional.\n\n11. You Avoid Certain Places & Situations\n\nIf you're avoiding certain people, places, or scenarios due to fear, anxiety, or negative emotions, it could be due to a generalized anxiety disorder, or even a social phobia. If you notice this pattern, seek help from a therapist to help conquer your fears and find more comfort in approaching these obstacles.\n\nIf you notice these symptoms, it could signify a intense level of anxiety, and if left unresolved, it can seep into other areas of your life and cause disturbance. Seeking help from a professional can help in finding recovery.\n\nImages: Pixabay (12)", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/p/11-things-that-can-happen-if-you-have-elevated-anxiety-levels-43030", "summary": "It's one thing to be antsy before a big deadline at work or a public speaking event; however, if you're chronically anxious, and not really sure why, it could signify that you have elevated anxiety levels.\nThese types of questions can help you better understand the levels and scope of your anxiety and how best to handle it.\nHere are 11 signs that you might have elevated cortisol levels and are actually worrying way too much.\nYou're Getting Sick OftenIf you're getting sick often, it could be due to high cortisol levels and a compromised immune system.\nIf you notice you're having poor gut health and stomach pains, especially when you're tense, it's probably due to greater cortisol spikes.", "timescraped": 1513838724.503289, "category": {"words": 981, "personal": 1, "thirdperson": 1, "condition": 11, "recovery": 0}}, "4788ea04a542e56134d5236a2f4c1efa": {"title": "PTSD Is More Common Than You Think, So Here Are 7 Things To Know About The Disorder", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost%2F2016%2F9%2F13%2F4a825d8b-0dee-4551-a9e9-dc2d12bcfdea.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "text": "June is Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Awareness Month, so there's no time like the present to educate yourself on the mental health condition that will affect approximately 7.8 percent of Americans at some point in their lives. Not everyone who experiences a traumatic event will develop PTSD, but many do. And as with any mental illness, cases of PTSD range from mild to severe.\n\n\n\nPTSD is diagnosed when someone experiences three types of symptoms for at least one month: flashbacks, avoidance, and hyperarousal (a state of increased tension and anxiety). PTSD sufferers may experience a wide variety of other symptoms, too, including intense flashbacks, nightmares, depression, detachment, and emotional numbness. But the one common thread among all PTSD sufferers \u2014 whether you were sexually assaulted, involved in a horrific car accident, or witnessed an act of terrorism \u2014 is that you lived through a terrible event that was out of your control, and left you feeling helpless. This feeling of helplessness is one of the things that makes PTSD so undeniably difficult to live with.\n\n\n\nBut the good news is that PTSD can be treated, typically through a combination of psychotherapy, medication, and the support of loved ones. The recovery process isn't easy, though; it can be painful and mentally taxing, and requires you to discuss memories and emotions that you would much prefer to bury. While treatment can certainly not erase the past and the memories will always exist, the flashbacks and hyper-vigilance can subside and you will be able to resume your day-to-day life with the peace and happiness you deserve. Most importantly, you'll be able to embrace the present and look forward to the future.\n\n\n\nIf you or a loved one are struggling with PTSD, here are seven important things to know:\n\n1. PTSD Has Many Different Causes\n\n\n\nPTSD was first brought into the public consciousness after doctors observed some of the symptoms exhibited by war veterans who returned from Vietnam. The American Psychiatric Association added PTSD to The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 1980. We now know that the illness can be caused by a wide range of events, including but not limited to: sexual assault, physical abuse, domestic violence, natural disasters, and car accidents. Witnessing a violent act can also cause PTSD \u2014 for example, if a child witnesses their parent being abused, they can develop the disorder, despite not being directly abused themselves. Typically, a PTSD sufferer continues to live in a state of psychological shock and is unable to process the associated emotions of fear and helplessness, long after the event that triggered their state has passed.\n\n\n\nIf an individual experiences symptoms in each of the below three categories for at least one month, they can be diagnosed with PTSD:\n\n\n\nRe-Experiencing: This category includes flashbacks, intrusive memories, nightmares, and feelings of extreme distress when reminded of the traumatic event.\n\nAvoidance: Symptoms in this group include detachment, inability to connect with loved ones, avoidance of any place or activity that reminds you of the trauma, and gaps in memory pertaining to the trauma.\n\n\n\nHyperarousal: These symptoms include severe anxiety, being easily startled, sleep disturbances, and inability to let your guard down.\n\n\n\n2. People With PTSD Are More Likely To Develop Other Illnesses\n\n\n\nIt's common for individuals suffering from PTSD to develop other health conditions \u2014 most commonly depression, anxiety, and substance abuse. Nearly half of individuals with PTSD also exhibit symptoms of depression. In an understandable attempt to self-medicate, 50 percent of PTSD sufferers develop a dependence on alcohol and 30 percent grapple with drug addiction. Eating disorders are also often linked to trauma \u2014 they can make PTSD-afflicted individuals feel a sense of power. And, like anyone who is under immense stress, PTSD sufferers are more prone to chronic pain and physical illnesses.\n\n\n\n3. Women Are More Likely To Develop PTSD Than Men\n\n\n\nAlthough women are slightly less likely to experience a traumatic event than men, females are twice as likely to develop PTSD. This is because the traumas most commonly experienced by women \u2014 specifically, sexual assault, domestic violence, and other physical abuse \u2014 are more intimate and personal, and thus, more likely to lead to post-traumatic stress. Because of factors like cultural conditioning, women also more likely to blame themselves for their traumatic experience.\n\n4. PTSD Is Not A Sign Of Weakness\n\n\n\nNot everyone who experiences trauma develops PTSD. But this doesn't mean those who do are weak or wallowing in self-pity. Just as some people have a genetic predisposition to develop depression, addiction, or certain physical illnesses, certain individual have a genetic makeup that makes them more vulnerable to PTSD. If someone is already struggling with depression, anxiety, or another mental illness, he or she is more likely to develop PTSD.\n\nOther risk factors include having family members with mental health issues, having a prior history of trauma, the severity and length of the traumatic event, and the amount of emotional support received immediately after the trauma. Individuals who have been subjected to repetitive abuse (i.e. domestic violence or ongoing sexual abuse) are also more likely to develop PTSD.\n\n5. PTSD Can Make It Hard To Live Your Life\n\nBeing in the throes of severe PTSD can feel a lot like drowning with no life raft in sight. Flashbacks, nightmares, insomnia, shame, and hyper-vigilance are often constant companions for sufferers. The illness can make it extremely difficult to function on a day-to-day basis, and sufferers are more likely to have\n\n\n\nIt's hard to develop trusting relationships with PTSD, and even the most stable existing relationships can be negatively impacted. Survivors may feel numb and detached from their loved ones, even when friends and family are supportive. Since one of PTSD's prime symptoms is avoidance and loss of interest in activities, sufferers may isolate and prefer to be alone. If the trauma involved someone the victim trusted (such as acquaintance rape or partner violence), it can be extremely difficult to continue trusting others close to them. This can be hurtful to family and friends who just want to help, but if someone you love has PTSD, remember that their distance isn't personal. The most important thing is to be patient and to let your loved one know that you are always there to listen when they're ready to talk.\n\nBeing in the throes of severe PTSD can feel a lot like drowning with no life raft in sight.

Getting Help Is Key To Recovery\n\n\n\nAfter experiencing trauma, anyone can be expected to be out of sorts (to say the least). But since not everyone develops PTSD, it can't be officially diagnosed until symptoms have persisted for at least a month. So if you are experiencing any of the symptoms previously noted, it is extremely important that you seek professional and personal help as soon as possible. A good therapist and psychiatrist are a must, and there are many mental health professionals who specialize in trauma.\n\n\n\nThere are a number of effective treatment techniques for PTSD (including EMDR, cognitive behavior therapy, and group therapy) and it may take time to find the right therapist and the right treatment track for you. It's important to find a therapist you click with and trust \u2014 this will make it easier to open up to them and follow their advice. Therapists can help you develop coping strategies for the flashbacks and regain a sense of control. The cognitive patterns typical of the disorder (such as self-blame and paranoia in ordinary situations) can be slowly but surely reversed through talk therapy. As you begin to utilize your new coping skills and adjust your thought patterns, your quality of life will improve.\n\n\n\nIn addition to therapy, medication can also be beneficial. The medications Zoloft and Paxil have been approved by the FDA for PTSD treatment and short-term use of benzodiazepines can help ease the anxiety and hyper-vigilance symptoms as you work to develop effective coping strategies in therapy.\n\n\n\nThe support of friends is also a huge help. The shame associated with traumas such as sexual assault and violence makes many people reluctant to tell friends about what they're going through. But any true friend will want to be there for you and support you unconditionally \u2014 so tell your friends in your own time and your own way. They'll be glad you told them \u2014 your openness will help them help you. HelpGuide offers comprehensive information about understanding and helping a loved one with PTSD.\n\n\n\n7. Recovery Is Possible (And It's Worth The Hard Work)\n\n\n\nA diagnosis of PTSD does not equal a life sentence of flashbacks, fear, and unhappiness. Approximately 80 percent of PTSD sufferers will recover, so the difficult process of opening up about your experience will pay off. You'll likely experience many ups and downs during the recovery process, and there will be times when you want to give up. But the most important thing to remember is that you don't want the illness to win. Be stubborn and fight back. You have a life to live, and there are so many opportunities out there for you to seize.\n\n\n\nAlthough the memories will always be a part of your history, recovered individuals are able to look back on the trauma without experiencing extreme distress. Better yet, they reach the point where they're not thinking constantly thinking about the trauma, and can instead go back to focusing on all the wonderful things life has to offer. They are also able to once again connect with loved ones and successfully engage in academic and professional pursuits. The best part of recovering from PTSD is that you no longer feel chained to the past and hopeless about the future. Feelings of self-blame and shame can be replaced by empowerment and pride \u2014 because you possessed the strength to not only survive an unthinkable event, but to move forward, into a future not defined by your trauma.\n\n\n\nImages: lst1984/Flickr; Giphy (4); aangtics, turquoisebones, ibelongwith-you/Tumblr\n\n", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/89241-ptsd-is-more-common-than-you-think-so-here-are-7-things-to-know-about-the", "summary": "Not everyone who experiences a traumatic event will develop PTSD, but many do.\nIn an understandable attempt to self-medicate, 50 percent of PTSD sufferers develop a dependence on alcohol and 30 percent grapple with drug addiction.\nAnd, like anyone who is under immense stress, PTSD sufferers are more prone to chronic pain and physical illnesses.\nWomen Are More Likely To Develop PTSD Than MenAlthough women are slightly less likely to experience a traumatic event than men, females are twice as likely to develop PTSD.\nApproximately 80 percent of PTSD sufferers will recover, so the difficult process of opening up about your experience will pay off.", "timescraped": 1513838725.782979, "category": {"words": 1835, "personal": 1, "thirdperson": 25, "condition": 7, "recovery": 3}}, "a684fce2c658531cb1564fc07dbb510a": {"title": "Exactly What Happens To Your Body When You Watch Horror Movies", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost%2F2016%2F9%2F13%2F1a02519d-3b02-4445-995c-858cdc13aeea.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "text": "We all remember the scary movie moments that shaped us. Mine was in Jurassic Park. Yes, that's right \u2014 Jurassic Park. The lowering of the cow into the T-Rex enclosure, followed by a bovine scream and the reemergence of a tattered cow-rope, haunted me for years. I have friends who won\u2019t go near deep water because of Jaws. Clowns seem to freak out basically everybody. But what actually happens to our bodies when we\u2019re watching scary movies \u2014 and why do some people actually enjoy it?\n\n\n\nAn ex-boyfriend, puzzled as to why I hated horror films, asked to show me one of the most gruesome films ever made (at the time it was banned in Australia, so I won\u2019t name it). The twist? The film has no suspense, no sudden shocks. And there\u2019s a lot of very twisted gore, but the subject of it is shown to be under sedation and feels no pain. The result? I wasn't scared at all. Without suspense or the threat of real bodily agony, my body simply didn\u2019t react, except with disgust. It\u2019s not the dark we\u2019re afraid of: it\u2019s what\u2019s lurking inside it, about to jump out at us.\n\n\n\nSo why do some people enjoy what happens to our bodies during horror films? We don\u2019t really know. There are a lot of theories: it might make us feel powerful to survive something so threatening, it might be an outlet for aggression in a basically peaceful society, or we may just like being scared in a safe space where we know we\u2019ll get out alive. (Unless the movie theater turns out to be showing Michael Jackson\u2019s Thriller. In which case we\u2019re all doomed to do the zombie dance.)\n\nWhat we do know, however, is what happens to our bodies when we watch scary movies. Let's take a look.\n\nYour Heart & Breathing Rates Explode\n\nHorror movies are, essentially, contained and mass-marketed fear. The suspense of the unknown, and the sudden shock of the appearance of Freddy Krueger or the Blair Witch or whatever your antagonist of choice, causes the body to experience terror \u2014 and nowhere is that more directly felt than in heart rate.\n\n\n\nAn increase in blood flow, from the heart to the extremities, is actually a very sensible evolutionary reaction to fear. The more blood is pumping, the faster you\u2019ll be able to move when something chases you, and it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a lion or some lunatic with an axe. Increased heart rate, with fear, also goes hand in hand with increased respiration rate \u2014 to get as much oxygen into the body as possible, in preparation for either fleeing or fighting whatever's scaring you.\n\nYour Muscles Tense\n\nMuscle tension is, as anybody who's ever had panic attacks attest, one of the body's most easily noticeable signs of significant fear. Panic attacks come out of nowhere with no threat in sight, but when the threat's on screen, you'll find your muscles automatically seizing up too. It's a classic response to stress or terror, and represents a signal from your body's noradrenaline (a hormone that carries messages around the body) to get ready for something big. Hence why you may find yourself unconsciously ripping up the arms of your chair in the movie theater.\n\nYour Cortisol Levels Rise\n\nGoing to a horror film actually puts your body under quite a lot of psychological and physical stress. You're putting yourself in what feels like a life-threatening situation \u2014 and even if you're conscious of the fact it's not real, your body isn't. (Indeed, the best films are the ones that conceal that fact as much as possible.) So it shouldn't be surprising that horror film watchers see the \"stress hormone,\" cortisol, rocket while they're watching knives in the dark.\n\n\n\nCortisol is a bit of a nasty one, as far as after-effects are concerned. It's linked with memory loss and psychological difficulties like depression. But, most worryingly, cortisol release also leads to the rise of bad memories from the past \u2014 because it's a part of how those bad memories got embedded in the first place. Stress from a horror movie may have the unintended effect of making you recall a bad breakup from six years ago, and you won't know why.\n\nYour Eyes Move More\n\nInterestingly, and probably for reasons similar to those that motivate your raising heart rate and breathing levels, when you're watching a horror film, your eyes also move considerably more \u2014 both from side to side and up and down. This seems to be specific to the movies, too: the study that discovered it focused on how our eyes and breathing react when we're facing down Hannibal Lector or Chucky.\n\nPart of that will be the experience of the movie itself. Horror films are often calibrated to keep your eyes moving, with lots of cut frames and frantic editing, to enhance the feeling of panic and claustrophobia. Not being able to keep focused on one thing may be a pretty useful psychological trick for triggering fear. But it also seems that rapid eye movement could help us track our enemies or threats \u2014 so it's not all that surprising.\n\nYour Adrenalin Levels Spike\n\nAdrenalin is the body\u2019s key response to stress or fear. It\u2019s the trigger for the fight-or-flight response, the enormous rush that leaves you panicky and, supposedly, ready for anything. And it's this factor that, some scientists think, may explain the real pleasure that some people experience in the wake of a massive scare.\n\n\n\nAdrenalin is not, generally speaking, great for you \u2014 but a huge burst of it in the body may lead to an unexpected feeling of pleasure. After an adrenalin rush, you may feel full of energy, extremely alive, and very alert, all qualities necessary for a quick escape from Frankenstein's monster. It's commonly reported in athletes, but for others it may be extremely worrying and uncomfortable to be so hyped-up, and the terror may outweigh the afterglow.\n\nYour Particular Brain Genetics React\n \n\n\nBut, crucially, the study didn\u2019t actually show the test subjects any films, just still pictures. So it\u2019s not yet known if this genetic doubling would have the same sort of affect on people in movies \u2014 where, after all, the impact is a product of narrative, music and suspense, not just blood spatter.\n\nA study in 2013 showed that another aspect of brain chemistry also affected our enjoyment of terror: how our brains react to dopamine release during a scary situation. Dopamine, generally thought of as a good-time chemical, is released in upsetting circumstances too, and may motivate some people to seek out terror. It seems clear that your brain chemistry has a pretty large role in how you respond to potential sources of fear or distress.\n\nImages: FX Networks, Giphy", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/112787-exactly-what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-watch-horror-movies", "summary": "But what actually happens to our bodies when we\u2019re watching scary movies \u2014 and why do some people actually enjoy it?\nSo why do some people enjoy what happens to our bodies during horror films?\nWhat we do know, however, is what happens to our bodies when we watch scary movies.\nYour Cortisol Levels RiseGoing to a horror film actually puts your body under quite a lot of psychological and physical stress.\nHorror films are often calibrated to keep your eyes moving, with lots of cut frames and frantic editing, to enhance the feeling of panic and claustrophobia.", "timescraped": 1513838727.044588, "category": {"words": 1137, "personal": 23, "thirdperson": 1, "condition": 0, "recovery": 0}}, "5c7efb5612b07fa2b3f41e7ea2706b53": {"title": "How To Help A Partner With Anxiety, Because Your Support Means Everything", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost/2016/9/13/e33be078-e970-47ce-80a2-ae14abca2e9b.jpg?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "text": "Anyone who has anxiety can agree on one thing: It's a bitch. Having panic attacks or living in constant fear isn't exactly fun, but those of us with anxiety know that we're not the only ones who suffer because of it \u2014 our family, friends, and significant others are also affected by the mess happening inside our heads. When you're dating someone with anxiety, knowing how to be a good support system is what will help you both.\n\nAnxiety comes in many different variations and affects up to 18 percent of the entire United States population, making it the most common mental disorder according to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America. My anxiety started cropping up when I was about 13. Throughout the years, I've tried countless things to try to get it to shut up, including professional therapy, more exercise, a healthier diet, and writing. Although all of my little tricks have helped in their own way, I still get the occasional panic attack, and I am pretty much in a constant state of worry over something.\n\nTo be honest (and, yes, a bit corny), what has helped me more than any therapy session is the support of the people I love. My family has stood by me from day one, but they're kind of obligated to love and support me, so, you know, they don't really count. Just kidding. But really, having a significant other who chooses to love you day after day and supports you through the battle with your own brain can help more than any medication on the market.\n\nYou're going to get frustrated, you're going to get confused, and you might even wonder if all of this is even worth it. But if you know how to help, you can make the battle a whole lot easier for both of you.\n\n1. Listen to them.\n\nMany people with anxiety have a million thoughts running through their heads at once, and many times, they're so jumbled that we don't even know why we're freaking out. Actually saying what's on our minds can be incredibly helpful, and if you're willing to provide an ear, it can make all the difference. We might ask for advice, but most of the time, we just need to know that someone is actually willing to try to understand what we're going through.\n\n2. If they attend therapy, offer to go with them.\n\nI don't even understand the reasons for half of my own panic attacks, so I could never expect someone who has never had experience with anxiety to understand them for me. Therapy helps us piece everything together and figure out how we can help ourselves, and if you come along with us, you can get a glimpse into what we're going through and what we need, too. Just offering to go will mean a lot to your partner, and if they specifically ask you to come along, take them up on it! You can learn a lot from a single session, and you'll be making major progress in your quest to be the Best Significant Other Ever. Keep in mind that some people may want to attend therapy alone, so make sure to respect your partner's wishes if they don't want you to tag along.\n\n3. Be patient.\n\nDeep down, we know that the reason you haven't answered our last nine calls is because it's 2 a.m. and you fell asleep and not because you're lying dead in a ditch somewhere. But that doesn't stop us from assuming the worst. In fact, a 2006 study by the Journal of Personality has proven that people with anxiety are more likely to jump to conclusions, and that even though they make correct assumptions more frequently than non-anxious people, they're less likely to perceive other people's emotions correctly. So if we constantly think that you're angry at us when you're really quite content, it probably not entirely our fault. Rather than getting angry with us, keep your voice low and provide that all-important listening ear. We know that our behavior isn't always healthy, and enabling us won't help, but working together to find a solution for next time is far more effective than telling us we're crazy.\n\n4. Support them through their treatment.\n\nDespite the fact that so many people suffer from anxiety, only about one-third actually go through treatment... and it's such a shame, because this mental illness is actually very treatable! Whether it\u2019s making sure we don\u2019t forget to take our meds, talking us through our breathing exercises during a panic attack, or helping us research some bizarre meditation ritual we found in the weird part of the internet, just knowing that you\u2019re willing to help us do anything possible to get better means the world to us. As long as it\u2019s not dangerous (leeches are generally on the \u201cnope\u201d end of the safety spectrum), helping us with whatever strategy we\u2019re working on can show us that we don\u2019t have to fight this battle alone.\n\n5. Don\u2019t trivialize what they\u2019re feeling.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t understand what we\u2019re going through, telling us that that the reason for our anxiety is \u201csilly\u201d or \u201cstupid\u201d is one of the worst things you can do. Most of us know that our fears are irrational or exaggerated, but that doesn\u2019t stop us from feeling them. Just as you expect others to sympathize with you when you\u2019re sad or happy, we feel better when you try to understand our anxiety rather than trivializing it. Of course, that\u2019s not to say you should tell us that we\u2019re correct in being terrified, but making us feel crazier than we already do is only going to make our anxiety worse.\n\n6. Be sensitive to their triggers.\n\nIf you know they get an instant panic attack at the sight of vomit, close the bathroom door when you need to puke. If the idea of death makes them hyperventilate, give them a heads up before they decide to get into Game of Thrones. Basically, don\u2019t be a jerk. The ADAA says that 8.7 percent of the US population suffers from a specific phobia, so if your partner suffers from any type of anxiety disorder, chances are good that they also have something specific that terrifies them. While you shouldn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re walking around eggshells around your partner, taking reasonable steps to make sure they\u2019re as relaxed as possible will keep both of you much happier.\n\n7. But don't be afraid to put your foot down somewhere\n\nThere's a fine line between being sensitive and babying us. Work with your partner and, if possible, their therapist to learn where that line is. Telling us that it's totally fine if we never leave the house again is obviously not going to benefit anyone, but neither will forcing us to progress much faster than we're ready to. It can be a tricky balance to achieve, but if you can pull it off, you'll be helping us on their way to recovery.\n\n8. Take care of your own mental health.\n\nWe know our anxiety can affect others, and if you're spending a lot of time around us, it's going to take its toll on you. Even if you feel perfectly fine now, the Mental Health Foundation reports that adults between the ages of 35 and 59 have higher levels of anxiety than any other age group. Thankfully, though, taking care of yourself now can help prevent you from feeling anxious down the road. Make sure you have effective ways to deal with your own stress. If you need some \"you\" time, take it. Find what helps you to feel better, and do it. If you're stressed while you're around us, we're going to be even more stressed, and it's going to create an unhealthy chain reaction that isn't good for either of us. We love you, and we want you to be happy, too!\n\n9. Be there for them.\n\nRight next to us, on Skype, or through telegram, anything you can do that lets us know you're here for us will instantly make us feel calmer. You're our Chosen One, and believe it or not, we like having you around. All the little things people do for each other in relationships, like \"good morning\" texts or dropping off some Chipotle, are twice as special for someone with anxiety because it lets us know that you still care.\n\n10. Ask them how you can help.\n\nAll of these tips have helped both me and many other people I know who suffer from anxiety, but (surprise!) everyone is different. Asking your partner what they need is the best way to ensure you're being the best support system you can be for them, and they'll appreciate whatever effort you make. They don't expect you to be perfect. They don't need a hero\u2014they can save themselves. But having an amazing sidekick certainly helps.\n\nImages: Franca Gimenez/Flickr; Giphy (10)", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/80916-how-to-help-a-partner-with-anxiety-because-your-support-means-everything", "summary": "When you're dating someone with anxiety, knowing how to be a good support system is what will help you both.\nYou're going to get frustrated, you're going to get confused, and you might even wonder if all of this is even worth it.\nBut if you know how to help, you can make the battle a whole lot easier for both of you.\nAll of these tips have helped both me and many other people I know who suffer from anxiety, but (surprise!)\nThey don't need a hero\u2014they can save themselves.", "timescraped": 1513838728.340008, "category": {"words": 1519, "personal": 72, "thirdperson": 27, "condition": 20, "recovery": 0}}, "c43b49281681c5873e8e413b95f9a79a": {"title": "I Got Lip Fillers For The First Time & This Is What Happened", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost/2016/9/13/75ac3c47-c73a-4c29-8cfd-20911d29348b.jpg?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "text": "For the past few years, I have been toying with the idea of getting lip fillers. It was something I had seen both celebrities and friends do (with some seemingly successful, lovely results) and always wanted to try the procedure out for myself and my thinning pout. After some careful research and a lot of self-reflection, I confidently decided to go for it.\n\nWhen it comes to talking about cosmetic surgery, some people practice \"my lips are sealed\" secrecy. Many don't want to expose themselves to the harsh judgement of society \u2014 a society that happens to be absolutely obsessed with cosmetic surgery while simultaneously being judgmental of it. Just take a look at all the backlash both Lana Del Rey and Kylie Jenner received after folks started accusing them of having undergone cosmetic treatment.\n\nDespite being scrutinized by the Internet, Jenner actually admitted to having lip fillers. And her admission sends an interesting message to the world: That no matter how attractive someone may be perceived as, everyone has their own insecurities. When it comes to the world of beauty, I also prefer the \"loud and proud\" method of sharing all of my personal experiences in the hopes that others may benefit from them.\n\nI'll be the first to admit that I've become a little insecure about my lips in the last few years. It wasn't that I ever thought my natural lips made me \"ugly\" or \"less attractive.\" On the contrary, I sort of liked them. They've been a crucial part of my face my entire life. A face I have grown to respect, admire, and love (just as I respect, admire, and love the rest of my body).\n\nBut as I began to age, I noticed they started to look, well, a little lackluster. A person's lips naturally get thinner and less plump as they age. And when I looked in the mirror one day and saw my aging lips smiling back at me (top lip, where are you?), I wont lie: A little part of me freaked out. I wanted my young, plumper pout back. Knowing that achieving this was possible with the help of lip fillers, I began to consider it very seriously. I've always been one of those women who has to at least try something to see if it's for me. So trying lip fillers for the first time was just like trying out any other beauty routine. It served the same purpose, after all: To help enhance one's physical appearance. Lip fillers consist of hyaluronic acid and naturally break down within the skin over a period of several months, eventually leaving no trace of the filler. So if they ended up being not for me, it was comforting to know that the fillers would fade over time and I wouldn't be stuck with them forever.\n\nAs someone who identifies as body positive, I've always been supportive of anyone who has wanted to get any procedure done, regardless of their reasons. There's no judgement on my end \u2014 just a wish of confidence and happiness. Whether you are getting Botox, learning how to contour, or simply going from blonde to brunette, I'm all for it. Part of being body positive is respecting other people's bodies and their decisions about those bodies.\n\nAfter speaking with friends who also had the procedure done and doing significant research, I knew what to expect, and I finally made the appointment to get my own lip fillers. I couldn't have been more excited. Despite the filler's temporary nature, the results are almost immediate, with a little bruising, tenderness, and swelling of the lips that might last a few days.\n\nIt was also absolutely crucial for me to have someone qualified do the procedure. Filler injections are offered at spas, beauty salons, and doctor offices alike, and some aestheticians may offer the procedure as well. You really want to make sure that the person performing the injections is qualified to do so and that you have access to medical help, should anything go wrong. Legal licensing for administering dermal fillers varies from state to state, so do your research when deciding on who you want to perform your injections, and make sure they are medically licensed to do so. I went to an actual cosmetic clinic, where I had a plastic surgeon consult with me beforehand, and a Certified Aesthetic Nurse Specialist (who had over 1,000 hours of experience) perform the actual procedure.\n\nMy lips right before getting the procedure.\n\nWhen I sat down to discuss what I was looking for, I explained that it was very important for me to still have my lips. I wanted to look like me. Giant lips are totally OK for some people if that's their preference, but I hoped for something a little more subtle \u2014 to enhance what was already there.\n\nWe decided to only use half a syringe (the nurse informed me that the average person uses a full one) of Teosyal in order to plump up my lips a little (without really changing their overall look), but other products such as JUV\u00c9DERM and Restylane are also popular. Before the nurse began, she first disinfected my lips, then rubbed a little topical numbing gel on them. After the numbing set in, she then injected mostly my top lip with a few injections (and yes, it hurts a little, but beauty is pain sometimes, after all), then passed me the mirror. The results were instant. When I looked at my reflection, I was absolutely ecstatic. Those were my lips, looking very much the same as they had before age took away some of my collagen.\n\nMy lips visibly swelled a little for three days after the procedure. They felt a little sore, but I wasn't in much discomfort for the most part. I had a bit of the duck lip thing going on while my lips were swollen, but that went down shortly thereafter too. You might also notice some little bumps inside your lips (you can feel them, but you shouldn't see them), which are just little bits of the fillers. I was told by the nurse that these bumps end up gradually dissolving after a month or so (depending on the person and how they metabolize the filler).\n\nIn total, the half syringe of Teosyal ran around $300, and will last six months (or more, depending on how fast your body metabolizes the filler). That's a cost of about $50/month, which is about the same price as getting fake nails put on, and is a lot cheaper than getting your hair done at most salons I've ever been to.\n\nAt the end of it all, I was extremely happy. The results were subtle, but also visible enough that I could tell something had changed. Most people didn't even notice when they saw me, although I did have a few friends comment on how \"lovely my lip gloss looked.\" When I finally revealed to my friends and family that I had it done, everyone was incredibly supportive.\n\nCosmetic procedures aren't for everyone, and I must take the opportunity to express that I don't believe anyone ever needs to have them done in order to be beautiful. You are always going to be beautiful, no matter what you do, or don't do.\n\nAccording to the JUV\u00c9DERM site, this procedure is relatively safe for most people (when administered by a qualified medical professional, of course), but there are always risks involved. Some people may have allergic reactions, the possibility of infection does exist, and on rare occasions, a blood vessel can become injected accidentally and cause complications. This is why it is so important to consult with a physician when you are considering having dermal fillers, and make sure the one administering it is highly trained and qualified.\n\nBut for those of you who have been wanting to try lip fillers (and are aware of the risks), I would highly suggest that you go for it. If all goes well, at the end of the day, they are temporary. So if they ends up not being for you, you aren't trapped. This was something that I had wanted to try for a while, and honestly, now I'm absolutely hooked. Getting lip fillers will likely be a regular part of my beauty routine and physical upkeep moving forward. I love the way they give me that little extra boost of confidence, while still looking like myself.\n\nAll in all, I give lip fillers my kiss of approval.\n\nWant more body positivity and empowerment?

Tears cascaded down my cheeks as I attempted to will myself out of the car and into the high school where I was tasked with teaching English Language Arts to 70 sophomores. I couldn't move, but time was running out. I had less than 30 minutes before I had to deliver a lesson, but I couldn't stop the tears. Another 10 minutes passed before I was able to make it to the back door of the school. Not long after that, I collapsed at an empty desk stationed in an unoccupied hallway.\n\nMy principal found me and coaxed me from the hallway desk to her office. Through tears, I told her I needed time away from the classroom to seek professional counseling. She understood, and told me of her own struggles with mental health. After I left her office, I scheduled an appointment with a therapist.\n\nThe therapist was supportive but blunt in our first meeting. She diagnosed me with situational depression and told me I would not achieve mental stability until I left the teaching profession. It was in that moment that I knew I couldn't return to the classroom. In a way, the decision was made for me: A few weeks ago, the school terminated me because I didn't submit Family Medical Leave Act paperwork in time.\n\nTeaching at a public school is so overwhelming that I was overwhelmed before the school year even began.\n\nThe hardest part of leaving the classroom was saying goodbye to the students I'd bonded with. I'd driven students home, advocated for them with other teachers, connected their families to resources, and even served as a summer mentor. Exiting the classroom meant leaving those students behind. It's still painful. But I've also never been more relieved.\n\nTeaching at a public school is so overwhelming that I was overwhelmed before the school year even began. I was dedicated and passionate, but not about the many organizational tasks I quickly learned were attached to teaching \u2014 planning, gathering data, grading, and the teaching and re-teaching of specific skills needed to pass standardized tests.\n\nI was so overwhelmed that I didn't even recognize when I started feeling depressed. It began with frequent trips to the staff bathroom to bawl, and evolved into crying the entire drive home. More than once, I actually had to pull over to let it out safely. I didn't know what had happened to my previously mostly-happy self. By the time I left the classroom, I was too depressed to get out of bed.\n\nWhat's worse is, my experience is a common one for educators \u2014 and it's what's leading to our shortage of teachers. According to Richard Ingersoll, a former public school teacher who's now a professor of education at the University of Pennsylvania, about one in 10 teachers quit the education profession by the end of their first year, and up to 50 percent of teachers leave within five years of starting their teaching career.\n\nA lot of teachers leave the profession for the same reasons I did, as reporter Liz Riggs found while interviewing former educators for her article in The Atlantic.\n\nIn theory, the classroom hours aren't bad and the summers are free. But, many young teachers soon realize they must do overwhelming amounts of after-hours work. They pour out emotional energy into their work, which breeds quick exhaustion.\n\nThis was true for me. I often worked from 7:30 a.m. until 10 p.m. \u2014 and I was still unable to complete all of the tasks I was assigned. Working extensive hours leaves little time for self-care or work-life balance. It was simply unsustainable.\n\nThe sacrifices required are pushing teachers out of the classroom, harming children, and leading to teaching shortages. Even Thomas Smith, a education professor formerly at Vanderbilt University, thinks the demands placed on teachers is often unreasonable and unsustainable.\n\nWhat people are asked to do is only the kind of thing that somebody can do for two or three years; you couldn't sustain that level of intensity throughout a career. [It's] the same way that people might think of investment banking. It's something that people do for a few years out of college, but if you want to have a family, or you want to have some leisure time, you know, how do you sustain that?\n\nIt is nearly impossible to sustain a life outside of teaching and expect to be successful in the classroom, and this fact is impacting how satisfied teachers are in their careers. A 2013 poll found that teacher satisfaction declined from 62 percent in 2008 to 39 percent in 2013 \u2014 in just five years, teacher satisfaction dropped 23 percent.\n\nAs a result, America is experiencing an extensive teacher shortage. The U.S. Department of Education projects that 2.2 million new teachers will be needed this decade, as half of America's three million teachers retire or depart from the classroom in the next five years. The schools most impacted by this shortage are those in highly concentrated areas of poverty. Incidentally, these facilities also happen to be responsible for educating the students who need the most support and love within the classroom.\n\nI was paid above the average starting teacher salary at $39,000, but it wasn't enough for me to live off of. I had to continue freelance writing (in addition to working odd weekend jobs) just to cover my rent and credit card bills.\n\nOffering extensive and effective training for all new teachers is a great place to start remedying these troubling statistics. I taught for nine months before I was trained \u2014 and that training focused more on the ins-and-outs of the network I was teaching in and how to make students comply with instructions than it did on molding me into a more effective educator.\n\nTeachers must also be paid well if we want to see higher retention rates. In the United States, the average teacher's starting salary was $36,141 in the 2012-13 year. And while I was paid above the average starting teacher salary at $39,000, it wasn't enough for me to live off of. I had to continue freelance writing (in addition to working odd weekend jobs) just to cover my rent and credit card bills. Offering higher salaries to teachers will attract more college students to the education profession.\n\nMost importantly, teachers need support. I was frequently being evaluated for raises, but I wasn't being offered the support I needed to become a more effective educator. Had an administrator asked me how I was doing, it could have been the difference between my leaving the education profession or remaining in the classroom. Statistics show I'm not the only educator who feels this way: Retention is higher when teachers have mentors and regular communication with administrators and veteran teachers.\n\nUnless there are major reforms, I have no intention of returning to the classroom. Students deserve the best teachers, and the best teachers are stable.", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/121971-teaching-gave-me-a-nervous-breakdown-and-i-know-im-not-alone", "summary": "She diagnosed me with situational depression and told me I would not achieve mental stability until I left the teaching profession.\nI was paid above the average starting teacher salary at $39,000, but it wasn't enough for me to live off of.\nIn the United States, the average teacher's starting salary was $36,141 in the 2012-13 year.\nAnd while I was paid above the average starting teacher salary at $39,000, it wasn't enough for me to live off of.\nOffering higher salaries to teachers will attract more college students to the education profession.", "timescraped": 1513838730.829615, "category": {"words": 1179, "personal": 60, "thirdperson": 15, "condition": 4, "recovery": 0}}, "8f793215ad3411b5270c6a02d8357bca": {"title": "7 Weird Ways Anxiety Can Affect Your Body Positivity & How To Fix It", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost/2016/9/13/9823c6f8-9f0b-433e-92ee-621206553c68.jpg?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "text": "Anxiety is a bully. I mean, there are so many ways anxiety wrecks body positivity that it makes my head spin. Well, it was already spinning from anxiety, but some of those thoughts were totally about my body being wrong. Because anxiety gives zero f*cks about how I'm feeling, especially when I'm feeling beautiful. Instead, it lurks in the background like a creepy predator, waiting for a positive thought to emerge so it can crush it.\n\nOK, that's a little dramatic, but it totally feels like that sometimes. According to research published in Clinical Psychology Review, social anxiety disorder almost always overlaps with some other type of anxiety, such as body dysmorphic disorder, which is a severely negative body image. In other words, science has basically proven that anxiety and body positivity are frenemies. So if you suffer from anxiety and also struggle with poor self image or anti-body pos thoughts, you're not alone. One often leads to the other. So what can you do?\n\nAs an anxiety sufferer myself, and as a person who helped couples overcome their issues as a Domestic Violence Victim Advocate and Planned Parenthood Responsible Sexuality Educator, I've got some tips. First you have to identify the ways your brain is bullying you. Once you do that, you can work on deconstructing and reversing those messages, whether in your journal or in your therapist's office.\n\n1. It Doesn't Accept Compliments Well\n\nThe anxiety bully is never more ready to pounce then when someone is digging your look. In fact, anxiety is so stealthy, you probably just automatically say dismissive or negative things about yourself whenever someone compliments you, like it's a reflex. This inability to accept compliment is like a wall that keeps body positivity out.\n\nWhat To Do: When someone pays you a compliment, just say \"thank you\" according to etiquette expert Jacqueline Whitmore, in an article for the Huffington Post. This takes some practice, and you'll want to play off the compliment, but don't let yourself. Just own it.\n\n2. It Doubts Your Taste In Everything\n\nAs if making you feel bad about the way you look wasn't bad enough, anxiety can make you worry about your taste. It can make you worry that your clothes are all wrong. Your lipstick is the wrong shade. Your boots are not trendy enough. Sometimes it stops you from buying things you really like. Sometimes it doesn't let you buy anything because it doesn't let you like anything.\n\nWhat To Do: Go shopping with a friend who has really good taste. If you can't trust yourself, you can trust your friend. Do this enough, and you might even start to trust yourself to buy things that make you look and feel good.\n\n3. It Makes You Worry What Others Think\n\nThis is really the heart of it all. It's weird because sometimes you can love your body, and really be feeling yourself, but you're still wreck with anxiety over whether other people will feel the same. This worry can be so strong it's overwhelming.These are called self-esteem attacks, similar to panic attacks, according to the Self-Esteem Institute, but they could also be panic attack related, depending on your particular anxiety. They've been known to have people running to the bathroom to take off a red lipstick or change clothes because they just couldn't handle the worry.\n\nWhat To Do: Remember that people aren't usually thinking about you, and if they do, it's usually for just a few seconds. Also remind yourself that if someone doesn't like the way you look, they're not likely to tell you to your face, and their opinion is just one of many. Reassure yourself that you have an amazing bod, and that you are also so much more than your appearance.\n\n4. It Makes You Believe Your Body Is Wrong\n\nBelieving your body is wrong is no joke. Negative body image can be so serious that, in addition to anxiety, it's also linked to depression and suicidal thoughts, especially in adolescents, according to Science Daily. Those thoughts can keep you from doing things you want to do, meeting people, applying for jobs, and spending time with those you care about. It can make you think horrific thoughts, like wishing you could take scissors to your stomach, or unzip your skin and step out of it.\n\nWhat To Do: Tell yourself that there's no such thing as a \"wrong\" or even a \"right\" body. Those are all constructs human invented. Also, remind yourself that it's insulting to judge you based on one aspect of your being, as if the size of your thighs is the whole of your worth. Get feisty if you have to!\n\n5. It Tells You You're Too Fat\n\nWhen you get dressed in the morning, anxiety can tell you that you're too fat to wear leggings (as if that's even possible). It can tell you you need to lose weight, you need to work out, you need to eat less, you look like a bloated manatee. And while \"bloated manatee\" may sound like a comical exaggeration, it's really not. These types of thoughts, rooted in anxiety, often lead to deadly eating and exercise disorders.\n\nWhat To Do: Pick out some outfit combinations when you're feeling good. Take pics of them or write them down. When you're feeling bad, go to one of these looks and remind yourself that you know it's a winner, and that your anxiety brain is trying to bully you.\n\n6. It Tells You You're Not Good Enough\n\nThis is a tricky one, because anxiety tells you both that you're not good enough and that you don't deserve to be good enough. It tells you that you don't deserve to treat yourself to a fancy designer bag, both because you're not stylish enough to carry it off, and because it would be like putting a ribbon on a toilet. It stops you from going to parties because you don't want to be the worst-dressed person there. When you have that great outfit, it tells you not to go because everyone will see through you.\n\nWhat To Do: This one's tough and involves some real, deep self-esteem work. In the meantime, what you can do is to try minimize those feelings by telling yourself that it's just your anxiety, then walking yourself through the worst-case scenario. Odds are, the worst thing that could happen is probably not that bad, and totally something you could deal with.\n\n7. It Makes You Judge Others\n\nSometimes we do some terrible things to make ourselves feel good. We're human. Often, those things include judging others. As our body anxiety drives us into an image-obsessed place, we may pick apart every single person we see. We do it on social media, too. Thoughts like \"omg, those eyebrows, seriously?\" and \"what is that horrific dress?\" may be satisfying or even funny in passing, but all you're doing is contributing to a culture that makes you feel bad, too.\n\nWhat To Do: Practice finding only things to compliment in people you see. Whenever you catch yourself judging or snarking, call yourself out and stop.\n\nIt might take the help of a professional therapist or counselor to quiet the anxiety bully, and it's work you have to do all day, every day, but it's totally worth it to get to the truth of how beautiful and amazing you truly all. We all are.\n\nImages: Pexels; Giphy (7)", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/137525-7-weird-ways-anxiety-can-affect-your-body-positivity-how-to-fix-it", "summary": "I mean, there are so many ways anxiety wrecks body positivity that it makes my head spin.\nWell, it was already spinning from anxiety, but some of those thoughts were totally about my body being wrong.\nIn other words, science has basically proven that anxiety and body positivity are frenemies.\nSo if you suffer from anxiety and also struggle with poor self image or anti-body pos thoughts, you're not alone.\nAs our body anxiety drives us into an image-obsessed place, we may pick apart every single person we see.", "timescraped": 1513838710.138377, "category": {"words": 1263, "personal": 12, "thirdperson": 9, "condition": 17, "recovery": 0}}, "ec645b04e944783ca103b63b9726b21c": {"title": "15 People Share How They Cope With Anxiety", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/2017/2/28/0968de00-670f-4516-81fd-ff48561c04a2.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "text": "Whether your anxiety is typically tied to stressful life events, (like wedding planning and/or starting a new job) or it\u2019s a near-constant part of your daily life, anxiety is something nearly everyone struggles with. In fact, anxiety is the most common mental illness in the U.S., affecting an estimated 40 million adults. Further, although it\u2019s true that stress and anxiety aren\u2019t the same thing, dealing with chronic stress can be just as difficult as coping with anxiety. Anxiety can mess with everything from your sex life to your vision, and chronic stress can lead to burnout at best and depression at worst. So while it\u2019s totally OK (normal, even) to be an openly anxious person, learning how to cope with anxiety is crucial to both your mental and physical health.\n\nFortunately, talking about mental health has become slightly less taboo in recent years. Bustle is just one of many sites that abounds with well-researched articles detailing how to define, diagnose, and treat anxiety disorders. (Hell, I\u2019ve written many of them.) Twitter continues to destigmatize mental illness with their extensive list of mental health hashtags, too. Even rappers, like Kid Cudi and DMX, have used their respective platforms to talk about mental health.\n\nClearly, anxiety is incredibly common, and there's a lot we could learn from each other's experiences managing it \u2014 so I asked 15 ordinary people how they cope with their anxiety. Their answers are both encouraging and genuinely helpful, so if you struggle with anxiety, then read on. This is how 15 people handle their anxiety.\n\nIsabelle, 24\n\n\"To deal with my anxiety, I hold my dog Moose. I like to keep him clean for these moments, of course, so I can bury my face in his fur. He is always warm and will grunt at me while I hug him, and [he will] give me soft kisses on my forehead and hands. While I hold Moose, I try to make my breathing match his so I will calm down. Thinking of warm cuddles from Moose helps to calm me down if I am in an unfortunately public area at the time of sudden anxiety.\n\nI highly recommend an animal for people with anxiety. Not everyone can drink and/or smoke a little bowl of weed when anxiety hits. For people whose anxiety eases with touch, animals should be a first choice.\"\n\nCasey, 31\n\n\"I use writing and music to cope with my anxiety. I also role play with friends. It helps me get away from this world and kind of live a different life \u2014 like a reader does when they become engrossed in a book. I am 31 and have used these methods since I was a kid. I also take medicine too, when the attacks are really severe.\"\n\nSofia, 24\n\n\"I like to go somewhere quiet, close my eyes, and breathe deep. As I breathe, I like to relax my muscles beginning with my chest, stomach, and back, and moving to my limbs. It literally takes me 30 seconds, but it's like taking a nap.\"\n\nNicole, 26\n\n\"I make slime!!! Textures and colors help \u2014 crochet and crafts...reading is awesome too.\"\n\nCheryl, 57\n\n\"I practice deep yogic breathing, (of which there are many methods) as well as meditation, which is really awesome. Along with these, I try to incorporate visualization techniques, re-centering/refocusing on the at-hand moment \u2014 and I have my own personal mantra that I say over and over while doing these, whether it is the controlled breathing or meditating.\"\n\nAmanda, 38\n\n\"I cope with my anxiety by crocheting. There have been a ton of studies on how knitting and crochet can help with anxiety ... Honestly though, there is something therapeutic in the rhythm of the stitching and the feel of the yarn in your hand. People may think I'm crazy for it \u2014 but hey, I already have that label, so whatever. The repetitiveness allows your mind to concentrate on the project and not your surroundings. Then there is the satisfaction of the completed project and the compliments you get when you show off your work. You can also find tons of tutorial videos on YouTube. The Crochet Crowd has my favorite videos.\"\n\nEllie, 28\n\n\"For a quick fix, I deep breathe and/or massage my neck or temples. If I have the time, being creative really reduces anxiety for me: painting or drawing. Also, regularly-scheduled massages help to reduce my stress and anxiety by giving me a planned time for relaxation and meditation, as well as getting those tense muscles relaxed.\"\n\nJo, 24\n\n\"I cope with my anxiety mostly through physical activity. I kickbox at least twice a week and do yoga when I can. The aggressiveness of kickboxing helps me work out a lot of that anxious energy, and I notice a huge difference in my nervousness and my sleep if I go a week without kickboxing at all. I also do my best to refrain from watching or listening to anything news-related on the weekends, since that's a huge trigger for my anxiety right now. Even when my boyfriend says, 'hey can we turn on the news?' while we're making breakfast on a weekend, I try to nicely explain to him that that's a hard boundary for me. It really helps me wind down and maintain some distance from work (which involves the news and politics).\n\nLastly, I make sure that I have time to do really simple stuff that makes me happy. My recent thing has been coloring and watching cooking shows. It seems silly, but it allows me to totally shut off my brain and keeps my hands busy. I try to give myself at least one or two nights a week where I'm totally alone so that I can do something like that and only worry about myself.\"\n\nGrace, 25\n\n\"When I am anxious, I try to remember that it is only a feeling and that I am safe. I also find that being honest with those close to me helps. Sometimes saying it helps me to remember that the anxiety is just a symptom, not reality. It doesn't make the feeling go away, but it helps me power through. There is always an end. And of course, when I just can't bring myself to talk about it, there is always my dog.\"\n\nSydney, 28\n\n\"I take prescription medication for anxiety/mood. It's called Wellbutrin. I like it pretty well. I took Lexapro...for anxiety when it was especially bad. It worked well at first, but ended up being a total damper on my libido, so I stopped taking it. After a few months on nothing, I switched to Wellbutrin. Besides that, I see a LCSW once a month to chat.\"\n\nPaul, 56\n\n\"I throw myself into a big project that lasts a couple of days. That way, I can pray and think and meditate and be alone. Usually, by the end of the project I figure out how to handle whatever I'm anxious about. Plus, I have an accomplishment to feel good about.\"\n\nMatthew, 28\n\n\"I never really had anxiety problems until I had my [car] wreck. At that point, I suddenly started experiencing anxiety attacks. The only thing that really helped at that time was Ativan and sleep. Now I notice that I don't handle stress nearly as well as I used to, and I occasionally need to remove myself from situations that make me anxious until I can start breathing more normally again.\n\nWhen I'm feeling stressed now, I tend to turn to entertainment for a distraction. Whether it's a movie, a book, or a fun game, media can provide escapism from whatever is triggering my stress. Sometimes, though, stress becomes full-blown anxiety. When that happens, I'm thankful for my Apple Watch, which has a 'Breathe' app that reminds me to take a 30-second or one minute break each hour and just focus on my breathing.\"\n\nRebecca, 28\n\n\"This is going to sound strange, but the thing that works best to pull me out of a panic attack is to have someone rub my feet. I think something about the physical contact helps to ground me in reality. Unfortunately, it doesn't help if I rub my own feet. When I'm alone and dealing with anxiety, I like to snuggle with my dogs. I like to make sure I have a paper bag nearby if I start hyperventilating. Trying to breath with the rhythm of a slow song can help too.\"\n\nDonna, 61\n\n\"When I'm anxious and I can't sleep, I try relaxation techniques, like deep breathing. I also meditate on Jesus and pray. It's really not even about repeating scriptures at that point, it's about a relationship that brings me comfort and peace.\"\n\nLaura, 28\n\n\"I list the most dangerous chemicals on earth and what they do. This makes me think and distracts my brain from freaking out. I remind myself that I am still breathing right now, and that's all that I need to do. It's OK if I vomit or if I need to find a safe place to sit on the floor for awhile. (Most establishments are totally cool to find one for you if you need one.) I use every anxiety attack as a stepping stone to get past the current one. I remember, I have felt this way before and I am still breathing.

In fact, along with being open about certain health conditions, there have been many celebs who have been open about struggles with anxiety, specifically.\n\nThinking of a celebrity or anyone in the public eye with anxiety seems almost like an impossibility. How could these people who are so open with their lives be struggling with shyness or even nearly crippling anxiety? This only proves how different each case of anxiety truly is. Some people pursue acting or the arts as a way to cope with their anxious thoughts and behaviors, as the ultimate therapy.

Emma Stone\n\nANNE-CHRISTINE POUJOULAT/AFP/Getty Images\n\nEmma Stone always shines in her comedic roles, but she told Vogue in 2012 how she was a \"very anxious kid.\" She said, \u201cI was just kind of immobilized by it. I didn\u2019t want to go to my friends\u2019 houses or hang out with anybody, and nobody really understood.\u201d She also explained in the profile that she used acting and comedy as her therapy, saying, \u201cComedy was my sport. It taught me how to roll with the punches. Failure is the exact same as success when it comes to comedy because it just keeps coming. It never stops.\u201d\n\n2. Amanda Seyfried\n\nJun Sato/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nIn 2015, Seyfried also told Vogue about her bouts of anxiety and fear of public speaking, which resulted in her once being drunk while appearing on The Late Show. She said, \"I have a lot of anxiety that I\u2019ve been struggling with my whole life... So I have been working through it. I\u2019m terrified, but this is exactly what I wanted.\u201d\n\n3. Sarah Silverman\n\nChristopher Polk/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nComedian Silverman had a lead dramatic role in I Smile Back , as a character that hit close to home and made her reveal her struggles with depression and anxiety. She opened up to Glamour , saying,\n\nPeople use \"panic attack\" very casually out here in Los Angeles, but I don't think most of them really know what it is. Every breath is labored. You are dying. You are going to die. It's terrifying. And then when the attack is over, the depression is still there. Once, my stepdad asked me, \"What does it feel like?\" And I said, \"It feels like I'm desperately homesick, but I'm home.\"\n\n4. Lena Dunham\n\nDunham has projected many of her own personality traits onto her Girls character Hannah Horvath, including her struggles with anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder. Dunham opened up in her book, Not That Kind of Girl , by writing, \"I have only the vaguest memory of a life before fear. Every morning when I wake up there is one blissful second before I look around the room and remember my daily terrors.\" It is still something she has every day, but she has found ways to cope.\n\n5. Clay Aiken\n\nJeffrey A. Camarati/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nClay Aiken has admitted that he had a few issues with panic attacks when he was younger, but his social anxiety sky-rocketed after his stint on American Idol. He told ABC News , \"When I am in the room, the walls are closing in on me and my heart races, and I didn't understand it. I would look back and say, 'Why are your, why are your palms sweaty? What's the problem?' ... I've probably been bullied on a far larger scale since I've done this ['American Idol.']\"\n\n6. Colton Haynes\n\nFrazer Harrison/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nLast December, actor Colton Haynes shocked many when he revealed a very intense battle with social anxiety in a series of tweets. After posting a link to a medical study on anxiety, he said,\n\nAnxiety had put me in the hospital a countless amount of times. Whether it be fainting, hyperventilating, or seizures...I've been through it \u2014 (@coltonlhaynes) #\n\nI've quite jobs because of anxiety, flaked on social events, family gatherings, birthdays, important movie/work tests. Its a serious problem \u2014 (@coltonlhaynes) #\n\nLove those suffering. Anxiety has caused me to be extremely agoraphobic & livin in constant fear of leavin my house at times. Ur not alone. \u2014 (@coltonlhaynes) #\n\n7. Mara Wilson\n\nProject UROK on YouTube\n\nMara Wilson opened up about her anxiety in a video for Project UROK. UROK is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to \"create meaningful videos for teenagers struggling with mental health issues.\" In the video, Wilson confesses, \"I wish somebody had told me that it's OK to be anxious, that you don't have to fight it... It's OK to be depressed.\"\n\n8. Olivia Munn\n\nFrazer Harrison/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nMunn's social anxiety has manifested itself in the impulse disorder of trichotillomania, which causes people to pull out their hair. Munn shared with NY Daily News , \u201cI don\u2019t bite my nails, but I rip out my eyelashes. It doesn\u2019t hurt, but it\u2019s really annoying. Every time I run out of the house, I have to stop and pick up a whole set of fake eyelashes.\u201d\n\n9. Adele\n\nSascha Steinbach/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nAdele seems like she's always at ease and at home on the stage, but that couldn't be further from the truth. Early in her career, Adele confessed to Rolling Stone about how her anxiety affected her performances. She said,\n\nI\u2019m scared of audiences. One show in Amsterdam I was so nervous, I escaped out the fire exit. I\u2019ve thrown up a couple of times. Once in Brussels, I projectile vomited on someone. I just gotta bear it.

Because of this, I\u2019ve been cataloguing all the little things that help me feel less anxious for years, despite the fact that I didn\u2019t fully accept my anxiety issues until recently. And I have to say, some of my coping mechanisms have been pretty reliable.\n\nLike the millions of other Americans who struggle with anxiety, (anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the U.S., affecting nearly 20 percent of the population) I\u2019m no stranger to anxiety attacks. I had my first one when I was seven, and I\u2019ve had many more since then \u2014 so a few months ago, I decided it was about time I saw someone about it. It was an important step for me, because it meant I was finally taking my mental health seriously \u2014 but the medication I was prescribed didn\u2019t help me much. Yes, it relieved the tightness in my chest and kept me from crying in public, but it also left me feeling exhausted and irritable.\n\nSo, for the time being, I\u2019m trying to learn how to manage my anxiety without medication. It\u2019s hard work, but it\u2019s definitely worth it. Here are 14 little things that help me when I'm feeling anxious. I hope they might help you too.\n\n1. Chewing Gum\n\n[Embed]\n\nA while back, I was perusing Bustle's app for tips on how to improve your focus, and one of the articles I came across listed \"chew gum\" as a focusing hack. So before I sat down to write my next article, I bought some chewing gum, and I chewed the hell out of it. Guess what? It worked!\n\nBut not only did chewing gum significantly improve my ability to focus on my assignment, it cut down on my anxiety, too. I'm not entirely sure why this is, but I'm not the first person to use chewing gum to ease anxiety. Personally, I think this anti-anxiety hack works for me because chewing gum allows me to get rid of some of my nervous energy. All I know for certain, though, is this: chewing gum helps me feel less anxious. So nowadays, anytime I'm feeling anxious, I pop a piece of gum in my mouth. And when I run out of the stuff, I stock back up ASAP.\n\n2. Eating With My Hands\n\n[Embed]\n\nInterestingly, I've actually found that eating sans utensils is a simple way for me to feel more grounded \u2014 and finding grounding strategies that work is an important part of managing anxiety and panic disorders. I mean, I don't eat with my hands for every single meal, because soup. Eating with my hands has proven to be an effective grounding strategy for me, though, so I do it whenever I can. This particular method of munching engages all of my senses, and it brings me back to the present when I start to freak out about one of my past actions or an upcoming event.\n\n3. Playing With Animals\n\n[Embed]\n\nPlaying with my cats isn't typically enough to bring me out of an anxiety attack, because those things can get pretty rough. When it comes to dealing with my everyday anxiety issues, though, Madeline and Smuggz are basically my fluffy, little saviors. Not only do they leave me feeling happier and more calm, parenting them forces me to think of someone else's needs. No matter what's going on with me, my kitties need to be brushed, fed, watered, and cuddled on a daily basis \u2014 and their presence in my house means I'm never really alone. As an added bonus, cat purrs literally strengthen bones, and research shows that cat owners have fewer strokes, too.\n\nI know I can always also count on friendly dogs to help me gain control when I start to feel anxious. Sometimes, when I'm feeling too anxious to sit still but I don't want to bail on hanging out, I just ask if I can take my buddies' dogs for a quick walk. It takes maybe 15 minutes, and everyone wins.\n\n4. Going For A Walk By Myself\n\n[Embed]\n\nFew things help me manage my anxiety better than exercise, and walking is the easiest exercise out there. Although I always enjoy walking with the people I like, (especially now that Pokemon GO exists) for me, walking alone is ideal when I'm trying to combat anxiousness. Solo strolls allow me to walk at my natural pace, (which is Gilmore-level fast) while simultaneously working in some meditation and positive self-talk. Plus, the mental and physical health benefits of walking are extensive.\n\n5. Taking A Few Slow, Deep Breaths\n\n[Embed]\n\nIt's a cliche for a reason. Anytime I'm driving alone, I take advantage of that privacy by practicing some deep breathing. If I'm hanging out with friends, I make double use of my solo bathroom trips to sneak in some more deep breathing. When I'm writing an article and I feel so anxious that I can hardly sit still, I close my eyes, and take five deep breaths. I try to do this whether I'm feeling anxious or not, though, because part of managing anxiety naturally is taking preventative measures to stay calm.\n\n6. Standing And/Or Sitting Up Straight\n\n[Embed]\n\nRecently, my dude told me, \"you know you slouch a lot.\" I'm sensitive as hell, so it kind of hurt my feelings, but he was right. Since then, I've made more of an effort to stand and sit up straight, and it's helped with my anxiety quite a bit. Considering that poor posture can mess with your breathing, your heart rate, your ability to focus, and your self esteem, it's really no wonder that this works for me.\n\n7. Stretching\n\n[Embed]\n\nWhether I'm writing in a cafe, hanging out with friends, chilling with my fella, or watching Stranger Things, stretching has proved to be a super effective way for me to control my anxiety. Sometimes, I'll stop, drop, and yoga when I feel anxiety bubbling up. When I'm out and don't feel like performing a wheel pose in public, I just touch my toes and/or do some arm stretches instead.\n\n8. Cleaning\n\n[Embed]\n\nOK, so I don't get jazzed about cleaning my toilet or anything, but I've been cleaning to quiet my anxiety since I was a kid. To be clear, other people's messes don't bug me that much \u2014 but, personally, I couldn't live in a messy house without feeling anxious all the time. So whether it's my whole kitchen or just my bedroom, I try to clean something every day. It usually doubles as a time of meditation for me, too, and meditative actions are great for anxiety.\n\n9. Orgasming\n\n[Embed]\n\nIt's literally a scientific fact that climaxing reduces stress. Because it's also really fun, I try to make it happen every day. Luckily, my dude is pretty much always down to go down, so that helps. When we can't fit sex into our day, though, I just bust out my Foxy Toyfriend. Either way, in my experience, more orgasms = less anxiety.\n\n10. Socializing\n\n[Embed]\n\nI value my alone time, but too much of it can make my anxiety way worse. So when I start to feel out-of-control anxious, I always try to meet up with, or call, one of my friends. Being around the people I love, or even just hearing their voice, helps me feel safe \u2014 and it gives me an opportunity to listen to someone else's concerns instead of obsessing over my own.\n\n11. Having A Cup Of Peppermint Tea\n\n[Embed]\n\nI love coffee, but if I go over two cups a day, I'm going to pay for it in anxiety symptoms. So when I need to soothe myself, but I've had my two cups of java already, I brew a cup of peppermint tea. Not only does the tea itself help calm my anxiety symptoms, the whole tea-making ritual calms me down, too; it forces me to focus on something besides the tightness in my chest and the string of anxious thoughts in my head.\n\n12. Writing\n\n[Embed]\n\nWeirdly enough, my anxiety can make it really difficult for me to write sometimes \u2014 but when I manage to power through my anxiousness and write an article anyway, it always chills me out. Keeping a journal helps, too \u2014 because there's something about writing down all of my worries, and then reading them back to myself, that makes them feel a little bit less dire.\n\n13. Practicing Self-Care\n\n[Embed]\n\nI've always been one of those people who likes to groom, but I've only recently realized why that it is. Sticking to a self-care routine helps me manage my anxiety for so many reasons. If I'm taking good care of my body, that's one less thing to worry about it. Plus, self-care is typically a solitary thing, and some alone time is crucial for everyone. On top of all that, making time for self-care boosts my self-esteem \u2014 because all of those coconut oil hair treatments leave me feeling (and, dare I say, looking) like a hippie goddess.\n\n14. Putting My Phone Away\n\n[Embed]\n\nI used to keep my phone turned up and by my side pretty much constantly, and that habit didn't do my anxiety any favors. Now, if I'm at a friends house, I usually set my phone on one of their counter tops and ignore the sh*t out of it. I try not to check Facebook more than three times a day, either. And if it's after 6 p.m., I don't stress out too hard about missing work emails. Of course, this doesn't mean I don't Instagram on the daily, and I still take my phone everywhere I go, too. I'm just not quite as addicted to it anymore \u2014 and it's made a huge difference in my mental health.\n\nImages: lizzyenochs/Instagram, Giphy/(8)", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/175017-14-little-things-that-help-me-when-im-feeling-anxious", "summary": "Here are 14 little things that help me when I'm feeling anxious.\nI'm not entirely sure why this is, but I'm not the first person to use chewing gum to ease anxiety.\nSo nowadays, anytime I'm feeling anxious, I pop a piece of gum in my mouth.\nI know I can always also count on friendly dogs to help me gain control when I start to feel anxious.\nI try to do this whether I'm feeling anxious or not, though, because part of managing anxiety naturally is taking preventative measures to stay calm.", "timescraped": 1513838714.192647, "category": {"words": 1680, "personal": 114, "thirdperson": 9, "condition": 29, "recovery": 0}}, "bf215e50c90831d46f40abaccd41e650": {"title": "11 Signs Your Everyday Worrying Is Actually Normal & Not An Anxiety Disorder", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/uploads/image/2017/8/20/47cb618b-4f43-4025-97fb-8a7e2197bc4b-pexels-photo-415484.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "text": "Even if you feel like the happiness person in the world, you're bound to experience some anxiety, but not every situation where you have anxiety means you have a disorder. If you get anxious occasionally, but it doesn't greatly impede on your life, then you are likely showing signs that your anxiety is actually normal. Sometimes life throws us curveballs, and we have to deal with them emotionally; other times, we are simply hungry or tired and can't cope with things like we normally would. Either way, some anxiety is bound to happen, and there's no cause to worry when you start to experience the uncomfortable feeling.\n\n\"Anxiety, the feeling, is a normal reaction to stress, and can actually be beneficial in some situations,\" says Shanthi Mogali, MD, Director of Psychiatry at Mountainside Treatment Center, over email. \"It drives the fight or flight response and is our body\u2019s natural way of defending itself in a harmful situations. Usual or normal anxiety occurs in response to a stressor of some sort. Anxiety can rise from midterms/finals for students, a breakup with a girlfriend or boyfriend, having a fight with a peer, applying for a new job, or general peer pressure, etc.\"\n\nIf you experience some anxiety, but you're not sure if it's a greater disorder or not, pay attention to these 11 signs that your anxiety is normal. You should also always talk to your doctor if you feel like your anxiety is too much.\n\n1 It's Usually Triggered By Clear Stressor Pexels \"You typically do not experience anxiety or notice you are anxious unless there is a life event that is coming up or something in your life is changing,\" says psychotherapist Angela Ficken over email. \"That can be a key way to acknowledge that the event is the trigger to your anxiety and once it\u2019s over, anxiety will subside.\"\n\n2 It Doesn't Interfere With Your Daily Functioning Pexels Anxiety about a stressor can take over your mind for a certain amount of time, but it won't interfere with your overall wellbeing or daily functioning. \"You are able to get your work done, stay in contact with your friends and loved ones, and you also take care of yourself, such as exercising or listening to a fun podcast,\" says Ficken.\n\n3 It Eventually Goes Away Pexels Because normal anxiety is the result of a stressor, it ultimately goes away or subsides. \"If an individual\u2019s level of anxiety goes away after a triggering event is over, that is usually an indicator that the feelings of anxiety are a normal psychological response,\" says Dr. Sal Raichbach PsyD, LCSW of Ambrosia Treatment Center, over email.\n\n4 It Motivates You Pexels \"Without some degree of anxiety, motivation for certain activities can be difficult,\" says psychotherapist Jon Belford, PsyD over email. \"Anxiety by nature is stimulating and can drive us to achieve our goals, meet deadlines, and stay on top of necessary tasks.\" Anxiety is beyond a healthy range when it causes us to avoid activities or situations, impairs functioning or causes undue discomfort without driving behaviors towards resolving a particular issue.\n\n5 It Focuses On Things You Can Control Pexels Anxiety is adaptive when focused on areas where we have a sense of agency and can positively impact an anticipated outcome. \"Excessive worry about things we can\u2019t control is ultimately wasted energy and reinforces negative thinking,\" says Belford. \"It is normal to have some degree of worry about dire situations such as disasters or illness, but ultimately we should be able to compartmentalize these concerns, take appropriate precautions, move forward, and enjoy the moment.\"\n\n6 There Are No Other Symptoms Pexels Symptoms of anxiety disorders aren\u2019t limited to restless feelings and uneasiness. \"Often individuals who suffer from anxiety disorders display other symptoms such as nausea, increased heart rate, and difficulty concentrating when their anxiety is triggered,\" says Raichbach.\n\n7 It Doesn't Get Worse In Social Situations Pexels \"People with anxiety disorders often avoid social situations because they constantly fear being judged or embarrassed,\" says Raicbach. \"For some, the anticipation of social interactions is enough to worsen symptoms.\"\n\n8 It Happens In New Situations Pexels New situations cause anxiety because as it helps your brain and body stay alert to the new experience. \"That flutter in your heart on a first date means you'll be able to recall more of it, or that twinge of anxiety as you're walking down an alley makes you more aware of small noises around you,\" says Torgerson.\n\n9 You Are Able To Manage It Pexels If you feel able to manage and lower your level of anxiety, that is within the \"normal\" realm. \"Many people with an anxiety disorder feel unable to control their spikes in anxiety or have difficulty predicting when their next bout of anxiety is going to arrive,\" says Kelsey Torgerson, MSW, LCSW over email.\n\n10 It's Only Once Or Twice A Week Pexels There is no specific \"normal\" amount of time to experience anxiety, but if you only experience anxiety once or twice a week, it's probably not cause for concern. \"People who suffer from anxiety often experience it more days than not, even multiple times a day, for months at a time,\" says Torgerson.", "url":

Habits That Can Make Your Anxiety Worse Without Realizing It", "image":

that the feeling can creep up at any moment. Although you can't always stop it when the sensation strikes, you can try to eliminate any habits that can make your anxiety worse. Unfortunately, you can't avoid all situations that make you feel uncomfortable, but a number of everyday habits can worsen your anxiety longterm, and you can work to avoid these.\n\n\"Feeling less anxious is all about maintaining lower levels of cortisol in our system,\" says Jennifer Weaver, LMHC, CRC over email. \"Sometimes, certain events (i.e., making a major presentation at work) will spike our cortisol and leave us with anxiety leading up to the event and residual anxiety after. Other times, though, we slowly build up cortisol throughout our day.\"\n\nAnxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the United States, with over 40 million people affected, according to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA). Finding ways to treat anxiety is important, and adapting healthy habits can help you naturally fight off those negative side effects. Even if you don't have a full-blown anxiety disorder, avoiding these activities can help keep your stress levels and mood in check.\n\nIf you want to reduce your anxiety symptoms, try to avoid these seven habits that can actually make your anxiety worse.\n\n1. Sitting On The Couch All Day\n\nYou might not believe there is a connection between your mood and your physical activity, but research shows that exercise plays a role in your mental health. Even just 10 minutes of exercise can temporarily alleviate your mood, and regular vigorous exercise can reduce your likeliness of developing anxiety and depression by 25 percent, according to the ADAA.\n\n\n\n2. Skipping Meals\n\n\"Skipping meals actually causes anxiety,\" says Martinez. \"It is not only about eating healthy, it is about eating at all. People probably don't know that skipping meals or eating late cause blood sugar drops that give anxiety-like sensations.\" Certain foods also contain essential nutrients that help to combat anxiety and depression, such as selenium, B vitamins, omega-3 fatty acids, and serotonin.\n\n\n\n3. Drinking Too Much Coffee\n\nMany of us have had a cup of coffee, only to feel the unfortunate side effects of feeling jittery and anxious afterwards. \"Caffeine raises your heart rate and causes us to have that nervous feelings and to feel agitation,\" says Martinez. And for people who are already prone to anxiety, caffeine can exacerbate those effects. According to WebMD, caffeine can lead to sweaty palms, a pounding heart, ringing in the ears, and even a full-blown panic attack.\n\n4. Spending Too Much Time On Social Media\n\n\"If you spend your life 24/7 on technology at work and at home, this actually causes anxiety,\" says Martinez. One study from the Pew Research Center found that the use of social media, particularly Facebook, increases anxiety and stress in people. Other research from the Australian Psychological Society found that 50 percent of teens experience elevated levels of anxiety from FOMO, or fear of missing out.\n\n\n\n5. Staying Up Late\n\n\"Getting enough sleep has a significant impact on mood,\" says Martinez. \"When we are not getting enough sleep, it puts pressure on all systems of the body. Our mental and immune system chemicals are not replenished.\" Research from the Journal of Neuroscience found that when people are sleep-deprived, they experience a surge of anticipatory anxiety, as lack of sleep triggers the areas in your brain responsible for emotional processing. The study also found that people who are already prone to anxiety experience are likely to develop full-blown anxiety disorder from lack of sleep.\n\n\n\n6. Procrastinating\n\nSometimes it is anxiety itself that causes procrastination, but putting things off can make your anxiety worse, as you always feel like there is a task looming. If something is overwhelming, break it up into smaller projects, and get rid of distractions that are holding you back. Reaching a goal releases dopamine in the brain, the chemical responsible for experiencing pleasure and reward, so accomplishing your tasks head on can help quell your anxiety.\n\n\n\n7. Staying Home Alone\n\nYour anxiety may lead you to want to spend time by yourself, but spending time around other people \u2014 as awful as it can seem \u2014 can actually help make you feel better. According to research in the journal PLoS One, social support helps individuals experience less anxiety and stress, helps them with better social functioning, and improves their overall health. Maintaining close relationships is key to experiencing less anxiety, so try to get yourself out there whenever you're feeling up to it.\n\n\n\nNot all of these activities are triggers for everyone, but try cutting out some of these habits to see if they help with your overall anxiety levels.\n\nWant more women's health coverage?

We think of someone anxious, and we conjure up an image in our head of a twitchy-yet-endearing person who says awkward things at weddings and spills wine at dinner parties. But living with an anxiety disorder doesn't only mean you've got some character quirks that set you apart from other people. Anxiety is a mental illness that has just as many physical symptoms as a lifelong disease such as diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nThere are many biological factors that cause your body to react in unpleasant ways when you have anxiety. Your nervous system is more sensitive to external triggers, which means you physically respond to things that may not affect other people. Jodi Aman, a psychotherapist with more than two decades of experience and the author of You 1 Anxiety 0, tells Bustle that these bodily reactions can make us feel like the world is caving in around us. \"The physical symptoms of anxiety are horrible, intense and hard to ignore,\" Aman says. \"You often feel like you are going to die.\" Fun!\n\nIf you're not quite sure whether your physical symptoms are those of anxiety, read through the information below and see if any of them ring true for you. If they do, don't hesitate to reach out for the help you need \u2014 and very much deserve.\n\nHere are eight physical signs of anxiety you shouldn't ignore.\n\nStrained Or Shallow Breathing\n\nWhen you're responding to an anxiety-inducing situation, your body automatically slips into fight-or-flight response, as if it's preparing you to face a life-threatening situation. Stress hormones are then released that constrict your blood vessels, and Aman tells Bustle you end up inadvertently \"breathing to give you aerobic energy to fight or run.\" You might feel like you just can't catch your breath, even if you're sitting still and not lifting a finger. Extreme shortness of breath is also identified as a precursor to a panic attack.\n\nIncreased Heart Rate\n\n\"The biological fear response is a release of hormones adrenaline and norepinephrine,\" Aman tells Bustle. That \"sets off a series of physical reactions,\" and increased heart rate is one of the first things a person with anxiety will experience when they're placed in a stressful situation. It goes hand-in-hand with shortness of breath. In some cases, it can feel like you're about to have a heart attack.\n\nUpset Stomach Or Abdominal Cramps\n\nChanges in your autonomic nervous system brought on by anxiety can result in indigestion. Aman says all your \"blood is going to large muscles, away from the stomach, which is why it gets upset.\" To make matters worse, the adrenaline that courses through your body abruptly turns sugar into glucose, which can disrupt the way your digestive system naturally functions. It also speeds up the way food travels through your body, potentially resulting in abdominal pain, gas, and strange bowel movements. Finally, anxiety can spark weird changes in your appetite that lead to even weirder alterations in your intestinal tract.\n\nYour digestive system has its own rhythm, and when it's disrupted by the sudden entrance of hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, the results are unpredictable. That means someone with chronic anxiety could possibly be living with daily ups and downs in their digestive system.\n\nPain In Your Jaw Or Neck\n\nAnxiety can cause the muscles in your body to tighten and tense up. One place in particular that happens is your jaw. Clenching of the teeth is a common side effect of anxiety, which directly results in aches and pains in the jaw \u2014 and this is only worsened if you also have a habit of grinding your teeth. Even something as simple as facial tension, which is a pretty standard symptom of anxiety, results in jaw pain.\n\nSide effects like jaw discomfort aren't talked about very often, and that's why people sometimes panic when they experience it. \"It is so easy to be afraid of it and think that there is something wrong with you physically,\" Aman says, \"which creates even more intensity.\" Don't think you have to brave out these symptoms all on your own. Reach out to a trusted medical professional and see what can be done.\n\nInexplicable Sweating\n\nIt's certainly not the most glamorous of side effects, but sweating for no reason is brought on by untreated anxiety. All the hormonal buzz happening in your nervous system makes your internal temperature rise. Pair that with the increased heart rate and you've got yourself sweaty armpits, a glistening forehead, and sticky palms. Then you become self-conscious about your damp blouse, which only makes you more anxious, which makes you sweat more, and \u2014 well, you get the picture.\n\nAman says fight-or-flight reactions like these are meant \"to keep you safe if you were in physical danger.\" After all, that's exactly how anxiety makes us feel \u2014 as if we were in immediate danger. Training yourself to understand that you're not in danger at all will help you manage and prevent side effects like profusely sweating.\n\nChronic Headaches Or Migraines\n\nAnxiety can bring on headaches that make you feel like the center of your brain is about to explode. These kinds of tension headaches range from mildly uncomfortable to so excruciating that you can't carry out your daily tasks. The Anxiety and Depression Association of America says headaches are an extremely common side effect of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and that people who suffer from migraines are much more likely to have anxiety than the general population.\n\nFatigue\n\nBattling anxiety is an exhausting task that sucks the energy right out of you. There are all kinds of reasons your body might be fatigued in relation to anxiety. Maybe your anxiety is preventing you from sleeping soundly, perhaps you've been keeping yourself way too busy in an attempt to hide your anxiety, or your brain might simply be tired from all the worrying. Whatever the case may be, fatigue and anxiety tend to travel as a pair.\n\nTo be clear, this isn't the kind of fatigue that makes you yawn and encourages you to go to bed early. Being tired from being anxious can make your whole body ache, your eyes burn, and your head pound. It's a whole new level of exhaustion that stops you from living out your daily life.\n\nRestlessness That Won't Allow You To Sit Still\n\nEven though you want to chill out and relax, your anxiety doesn't always allow it. You might experience a restlessness so invasive that you have no other choice but to move around. Aman describes it as feeling \"highly energized, like you are jumping out of your skin.\" This is especially familiar in people who suffer from high-functioning anxiety. It may look like they're tending to busy schedules, but what they're really doing is living out a basic symptom of their mental illness.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nNo two people with anxiety will have a list of symptoms that looks exactly the same, but if any of these feel hauntingly familiar, you should speak with a doctor right away about your anxiety.\n\n\"I believe the first step in curing anxiety is understanding it biologically,\" Aman says. \"There is help out there.

As someone with anxiety, I don\u2019t often talk about it with my friends, family, or partner because I often feel judged for worrying about \u201cstupid\u201d things or being \u201cirrational.\u201d The truth is, most people know their anxiety isn\u2019t rational. And that doesn\u2019t make it go away. Rather than dismiss our anxiety, it helps for our friends, families, and partners to empathize with it and take it seriously.\n\nPsychotherapist Shira Burstein, LCSW tells Bustle that many people don\u2019t understand how much their loved ones with anxiety are struggling. \u201cSometimes, high-functioning individuals who seem to 'have it all' struggle severely with anxiety AND depression,\u201d she says. \u201cMental health issues sometimes seem 'invisible' or go under the radar because of that.\u201d The truth is, there\u2019s no such thing as looking or acting like you have anxiety (or any mental health issue), so you never know who around you might be struggling or how much they\u2019re struggling unless you ask.\n\nIf you have anxiety, you\u2019ll probably understand the following struggles. And if you don\u2019t, reading about them may help you understand and support people you love who have anxiety.\n\n1 Being Told To \u201cCalm Down\u201d Giphy When people with anxiety are worried about something seemingly small or are generally on edge, people will sometimes tell us to calm down. They usually have good intentions \u2014 specifically, to help the anxiety go away \u2014 but all it really does is make you feel like a burden on them. How calm we are isn't always within our control, and we need to know our loved ones will accept us when we're not \"calm.\"\n\n2 Obsessing Over Tiny Decisions Giphy A typical morning in the mind of someone with anxiety (aka my mind) might sound something like this: \"If I go to a cafe today, it\u2019ll take me approximately 20 minutes to get dressed and walk there. I could work in that 20 minutes, which could make me around $25. And spending money for coffee and food will cost me another $10. But if I stay home, I\u2019ll probably want to eat the cheese and avocado I got yesterday, and replacing them will also cost around $10. And I have a Skype call tomorrow, which I\u2019ll probably want to take from home, so maybe I should leave the house today. But my partner is coming home earlier than usual today, and I want to be here to greet him, because that means we can go to the pharmacy together before it closes. Ugh, I\u2019ve already lost five minutes thinking about this, and 25 minutes out of my workday is another $25. Aah this is too overwhelming I\u2019ll just stay home.\u201d\n\n3 Thinking You\u2019ve Resolved An Issue\u2026 Then Seeing It From Another Perspective Giphy The other day, I decided to go on a trip. The only thing that concerned me was that maybe the beds would be uncomfortable. Once I got reassurance that they were comfortable, I started thinking, what if there are mosquitos? I reassured myself I could bring bug spray, I thought, but what if there are snakes? When I learned there were no poisonous snakes, I decided I was OK with going there. But then I thought: what if my boss doesn\u2019t like me missing work? Your anxiety will show you a situation from a thousand different angles to try to convince you that you should be anxious. Usually, none of those fears are the actual reason you\u2019re anxious. You just are.\n\n4 Choosing Between Constantly Being Anxious Or Dealing With Awful Medication Side Effects Giphy Meds can save lives. They can also zap your energy, sex drive, and enjoyment of sex. Unless you\u2019re lucky enough to find meds that work for you with no crappy side effects, you often have to choose between your sanity and your ability to orgasm.\n\n5 Being Told You Don\u2019t Seem Like You Have Anxiety Giphy When someone confides in you that they have anxiety, the appropriate response is not to tell them how \u201cchill\u201d they actually seem. When you say this, you\u2019re implying that their struggles aren\u2019t real. The only person who knows what\u2019s running through someone\u2019s head \u2014 and, therefore, the only person who can tell you if they have anxiety \u2014 is that person themselves.\n\n6 Getting Anxious About Your Anxiety Giphy Most people with anxiety know worrying isn\u2019t particularly good for you, but that just tends to make us more anxious.

Redditors\u2019 complaints ranged from people not believing that mental illness is real, to people assuming that anyone with mental illness is violent. Two things that come through the thread loud and clear, however, are that mental illness is not well understood by much of the general public, and that the stigma and misinformation that surround mental disorders in the United States harms those dealing with them in a very real way.\n\nChances are, you or someone you know are affected by mental illness in a significant way. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), one in five American adults per year experiences mental illness \u2014 that\u2019s 43.8 million people, or 18.5 percent of the adult population. Every year, one in 25 U.S. adults deals with a mental illness severe enough to hinder their ability to participate in \u201cmajor life activities.\u201d And a lot of people aren\u2019t getting treatment: In the last year, only 41 percent of adults with mental disorders got help from mental health services.\n\nThere are a variety of reasons that people don\u2019t receive the mental healthcare they need, but a major one is the stigma that continues to plague mental illness. Widespread misconceptions about how mental illnesses work, how they should be treated, and why people have them certainly don\u2019t help either.\n\nOn AskReddit, redditors talked about the stigmas and myths about mental illness that they find most frustrating. Although it\u2019s worth scrolling through the whole thread, there are a few common themes that emerged:\n\n1. People think that mental illness is a choice, and that you just need to \u201cbuck up\u201d or \u201cpower through.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs redditor cleanbubble points out, too many people think that mental illness is somehow a choice, and that, in turn, one can simply \"choose\" to be happy. This mindset perpetuates the harmful myth that mental disorders are symptoms of weakness, and that people who have them lack strength or resolve. This myth ignores that fact that coping with a mental illness in itself requires enormous emotional, physical, and mental resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. People think that if they can\u2019t see you suffering, you must be OK.\n\n\n\n\n\nand physical) that aren't visually obvious, but that are legitimately debilitating. Many mental conditions are invisible illnesses , but that doesn't mean they aren't real. People shouldn't make assumptions about other people's health based on physical appearance alone \u2014 there are many health conditions (both mentalphysical) that aren't visually obvious, but thatlegitimately debilitating.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Myths about medication.\n\nA number of redditors said that a lot of people simply don't seem to understand how medication works when it comes to mental disorders. Some people had experienced others assuming that mental health issues could easily \"cured\" by medication. Other respondents said they'd gotten the opposite treatment, having encountered people who think that medication is a sham and that mental illness could instead be treated with exercise, sunshine, and healthy eating.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. People believe that you have to have a reason to be depressed or anxious.\n\nMany redditors argued that a lot of people fundamentally misunderstand disorders like depression and anxiety, assuming that they are simply matters of being sad or worried about specific triggers. What these people fail to see is that these mental conditions can and often do exist separately from external \"reasons.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. They think that people with mental disorders cannot function in society, or that they are prone to violence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany people believe that those dealing with mental disorders are incapable of living full, productive lives. This is FALSE. Furthermore, a number of redditors said that they often encounter stereotypes that portray people with mental illnesses as unpredictable and violent (Think serial killers on TV). As redditor burritozen points out, people with mental disorders are actually more at risk of violence than of committing violence themselves. According to the Washington State Coalition for Mental Health Reporting, the \"vast majority of people with mental illness are not violent.\" In fact, research shows that people with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, psychosis, or other severe mental illnesses are 2.5 times \u201cmore likely to be attacked, raped or mugged than the general population.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n6. They believe that mental illness is less important or less real than physical illness.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo one would hesitate to provide medical aid to someone with a broken bone or to take that person's pain seriously. We need to approach mental health conditions in the same way: They are health problems, not matters of personal weakness, and they are as legitimate as any other health issue.\n\nImages: Unsplash/Pexels; Screenshots/Reddit (14)", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/181678-people-with-mental-illnesses-share-the-stigmas-that-upset-them-most-on-askreddit", "summary": "Yesterday, an AskReddit thread asked redditors, \u201cPeople with mental illnesses, what is one stigma you're tired of?\u201d Hundreds of people wrote in to share the stigmas and myths about mental illness that bother them the most.\nRedditors\u2019 complaints ranged from people not believing that mental illness is real, to people assuming that anyone with mental illness is violent.\nAccording to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), one in five American adults per year experiences mental illness \u2014 that\u2019s 43.8 million people, or 18.5 percent of the adult population.\nWidespread misconceptions about how mental illnesses work, how they should be treated, and why people have them certainly don\u2019t help either.\nAccording to the Washington State Coalition for Mental Health Reporting, the \"vast majority of people with mental illness are not violent.\"", "timescraped": 1513838699.1623092, "category": {"words": 783, "personal": 1, "thirdperson": 18, "condition": 37, "recovery": 0}}, "34ed7cf961921a8d08348014e0b873b5": {"title": "5 Mental Health Issues That Affect Women More Than Men", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost%2F2016%2F9%2F13%2Fb1715220-da67-42d6-9c7c-4546641d1ce2.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "text": "Mental health issues widely affect both men and women, so regardless of gender, we should all be taking our mental health seriously. That said, there are certain mental health issues that affect women most, and this is due to a mixture of biological factors, (women develop less serotonin than men do and our bodies process it slower) socio-cultural influences, (workplace inequality, body shaming, and the pressure to \"have it all\"), as well as the fact the we have statistically higher chances of experiencing sexual abuse, domestic violence, rape, and attempted rape in our lifetime. It's clear that if you're female, it's imperative that you educate yourself on the gender-specific mental health risks women face.\n\nAccording to a 2015 study published by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), women are more likely to experience serious psychological distress than men are. Women are also up to 40 percent more likely to develop mental illnesses than men, so women in particular should be aware that gender does play a role in mental health.\n\nWhether you've struggled with your mental health or not, it's important to know how your mind and body are pre-disposed to certain mental health issues so that you can better understand how to keep yourself healthy. Here are five mental health issues that affect women more often than men.\n\n1. Depression\n\nDepression is twice as common in women as it is in men, (12 percent of women experience depression compared to six percent of men) and there are multiple physical, psychological, and socio-cultural reasons for this.\n\nAs I said above, women develop less of the feel-good chemical serotonin, and we process it slower. Additionally, our hormone levels naturally fluctuate more than men's do, (thanks a lot, estrogen) especially during the childbearing process and menopause, which affects mood. On top of that, women are often under more stress than men since we're expected to (and often want to) juggle so many different roles.\n\nAlso, women are simply more likely to seek out diagnoses and treatment of depression than men are, and physicians are more likely to diagnose a woman with depression than they are a man.\n\n2. Anxiety\n\n[Embed]\n\nAccording to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, (ADAA) women are also twice as likely to develop General Anxiety Disorder (GAD), panic disorder, and certain phobias than men are. Again, this is largely attributed to that same unfortunate trifecta of biological, socio-cultural, and psychological reasons that we talked about above.\n\nFortunately, there are a lot of ways to manage anxiety, from breathing techniques to medication. So if you or a loved one is suffering from anxiety, know that you don't have to do it without help.\n\n3. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)\n\n[Embed]\n\nWhile Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is more commonly associated with men (particularly men who have seen active military duty), of the 7.7 million Americans who suffer from PTSD, women are actually twice as likely to develop the disorder following a traumatic event than men are.\n\n\n\nThis could be because rape is the number one trigger of PTSD, and nearly one in five women will be raped in their lifetime, whereas statistics show that only one in 33 men (which is obviously still a horrible number) will be raped in their lifetime.\n\nChildhood sexual abuse is another major contributor to lifetime struggles with PTSD, and a sickening 82 percent of juvenile sexual abuse victims are girls.\n\n4. Suicide Attempts\n\nThough men die from suicide four times as often as women do \u2014 77.9 percent of suicides in the U.S. are male \u2014 women actually attempt suicide two to three times more often than men do. According the the CDC's research, women are more likely to have suicidal thoughts, (undoubtedly because we're more likely to suffer from depression, anxiety, and PTSD) but male suicide attempts are usually more violent and impulsive, making them more \"successful.\"\n\n\n\n5. Eating Disorders\n\n\n\n\n \nIf you or someone you love is struggling with an eating disorder or any other mental health issue, don't ignore it or trust that it will get better on it's own. Please seek treatment; your mental health is precious, and you shouldn't feel like you have to \"fix it\" all by yourself.", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/112287-5-mental-health-issues-that-affect-women-more-than-men", "summary": "Mental health issues widely affect both men and women, so regardless of gender, we should all be taking our mental health seriously.\nIt's clear that if you're female, it's imperative that you educate yourself on the gender-specific mental health risks women face.\nWomen are also up to 40 percent more likely to develop mental illnesses than men, so women in particular should be aware that gender does play a role in mental health.\nWhether you've struggled with your mental health or not, it's important to know how your mind and body are pre-disposed to certain mental health issues so that you can better understand how to keep yourself healthy.\nHere are five mental health issues that affect women more often than men.", "timescraped": 1513838700.529213, "category": {"words": 696, "personal": 11, "thirdperson": 4, "condition": 17, "recovery": 0}}, "204b7b9990fffe12a8e99ce6a0bf7724": {"title": "5 Things People With Mental Health Issues Should Always Remember", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost%2F2016%2F9%2F13%2Ff41c49bb-11d4-41d1-8c52-399f769eb308.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "text": "Having a mental illness is no picnic. On top of managing the illness itself, you may be battling societal misconceptions, family worry and your own self-blame and concern \u2014 which is the least fun cocktail since the prairie oyster. In the face of the various challenges afoot, it can be difficult to keep a balanced perspective on what's happening to you \u2014 particularly if you're scared, don't know a lot about the situation, or are feeling pressure from those around you. That's where this guide comes in; it's meant to jog your memory about the truths of mental illness and those who have it.\n\nApproaches to your situation don't have to be dour or serious: the Huffington Post is currently beginning a campaign called The Best Medicine, about the use of humor and comedy to combat and alleviate mental health issues. But if you need a hand up and some new viewpoints, I've compiled a look at some of the most vital bits of mental health experience, from historical context to the mentally ill community worldwide. There are rather a lot of us; regrettably, we don't hold club nights or go on fun runs, but there are some fundamentals we should all keep in mind.\n\nHere are five things that all mentally ill people should try to remember; but don't beat yourself up if you forget sometimes. If it weren't hard to remember them, there'd be no need for reminders.\n\n1. You\u2019re Not Alone\n\nWithout access to proper statistics or support networks, having a mental illness can be an excruciatingly isolating business, with shame, guilt and a deep sense of \"weirdness\" pervading the issue. However, the overwhelming bulk of data on mental illness indicates that across the full spectrum of population and diagnosis, it's very common; there is no reason for you to feel as if you're a unique case, even if nobody in your personal sphere has experience with mental difficulties.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust looking at the US? The National Mental Health Institute makes a conservative estimate that in 2014 alone, 18.1 percent of the adult population had some kind of mental illness, from the mild to the severe. That's 43.6 million people, and that number doesn't include children, soldiers on active duty, the homeless, or people in mental institutions; so the number is likely significantly higher. You're the opposite of alone: you're part of a gigantic community, one that needs the freedom to be more vocal and less silenced by shame and misconceptions.\n\n2. You\u2019re Not In The First Generation To Grapple With These Problems\n\nThis is one of the most frustrating pieces of rhetoric around mental illness: that it was somehow \"invented\" by the modern era. There are definite, and often very solid, arguments about the contributions of certain parts of modern life to mental illness development; an article in the Journal of Affective Disorders in 2012, for example, argued that the modern tendency to be \"overfed, malnourished, sedentary, sunlight-deficient, sleep-deprived, and socially-isolated\" all contribute to a higher likelihood of developing depression. However, it's important not to throw all your blame at contemporary trends. Mental illnesses of various forms have been a feature of human history for centuries, but the language with which we discuss them has shifted significantly.\n\n\n\nMelancholia, for instance, was a category of description for various symptoms of depression, malaise and anger. It was used for several thousands of years; it was originally thought by the Greeks to exist due to an over-abundance of black bile in the body (the physician Hippocrates famously found the melancholic Democritus in his garden cutting up animal bodies to see how the bile could be stemmed). Robert Burton famously published his Anatomy of Melancholy in 1638, in which he argued that melancholy was the essence of the human condition. From that point, we've moved towards a more physical understanding of depression, including its possible roots in a serotonin uptake problem in the brain; but that's just a new understanding of a very old problem.\n\nAnd when it comes to anxiety, we've been discussing the possible evolutionary origins of the fight-or-flight impulse (and how it can go wrong) since the 19th century. But the New York Times points out that anxietas is an ancient word derived from \"unease... within a framework of sin, redemption and eternal judgment,\" and medieval and Renaissance ideas about \"hysteria\" in women may have fed into general ideas about the biological basis for anxieties in general. And schizophrenia is a relatively new classification for a collection of mental symptoms, which, as Scientific American noted, have appeared in various societies in history as attributable to demonic possession, \"dirtiness\", holy visions and other supernatural roots. Whatever your particular illness, it didn't come from out of nowhere; it's part of human mental history.\n\n3. You\u2019re Not Weak\n\nThere's a very strong view in psychological and medical circles that mental illness is a physical problem: that it is created by, and demonstrated through, distinct signs and symptoms in the body, specifically in the brain. Creating a \"map\" of each illness's potential physical shape is becoming more possible thanks to what the American Psychological Assocation calls \"the new toolkit\": rapid advances in neural imaging and understanding of neural circuitry. The APA's perspective is that the majority of serious mental illnesses may be traced back to brain dysfunction, but that these dysfunctions may be triggered by \"important environmental, behavioral and social factors;\" in other words, you're not just your brain, but your brain is exceedingly important in understanding the development of your mental illness.\n\nWhat does this mean? It basically means that you are not a \"failure\" or \"weak-willed\" for developing a mental illness. We're making huge strides in our understanding of the biological basis for various mental disorders; a 2013 breakthrough in Cardiff, for instance, linked a certain collection of genes to the potential for mental health worries . You can't help your biology; and, frankly, you also often can't help a dangerous or threatening context that might encourage mental dysfunction to flourish. There shouldn't be blame in your experience of your difficulties.\n\n\n\n4. You Haven\u2019t Brought This On Yourself\n\nSee above. But this is another prong of \"blame\" when it comes to mental illness: the idea that if you'd made other choices, done better things, taken one route instead of another, you wouldn't be in your current situation. One: the biological determinants of mental illness may mean that you'd be ill no matter what happened in your life or what choices you'd made. Two: many of the contextual factors that seem to contribute to, or exacerbate, the development of mental health symptoms are not easily escaped. The World Health Organization labels poverty as \"one of the strongest predictors of mental disorders\"; academics also note that stressful or violent environments are high on the list. Stress during childhood (or even while in the womb), low socioeconomic status, poor parental mental health, jobs with low control and reward, levels of debt and chronic ill health all contribute to mental health issues, too.\n\nThe thing you should notice about all those factors? They are, regrettably, often out of your own hands when it comes to your risk level. It is not helpful to blame yourself for your own condition; it's more productive to attempt to get help.\n\n5. You Are Still Worthy Of Love\n\nAccording to a groundbreaking 2013 survey, public perceptions of mental illness are changing, but there's still a ways to go in reaching wider understanding, sympathy and acceptance \u2014 and that's a problem. It can be critically difficult for people with mental illnesses to maintain a sense of their own worth in the face of societal criticism, particularly if the illness itself is highly self-critical, like depression. But hanging on to this perception, even in a slender form, is deeply important.\n\nSelf-esteem in general has been argued to be a productive strategy for helping ordinary mental health, but developing it in the mentally ill is another kettle of fish. The practice of self-compassion, self-forgiveness and self-acceptance is difficult but important to everybody with a mental illness; you're worthwhile, you're loveable, you're valuable and people want you around. If you don't feel you have any worth and are currently in therapeutic treatment, please mention this to your therapist; if you're not in treatment, talk to somebody in your friendship group or family, or call a helpline like one of those on the list provided by Psych Central.\n\nImages: Craig Dennis/ Pexels, Pixabay, Giphy", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/169533-5-things-people-with-mental-health-issues-should-always-remember", "summary": "The National Mental Health Institute makes a conservative estimate that in 2014 alone, 18.1 percent of the adult population had some kind of mental illness, from the mild to the severe.\nIt basically means that you are not a \"failure\" or \"weak-willed\" for developing a mental illness.\nTwo: many of the contextual factors that seem to contribute to, or exacerbate, the development of mental health symptoms are not easily escaped.\nStress during childhood (or even while in the womb), low socioeconomic status, poor parental mental health, jobs with low control and reward, levels of debt and chronic ill health all contribute to mental health issues, too.\nThe practice of self-compassion, self-forgiveness and self-acceptance is difficult but important to everybody with a mental illness; you're worthwhile, you're loveable, you're valuable and people want you around.", "timescraped": 1513838701.806923, "category": {"words": 1435, "personal": 8, "thirdperson": 6, "condition": 32, "recovery": 0}}, "79975d5b57e0e864d4abed5fa6a420e4": {"title": "Do Women Suffer Mental Illness More Than Men? 8 Factors Behind The Gender Imbalance In Treatment", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost/2016/9/13/3fcafea4-096a-403b-a290-3f0efe94f1ab.jpg?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "text": "The statistics don't lie: women are treated for more mental illnesses than men.

But the argument over what's really behind this imbalance \u2014 and whether it represents what's really going on \u2014 has been raging for years.\n\nAny scientific study that tries to probe a perceived divide between the sexes is open to accusations of sexism \u2014 and mental illness, with its attached stigma, is a tricky problem on its own without the added layer of gender to complicate things further. The type of illness being discussed also matters: schizophrenia, for instance, appears to hit both genders equally, according to the World Health Organization, as does bipolar disorder, though genders seem to develop and feel them differently.

Do women really have more mental illnesses, or do they just communicate more readily with doctors? Do they suffer because we expect it of them, or because they're more physically prone and societally vulnerable \u2014 or some combination of both?\n\nProfessor Daniel Freeman, an expert at the University of Oxford who's worked at length on the problem, told Bustle via email that the \"research has only just scratched the surface\".\n\n\"The best U.S. survey showed that 35 percent of women met criteria [for a mental illness] during the previous year, as compared to 30 percent of men,\" he said. \"And this could well be an underestimate.\"\n\nSo what's really going on? Here are eight factors why women are seeking treatment from mental illness more often than men.\n\n1. Men Are Less Likely To Seek Help Than Women\n\nWomen are proportionally more likely to seek help than men \u2014 because, Professor Freeman tells Bustle, of \"men\u2019s reluctance to admit to \u201cunmasculine\u201d feelings or experience.\"\n\n\"We can never ... know exactly how many men are not reporting psychological problems,\" he said. He mentioned a study of fear in men and women that showed that men habitually underplayed their fear levels to researchers, presumably because they wanted to seem more \"manly\" and less vulnerable. Women, however, are more likely to seek out help and a diagnosis, which can skew the picture of actual illness levels. But that's not the whole story.\n\n2. Women Face Far More Societal Pressure\n\nDepression and anxiety aren't purely physical diagnoses \u2014 while genetic vulnerability plays a part, they're often products of changes and stress in the environment. Experts increasingly believe that the enormous pressures on women in today's society are a huge contributing factor to their vulnerability to mental illness.\n \nWe're also uncovering the very real impact that sexism and misogyny have on women's mental health. A researcher on the subject, Dr. Laurel B. Watson, told the feminist writer Jessica Valenti in January that living under the constant threat of sexual violence and abuse causes women to live in stress and fear. \u201cOver time, existing in a state of hypervigilance has a negative impact, and leads to a higher level of psychological distress,\" she said.\n\n3. Women Are More Likely To Be Poor And/Or Abused\n\nAdd to the daily stress of womanhood the added possibility of poverty and abuse, and you have a pretty toxic cocktail for depression and anxiety-related disorders. Anybody who reads the news knows that women are more poverty-stricken than men worldwide; the UN estimates that 70 percent of the 1.3 billion people in grinding poverty worldwide are female. A study in 1990 showed that, unsurprisingly, the stresses of poverty and deprivation are pretty conclusively linked to the development of mental illness, and the vulnerability of women puts them particularly at risk.\n\nWomen are also, sadly, hugely more likely than men to be abused at some point in their lives, particularly in childhood. \"There are a range of social and psychological factors that especially impact on women that should lead us to expect differences in overall rates of mental health problems,\" Freeman said to me. \"The most obvious example is childhood sexual abuse.\"\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice says that 62,939 cases of child sexual abuse were reported in 2012 \u2014 and seven percent of girls in grades 5-8 reported they'd been sexually abused in their lifetime. Unsurprisingly, childhood sexual abuse is a pretty strong risk factor for depression later in life.\n\n4. Women Are More 'Ruminative'\n\nStudies show that \"ruminative\" thinking, which means incessantly probing and repeating a thought (it comes from the Latin word for chewing cud), is a contributing factor to developing depression: the American Psychiatric Association calls it \"the depression-rumination cycle.\" Dwell on a thought incessantly and you'll drive yourself into a hole.\n\nStudies have shown that women are more prone to ruminative thinking than men, though the reasons for the difference aren't yet known. A study in 2001 suggested that ruminative thinking in women was drawn from their feeling of responsibility in relationships, while another suggested that it was inspired by a lack of \"mastery,\" or self-belief. Basically, we obsess too damn much.\n\n5. Women Have To Deal With More Hormonal Shifts\n\nA potential risk factor for the development of depression is a shift in hormone levels in the body (which is why postpartum depression is a thing; hormones go haywire after birth.) Hormone imbalances play havoc with mood, specifically the Big 3: cortisol, oestrogen, and progesterone. And women are more prone to hormonal tides and ebbs over their lives, from adolescence to pregnancy, birth, and menopause. This is, obviously, annoying, but it's unfortunately true. (We also live longer than men and will consequently get old, which is a prime time to develop depression. Way to go.)\n\n6. Mental Health Itself Is Viewed In Gendered Ways\n\nDan Kitwood/Getty Images News/Getty Images\n\nWe still see women as fundamentally less stable than men. It's just a fact \u2014 and it's borne out by depictions in media and entertainment. This kind of internalized sexism is likely a contributing factor of our greater development of mental illness; a study in 2009 found that internalising sexist ideas led directly to women feeling psychological distress.\n\nThe stereotypes of mental strength in genders \u2014 that women are more emotionally intelligent and empathetic, while men are seen as objective and emotionally reserved \u2014 may also be self-predicting in some ways, like in the propensity for women to have internalizing rather than externalizing disorders (depression rather than alcohol abuse). Belief in men's mental inability to handle emotion, for instance, may be a contributor to male alcohol dependency and suicide rates: they don't believe they know how to cope, and don't want to ask. And women's belief in their own emotional intelligence may lead to the feeling of relationship responsibility that feeds into ruminative thinking and treatment.\n\n7. Women Are More Genetically Predisposed To Depression\n\nMario Tama/Getty Images News/Getty Images\n\nBefore you hold up your hands and cry foul, hear this one out; it's based on a study from 2001 of 2974 sets of twins, which found that if one twin had depression, their genetically identical twin (with 100 percent of the same DNA) would also have it, while fraternally identical twins (who are only 50 percent genetically identical) didn't. Depression, then, seems to have a genetic base \u2014 and the study also found that female twins were far more likely to develop it than males.\n\nWe've yet to determine exactly what the genetic code for depression is. A 2011 study found that genetic variations on one chromosome, 3p25-26, are linked to severe recurrent depression, but there was no data on whether it showed up in women more than men. And one chromosome may not tell the whole story. So stay tuned on this one.\n\n8. Female Brains May Respond Differently To Stress\n\nDan Kitwood/Getty Images News/Getty Images\n\nAn interesting study in 2010 revealed that, not only are women receiving much more stress from their environment, their brains may cope with it differently to men's \u2014 because of a particular stress hormone. Female rats had more of a particular stress hormone in their brains to begin with, and after being exposed to stress, it stayed around in the brain causing havoc \u2014 while male rats had a way to \"shut off\" the parts of the brain that were interacting with the stress hormone. The result? Female rats stayed stressed and anxious for longer, while male rats could quietly adapt and go eat some tasty lab food. If this applies in humans too, it explains a lot.\n\nProfessor Freeman thought it was significant too. \"If we think of stress as a chisel striking a rock,\" he told me, \"the blows women receive from the environment may sometimes be stronger (think childhood sexual abuse), more persistent (think social role burden), and differently angled (think relationships). This might explain why women experience more psychological problems than men. But where exactly the rock splits \u2014 that is, the specific disorder that develops \u2014 may depend on psychological and biological fault lines. And perhaps these fault lines differ by gender.\" One of those fault lines, it seems, may be receptors for stress hormones.\n\nSo next time anybody tells you women are \"just crazy,\" tell them it's not their fault: it's society, genetics, poverty, hormones and the rumination cycle. That'll shut them up.\n\nImage: Julia Shashkina/Flickr, Wikimedia Commons, Getty", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/83245-do-women-suffer-mental-illness-more-than-men-8-factors-behind-the-gender-imbalance-in-treatment", "summary": "Twenty-nine percent of women have been treated for a mental illness of some kind, as opposed to 17 percent of men, according to the British Mental Health Foundation.\nBut work is being done \u2014 and we're beginning to understand what's actually going on in the battle for female mental health.\n\"The best U.S. survey showed that 35 percent of women met criteria [for a mental illness] during the previous year, as compared to 30 percent of men,\" he said.\nHere are eight factors why women are seeking treatment from mental illness more often than men.\nExperts increasingly believe that the enormous pressures on women in today's society are a huge contributing factor to their vulnerability to mental illness.", "timescraped": 1513838703.1042109, "category": {"words": 1627, "personal": 6, "thirdperson": 29, "condition": 25, "recovery": 0}}, "8d544d1c7045d7dfffb79f6b2b76102f": {"title": "Cliquez, Signalez !", "image": "http://www.pointdecontact.net/sites/all/themes/pdc_2012/favicon.ico", "text": "Images ou repr\u00e9sentations \u00e0 caract\u00e8re sexuel mettant en sc\u00e8ne des mineurs\n\nSollicitation sexuelle d'un mineur (grooming)\n\nContenus pornographiques, violents ou contraires \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 humaine accessibles aux mineurs\n\nIncitation \u00e0 la violence, \u00e0 la discrimination ou \u00e0 la haine\n\nProvocation aux crimes et d\u00e9lits contre les personnes\n\nProvocation au terrorisme ou \u00e0 la fabrication de bombes\n\nApologie de crimes de guerre ou contestation de crimes contre l\u2019humanit\u00e9\n\nProvocation au suicide", "url": "http://www.pointdecontact.net/cliquez_signalez", "summary": "Images ou repr\u00e9sentations \u00e0 caract\u00e8re sexuel mettant en sc\u00e8ne des mineursSollicitation sexuelle d'un mineur (grooming)Contenus pornographiques, violents ou contraires \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 humaine accessibles aux mineursIncitation \u00e0 la violence, \u00e0 la discrimination ou \u00e0 la haineProvocation aux crimes et d\u00e9lits contre les personnesProvocation au terrorisme ou \u00e0 la fabrication de bombesApologie de crimes de guerre ou contestation de crimes contre l\u2019humanit\u00e9Provocation au suicide", "timescraped": 1513838704.69781, "category": {"words": 64, "personal": 0, "thirdperson": 0, "condition": 0, "recovery": 0}}, "7fb24510dc7d5dab01232f34302570ac": {"title": "Zayn Malik's \"Cruel\" Lyrics Could Be About His Personal Life & Struggle With Anxiety \u2014 LISTEN", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost%2F2016%2F9%2F14%2Fe49edd02-b002-4cd4-a1fa-d00dd5ee4dee.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "text": "Zayn Malik, you overachiever, you.

(Yes, there's already such a thing.) An emotional, brooding, electro-pop beat with R&B influences and slow-burning vocals. It's the lyrics for Zayn's \"Cruel,\" however, that paint a more personal picture than anything Mind of Mine gave us.\n\nThough the tracks on Mind of Mine were a peek into the mind of the artist, they didn't delve into the one thing Zayn's been candid about since the album's release \u2014 his struggle with anxiety. In June, Zayn canceled a scheduled performance at the Summertime Ball in London. He issued a statement on social media regarding the decision, stating \"Unfortunately my anxiety that has haunted me throughout the last few months around live performances has gotten the better of me\" adding \"with the magnitude of the event, I have suffered the worst anxiety of my career.\"\n\nDid this struggle spark creative insight? \"Cruel\" follows Zayn's distress and disillusionment with the world, but it's not all bad news. He's enchanted by a certain \"Venus in Converse\" that helps guide him through the bleakness. Considering Zayn's personal life (or what we know of it), \"Cruel\" seems to be his most intimate tune yet \u2014 in more ways than one.\n\n[Embed]\n\nCop radio screaming\n\nNoise and tears\n\n(Death on the TV...)\n\nAnd then there's you\n\nIt's f**ked, it's crazy\n\nI can't concentrate\n\nJust see your eyes and...\n\n\n\nI think we can all gather whose eyes Zayn might be referring to...\n\n[Embed]\n\nMhmmm.\n\n\n\nBack where we left off\n\nWatch you take your dress off\n\nI've been by myself remembering you\n\nYour body hurts me\n\nLoopin' 'round like CCTV\n\nIn all this bitterness you stay so sweet...\n\nIt's true. In all the bitterness, there's a certain famous model who stays pretty sweet. In June, right after Zayn announced his canceled show, Gigi Hadid posted a supportive and sentimental response, to her own Twitter. She wrote, \"I've seen the battles you go through and the way you fight to get to a place that allows you to get up there for your fans,\" and \"We are all here to support you and make each experience easier. Your talent and good heart will never lead you wrong.

Maybe it doesn't matter. All that matters is that despite the rocky summer \u2014 and the cruel world \u2014 it's just the two of them now, locked inside the bathroom together.

It's hard to stay calm amidst life's stresses, and once we find ourselves getting worked up, it's challenging to bring ourselves back to neutral. By finding ways to calm down our emotions, we will be better able to take control of our states and move on from stressful situations in a clearer and more efficient manner.\n\nAs a certified health coach, I find that people tend to bottle up their emotions, and this can often lead to an uncontrollable outburst, once they have reached that breaking point. It's best to acknowledge your emotional state, accept it, validate it, and then try and move on. If your emotions involve another individual, communicate with that person in a rational, levelheaded tone to reach a common ground. If your emotions come from personal stresses, take some time for yourself and do something that makes you feel comforted and happy.\n\nIf you find yourself chronically unable to control your emotional response to situations, it might be beneficial to speak with a therapist who specializes in DBT, a type of therapy that focuses on emotional regulation.\n\nHere are eleven ways to stabilize your mood and stop emotions in their tracks, before you do something you might regret.\n\n1. Acknowledge Your Thoughts\n\nTaking note of your thoughts and feelings, as well as validating them, can help you move on. \"Unhelpful thoughts often pop into our minds without our conscious control and science is now showing that fighting against unhelpful thoughts usually only serves to amplify them and in turn magnify our emotional experience,\" shares Chicago-based therapist Chelsea Hudson in an interview with Bustle. Address thoughts head-on, rather than push them away. Once done, shape thoughts towards a positive direction.\n\n\n\n2. Separate Yourself From Your Emotions\n\nKeep in mind that your thoughts and emotions don't define you. \"Remind yourself that 'you are not your thoughts' and that 'feelings aren\u2019t facts,'\" says Hudson. \"There is a big difference between having the thought that you\u2019re undesirable and actually being undesirable.\" If you let your thoughts define your core, you'll become hopeless and more apt to dwell in negativity. Be the best version of yourself, one that can be resilient.\n\n\n\n3. Bring Humor & Lightheartedness To Your Emotions\n\nBy making your emotions seem silly and lighthearted, it'll quell the rage and sadness you might feel. \"Sing the thought out loud, say the thought in a cartoon character voice or write the thought on paper and make a picture out of it,\" says Hudson. By creating a pretty painting and letting your fun, playful side shine through, despite the hardship you are dealing with, you'll become less aroused and better able to calm down.\n\n\n\n4. Let Bodily Reactions Happen\n\nIf you feel anxiety in your body, don't freak out. Instead, try and relax your muscles, take a few deep breaths and let a sense of calm take over your being. \"Instead of trying to push the sensations away, allow them to simply pass through your body like a wave,\" recommends Hudson. Sweaty palms, racing heart, flushed face and twitching muscles are all symptoms of physical stress, so perhaps putting a few ice cubes on your forehead or wrists in conjunction with peaceful thoughts can help cool the body down.\n\n\n\n5. Don't Judge Yourself For Being Emotional\n\nAs humans, it's natural to become emotional every now and then. Take your emotions for what they are and validate them as real feelings, without judging yourself for being vulnerable. \"If you can non-judgmentally observe their presence, they will reach their peak more quickly and eventually dissipate without any effort on your behalf,\" says Hudson, regarding the amount of time it takes for intense emotions to vanish. If you start hating on yourself, you will only feel worse.\n\n\n\n6. Take A Breather\n\nResearch shows that taking deep breaths can alleviate stressful emotions. Our bodies have been wired to have the \"fight-or-flight\" hormone, in response to cortisol, which is activated under stress. However, breathing can reduce cortisol's effects, thus calming our body down and bringing us back to a clearer mental and physical state. Try these three breathing exercises for a greater sense of tranquility.\n\n\n\n7. Cry, If You Need To\n\n\"If you need to cry, there is a reason, and the tears should come out. It's healthy to experience a full range of emotions,\" says healthy lifestyle coach, Liz Traines, in an email interview with Bustle. Let yourself be vulnerable and cry if you need to. Don't worry about mascara; just let yourself be. It's best to cry alone or in the comfort of people you trust, rather than on the street or at work, so be mindful of your location.\n\n\n\n8. Get Fresh Air\n\nExperts claim that fresh air can calm emotions, as it connects us with nature and beauty and brings fresh oxygen into our lungs. Even better? Take yourself for a brisk walk outside, as the movement can provide mood-boosting endorphins and promote healthy blood flow. Taking a few moments to yourself allows you to collect your thoughts, calm your body and separate yourself from the situation.\n\n\n\n9. Channel Your Emotions Into Something Positive\n\nLet your emotions enhance your creativity and performance. \"If you're angry, try to do something constructive with your anger,\" says Traines, who also suggests deep breathing. \"Breathe in for 4, hold it for 7, and exhale for 8. Do this 4 times,\" she recommends, as it helps you become more centered and productive. Channel emotions into your art, as well. Write a story, sing a relatable song, doodle, or work on a project you have been putting off.\n\n\n\n10. Exercise\n\n\"Exercise is a fantastic mood stabilizer and way to feel more connected to the world around you,\" says Susie Lemmer, running coach and blogger at Suzlyfe, in an interview with Bustle. She even shares her own personal story regarding struggles she has encountered with anxiety and depression. Read her tips on how to heal yourself from anxiety and gain more control over your emotions, leading to a higher quality of life and self-esteem.\n\n\n\n11. Meditate\n\nResearch shows that closing your eyes and meditating can keep emotions under control. Beyond calming the body and mind through deep breaths, it also enhances cognitive function, allowing you to think clearer and more rationally through problems and emotional hardships. Meditate for a few minutes regularly to create a healthy habit regarding emotional regulation, or use when you feel a stress attack about to hit.\n\n\n\nWhile it's important to address your emotions, it is critical to keep them under control and move on efficiently and quickly so that you can start enjoying your life again. When emotions involve another person, it's vital to work with that person and communicate your thoughts well in order to overcome the tension. With these tips, you'll be back to feeling like yourself, happy, confident and in control, in no time.\n\nImages: Pexels (12)", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/162631-11-ways-to-stabilize-your-mood-when-youre-feeling-emotional", "summary": "It's best to acknowledge your emotional state, accept it, validate it, and then try and move on.\nHere are eleven ways to stabilize your mood and stop emotions in their tracks, before you do something you might regret.\nIf you let your thoughts define your core, you'll become hopeless and more apt to dwell in negativity.\nGet Fresh AirExperts claim that fresh air can calm emotions, as it connects us with nature and beauty and brings fresh oxygen into our lungs.\nTaking a few moments to yourself allows you to collect your thoughts, calm your body and separate yourself from the situation.", "timescraped": 1513838707.585081, "category": {"words": 1152, "personal": 13, "thirdperson": 17, "condition": 4, "recovery": 0}}, "7efc760b27bc87c21d8d8771b75ebd90": {"title": "The One Thing You Should Know About Dating Someone With Anxiety", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost%2F2016%2F9%2F14%2F354c8586-5f2c-4768-ba37-bdb30432ad23.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "text": "Approximately 40 million Americans suffer from anxiety disorders, and I can tell you from personal experience that anxiety seriously affects relationships. So if your partner is an anxious person, here's the one thing to know about dating someone with anxiety: It's not easy.\n\nEven though I can't speak for my ex partners, I think I can safely say that watching your partner struggle with anxiety \u2014 especially untreated anxiety \u2014 is really tough. Although I'm just now able to admit this, I've actually struggled with anxiety since childhood. I remember having my first anxiety attack at my parents' dinner table when I was seven years old. Since then, I've had plenty more \u2014 and my exes were present for more than one of them.\n\n\n\nTo be clear, I don't think anxiety prevents me, or anyone else, from being a good partner. Actually, I think it's safe to say that I'm a damn good partner most of the time \u2014 and I feel like that's partially because of my anxiety rather than in spite of it. Anxious people are typically over-thinkers, which can be annoying, but it also means we're generally just naturally more considerate of other people's needs. That said, I'll be the first person to admit that dating someone with anxiety can be really hard sometimes \u2014 because no matter how irrational our anxiety is, you'll never be able to \"fix\" it.\n\nThe world is a much scarier place for someone with anxiety, and in turn, relationships \u2014 which are scary enough as is \u2014 can be scarier for us, too. Though I've written plenty of negative (but very true) things about my exes, I can't pretend dating someone with anxiety is always pleasant. So if your partner is anxious, then read on. Here's what you should know about dating someone with anxiety.\n\n1. Anxious People Don't Always Seem Anxious\n\n[Embed]\n\nAnxiety disorders are complicated, and they affect everyone differently. In my experience, though, even super-anxious people can seem mega chill much of the time. (Especially if they, like myself, prefer to use cannabis as a natural anxiety reliever.) But just because an anxious person is good at hiding their anxiety \u2014 or is fortunate enough to have days and even weeks at a time where their anxiety is manageable \u2014 doesn't mean their anxiety is gone.\n\nSince there's still such a stigma surrounding mental illness, most anxious people (like myself) have gotten really good at hiding their anxiety over years and years of practice. So even if an anxious person is freaking out on the inside, unless they know you super well, they're probably going to mask it. Don't make the mistake of thinking anxiety always has outward symptoms.\n\n2. Your Partner Might Not Be Ready To Accept They Have An Anxiety Disorder\n\n\n\n[Embed]\n\nLike I said, it's only been in the past year that I've started to accept that my anxiety isn't normal. Even now, there's still a part of me that doesn't want to accept this, because it makes me feel emotionally weak. Plus, I have lots of really good days. I still worry that the people I love will think I'm making it all up just to get attention, or that they'll think I've fabricated my anxiety disorder. In reality, though, these thoughts just further prove that I have a problem, because they're not based in fact. My family and friends have never said any of these things to me and they've actually been mostly supportive, but it's still work for me to believe that they aren't judging me.\n\nRemember that it's not your responsibility as a partner to force this realization, though. All you can do is be supportive, because ultimately, your partner is the only person responsible for their mental health.\n\n3. It\u2019s Definitely Not Anyone's Fault\n\n[Embed]\n\nPeople with anxiety don't choose to be anxious, but that doesn't make you responsible for their anxiety, either. I'm not saying there aren't ways you could be unintentionally, or even intentionally, contributing to your partner's anxiety. (For example, a few years back when my anxiety and depression had gotten pretty bad, one of my exes used to say to me, \"Nobody likes a crying girl.\" As you can imagine, that was unhelpful in many ways.)\n\nBut if your partner has anxiety, it's important for you to remember that their anxiety isn't about you. Unless you're just a total jerk, more often than not, your partner's anxiety is going to be completely unrelated to you and your relationship with them. Don't try to make it about you, because it's not uncommon for someone with anxiety to be anxious without even knowing why themselves.\n\n4. ... But You Should Try To Pay Attention To What Triggers Your Partner\n\n[Embed]\n\nAs we've established, anxiety isn't rational, so you shouldn't expect to understand why your partner is feeling anxious. However, you should try to be aware of any anxiety triggers your partner might have. Ask your partner if they know what sets them off. They might not know the answer to that question right now \u2014 either because they haven't even accepted that they have anxiety or because they're not very self-aware \u2014 but you should consider asking them.\n\nIf they know their triggers, then as their partner, you should know them, too. If they don't know their triggers, your sincere curiosity might encourage them to pay more attention to what triggers them in the future.\n\n5. Anxiety Can Be A Lifelong Struggle\n\n[Embed]\n\nYour partner's anxiety might be situational rather than chronic. Chronic or not, though, your partner's anxiety can absolutely be managed \u2014 through counseling, meditation, medication, exercise, diet, or all of the above. But anxiety is a real illness, so if you're dating someone with anxiety, don't expect them to be \"cured\" of it someday. Instead, understand that mental illnesses doesn't just disappear.\n\nPersonally, it's not uncommon for me to go so long without having an anxiety attack that I start to think I'll never have one again. I always do, though, so even if your partner seems OK for months at a time, know that this doesn't mean their struggle is over.\n\n6. For Some People, Anxiety & Depression Go Hand In Hand\n\n[Embed]\n\nIf your partner does suffer from anxiety and depression, they may not struggle with both of these illnesses simultaneously. (Personally, I tend to deal with anxiety daily whereas my depression is situational and not super severe.) Also, as we've already established, they may have long periods of time where they struggle with neither.\n\nAgain, none of this is your fault. Just be aware that anxiety and depression sometimes feed off of each other. So if your partner is anxious, they could be at risk for depression, too. Don't ever think it's your job to make them well, but do listen to them, because depression can be life-threatening.\n\n\n\n7. If You Can\u2019t Be Supportive, You Might Need To Leave \u2014 And That's OK\n\n[Embed]\n\nI would never encourage anyone to leave their partner just because they struggle with anxiety. That said, if your partner's anxiety is too much for you to handle right now, and you don't think you can stay with them without becoming unsupportive, then maybe you shouldn't be with them right now. I'm not saying it won't suck, because it will \u2014 but unless you can find a way to be supportive, you're not doing your partner any favors by staying with them. Know that it's OK to break up if that's what you need to be healthy and happy \u2014 because your needs matter, too.\n\nImages: Unsplash, Giphy/(7)", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/156415-the-one-thing-you-should-know-about-dating-someone-with-anxiety", "summary": "So if your partner is an anxious person, here's the one thing to know about dating someone with anxiety: It's not easy.\nTo be clear, I don't think anxiety prevents me, or anyone else, from being a good partner.\nIt\u2019s Definitely Not Anyone's Fault[Embed]People with anxiety don't choose to be anxious, but that doesn't make you responsible for their anxiety, either.\nAnxiety Can Be A Lifelong Struggle[Embed]Your partner's anxiety might be situational rather than chronic.\nBut anxiety is a real illness, so if you're dating someone with anxiety, don't expect them to be \"cured\" of it someday.", "timescraped": 1513838708.8366919, "category": {"words": 1313, "personal": 39, "thirdperson": 39, "condition": 53, "recovery": 0}}, "a21f7c3f0c55146dcfed64329a8923df": {"title": "This Student Took Chilling Photos To Show What Anxiety Feels Like", "image": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-03/23/12/campaign_images/webdr02/what-it-feels-like-2-12647-1458750239-3_dblbig.jpg", "text": "For her senior thesis, Crawford decided to make a photo series that would capture her experiences with depression and anxiety.

It has raised $20 million in venture capital.\n\nTruth in Advertising says Goop made these explicit and indirect claims both on its website and at its inaugural wellness summit in June.\n\nOn Tuesday, Truth in Advertising said that it had catalogued more than 50 instances of the e-commerce startup claiming that its products \u2014 along with outside products it promotes on its blog and in its newsletter \u2014 could treat, cure, prevent, alleviate, or reduce the risk of ailments such as infertility, depression, psoriasis, anxiety, and even cancer. \u201cThe problem is that the company does not possess the competent and reliable scientific evidence required by law to make such claims,\u201d the advocacy group wrote in a blog post.\n\nGwyneth Paltrow\u2019s Goop routinely draws criticism for its promotion of crystals, supplements, vaginal jade eggs, and all manner of other health products.

The day before the deadline, it said, it also provided a list of webpages with unsubstantiated claims. \u201cDespite being handed this information, Goop to date has only made limited changes to its marketing,\u201d the group wrote Tuesday.\n\nA Goop spokesperson told BuzzFeed News in a statement, \u201cGoop is dedicated to introducing unique products and offerings and encouraging constructive conversation surrounding new ideas.

Unfortunately, they provided limited information and made threats under arbitrary deadlines which were not reasonable under the circumstances.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, while we believe that TINA\u2019s description of our interactions is misleading and their claims unsubstantiated and unfounded, we will continue to evaluate our products and our content and make those improvements that we believe are reasonable and necessary in the interests of our community of users,\u201d the spokesperson added.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Goop has faced criticism of its marketing.

Although mental disorders are fairly common, many people are still hesitant to seek help or tell family and friends they're struggling. Luckily, the stigma is slowly being broken down and it's become a less taboo subject. Some of that taboo is thought to be tied to our lack of understanding of why mental health disorders exist, and why certain people develop them, while others do not. Although it's often difficult to specify the exact causes of mental illness, medical experts have weighed in with theories based on their research and work with patients.\n\nWe often hear the vague explanation that mental illnesses are typically caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. While this is certainly true in the majority of cases, it doesn't exactly dig deep and explain how genetics play a role or what type of environmental circumstances specifically put us at risk. As a therapist once told me, there are probably as many \"causes\" of mental illness and there are people suffering from them. But given that, these six possible causes may play a large role in many people's mental illnesses.\n\n1. Biology\n\n[Embed]\n\nAlthough biology does play a role in many mental illnesses, they're more deeply tied to specific disorders. Richard McNally, PhD, a clinical psychologist at Harvard University says: \"Certain disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism fit the biological model in a very clear-cut sense.\" In fact, structural and functional abnormalities can be seen in imaging scans and post-mortem dissections for individuals with these particular illnesses.\n\nBut the biological connection is less clear cut in other mental illnesses such as depression, anxiety, and eating disorders. Jerome Wakefield, PhD, DSW told the American Psychological Association Monitor On Psychology that, despite a huge amount of research, there's still no definitive proof that brain dysfunction is the root of mental illnesses. His concern is that other potential causes are being overlooked, specifically environmental, behavioral and social factors. \"If we focus only at the brain level, we are likely to miss a lot of what's going on in mental disorders,\" Wakefield told the APA.\n\n2. Prenatal Environment\n\nWhen we say environment plays a role, most of us automatically think about the environmental factors that affect people throughout their lives. But it's been shown that the prenatal environment can also play a significant role. Smoking during pregnancy has been linked to issues like ADHD, while a low birth weight due to malnutrition during the pregnancy creates a risk factor for mental disorders including depression, schizophrenia and ADHD. And exposure to gestational stress has been linked to anxiety, depression and ADHD.\n\n\n\n3. Lifestyle\n\nPeople who live in poverty are more likely to suffer from mental illness due to the intense amount of stress caused by a low income level. In fact, mental disorders are twice as common amongst the poor compared to the wealthy. It creates a vicious cycle, because those coping with a severe mental illness will often have a harder time networking and job hunting. This means they're less likely to have insurance and therefore they'll be unable to get the professional help they need and deserve. And, although schizophrenia has been identified as one of the most biologically based disorders, individuals with the lowest socioeconomic levels are eight times more likely to suffer from the illness than those in the highest income bracket \u2014 which illustrates that biology is rarely the only factor at play.\n\n\n\nAlthough poverty appears to be the most common way lifestyle affects mental illness, it's not the only example. Smoking, lack of physical activity, chronic physical illness, social isolation, and unhealthy sleeping patterns can all play a role \u2014 especially if more than one of these apply to the patient's life. And they could be enough to trigger an individual who's already at risk for mental illness due to genetics, environment, abuse, or all of the above.\n\n4. Exposure To Toxic Substances & Head Injuries\n\nExposure to toxic substances can cause a variety of health issues \u2014 migraines, headaches, memory problems, and cognitive dysfunction are a few examples. According to the National Institute of Health, \"disruption of brain function may also manifest as subtle or overt alteration in thoughts, moods, or behaviors.\" Although there hasn't been much research about the link between mental illness and exposure to toxins, it's now on the radar of doctors and mental health professionals \u2014 so hopefully more information and studies will be available soon.\n\n\n\nInjuries in certain areas of brain are also linked to mental illness. This possible cause was first brought into the public eye when questions were raised about how repeated head injuries in football players could affect their overall health. But recent research has shown that even one head injury increases a person's risk of developing a mental illness \u2014 especially if the injury occurred during adolescence. In fact, researchers at University of Copenhagen found that, for individuals who had suffered head injuries, the risk factor for schizophrenia increased by 65 percent and the risk for depression increased by 59 percent.\n\n5. Genetics\n\nMental illness is more common amongst individuals who have a relative with a mental disorder compared to those who don't \u2014 but it doesn't automatically mean that you'll develop the illness as well. According to recent research, approximately 90 percent of individuals with bipolar disorder have a family member with depression. If a person has a relative with depression, he or she is five times more likely to develop the illness as well. The best research about how genetics affect depression comes from studying twins because they share the exact same genetic code. When twins are raised together and one develops depression, the other will also become clinically depressed 76 percent of the time. When raised apart, they'll both develop depression 67 percent of the time. So, although genetics undoubtedly play a role, the twins studies prove that there have to be other factors at play \u2014 otherwise these percentages would jump to 100 percent regardless of whether the twins were raised together or apart.\n\nAnd, growing up in a household where a parent has mental illness can cause intense stress, which is another trigger for mental problems. For example, children with mentally ill parents may become neglected, have to take on the role of caregiver for their parent, or be embarrassed by their home situation. Furthermore, illnesses like depression and anxiety can be a \"learned\" behavior \u2014 children in these households may grow up thinking it's normal to spend full days sleeping, use unhealthy coping mechanisms, and become extremely anxious over a variety of situations.\n\n\n\n6. Abuse & Traumatic Experiences\n\nPhysical abuse, sexual abuse, and other traumatic experiences are, of course, the cause of PTSD. While most sufferers can recover from PTSD with the right treatment, they may continue to live with an anxiety disorder or depression. And while not everyone who experiences a trauma has PTSD, they're still at a great risk for mental illness than those who haven't lived through a trauma, because any sort of intense stress creates a risk factor for depression.\n\nChildhood abuse is the trauma that's most strongly linked to depression. A small hippocampus is a sign of chronic stress and recent studies have shown that small hippocampus volume could be seen in depressed women who had experienced a childhood trauma. It was not seen in depressed patients who hadn't experienced a trauma during childhood, which illustrates that the reasons people develop mental for a variety of reasons. It was further evidenced by which forms of treatment were most effective. Depressed individuals with a history of trauma responded better to psychotherapy, while those who didn't have abuse in their past responded to a combination of antidepressants and therapy.\n\nImages: Pexels (1; 2; 3; 4); Giphy (2)", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/174560-6-possible-causes-of-mental-illness", "summary": "According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, approximately one in five adults experience mental illness in a given year, with the most common mental illnesses being anxiety disorders (which include generalized anxiety, PTSD, OCD, and specific phobias).\nAs a therapist once told me, there are probably as many \"causes\" of mental illness and there are people suffering from them.\nIt creates a vicious cycle, because those coping with a severe mental illness will often have a harder time networking and job hunting.\nAlthough poverty appears to be the most common way lifestyle affects mental illness, it's not the only example.\nAnd, growing up in a household where a parent has mental illness can cause intense stress, which is another trigger for mental problems.", "timescraped": 1513838696.5595362, "category": {"words": 1339, "personal": 6, "thirdperson": 19, "condition": 41, "recovery": 1}}, "ecdaacbe162d94a8ab3f18da31287371": {"title": "When To Disclose Your Mental Illness To Someone You're Dating", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost%2F2016%2F9%2F13%2F0128f651-74b4-44b2-ba76-2034542b9f12.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "text": "There are several different challenges when it comes to dating while mentally ill. The big one, though, is the disclosure problem: when do you disclose your mental illness to someone you're dating, particularly if you're just casual? Is there a set timeline? A social point after which it's a faux pas? An etiquette guide? (That'd be very useful, actually: The Official Guide To Manners In A Life Of Mental Disorder.)\n\nIt turns out that the expert answers tend to vary by particular case and by severity of disorder; there are general guidelines, but overall, the specific timing is up to you. And remember that it's normal to feel a bit of trepidation; the mental health discrimination organization Time To Change has found that a whopping 75 percent of people with mental disorders felt scared to tell new partners about it. The caution is understandable. Myths about mental disorders, romantic and otherwise, abound; people who introduce the fact of their diagnosis fear rejection by somebody cute, or being pegged as \"crazy\" and \"undateable\".\n\nThe right person, it should go without saying, will accept you and work with your diagnosis; the National Association for Mental Illness (NAMI) even points out that disclosure is a plus in relationships, helping \"a supportive partner... feel closer to the person after they learn of their mental illness ... it can be an opportunity to grow together through the disclosure.\" If a person denigrates your condition or refuses to engage with or understand it, needless to say, they need to be kicked to the curb or re-educated, sharpish.\n\nHere are some things to think about when it comes to when to disclose your mental illnesses to someone you're dating.\n\n1. When It Influences Your Behavior\n\nThis is a piece of advice based around disorders that have distinct phases, rather than unilateral characteristics: depression that comes in waves, for instance, or anxiety that's triggered by particular stimuli. It's important to raise your mental illness, according to this way of thinking, when it starts to actively change your behavior within the relationship. For instance, Health Central gives a scenario in which a person with an anxiety disorder is invited on a date to a crowded space in which they would be at risk of panic attacks. That acts as a spur to disclosure; it requires negotiation and plan-changing with a date, and therefore your mental health needs to be on the table.\n\n\n\nBut this isn't as simple as it seems. People with long-standing disorders often note that many aspects of their behavior are affected by it, and that it forms part of who they are. \"When it influences your behavior,\" in that case, is \"always,\" and there isn't one particular \"flaring\" moment in which the symptoms become more or less noticeable.\n\n2. ... Or When You're Not In A Disorder Phase\n\nThis may seem like it contradicts what I just said, but the first point is about warning: many sufferers can begin to feel themselves entering a phase of disorder (a darkening of mood, for instance), and should warn any partners about what's about to happen as soon as they can. If you have the luxury, though, organizations like NAMI suggest that it's best to \"talk about it during a calm time when you're not actively struggling with an episode of anxiety, depression, psychosis, or mania,\" as it will help you explain things clearly and respond to their concerns. Some people may worry that this makes their condition seem less believable to their date, but a person who doesn't believe you when you say you're diagnosed with a mental illness is not somebody you should be spending movie nights with.\n\n3. When You Reach A \"Serious\" Stage\n\nAs far as advice on disclosure goes, this is one of the most common tips: that you definitely need to disclose if things are becoming \"serious,\" though how that's defined is up to you (sleeping together, seeing each other multiple times a week, calling each other \"partner\" or \"girlfriend,\" whatever). Psychologist Barbara Greenberg, for example, interviewed on the question by Mic, says disclosure should occur \"whenever the relationship has matured to the point where it feels comfortable \u2014 usually, around the three-month mark.\"\n\n\n\nThis length of time does guarantee that you and your partner are well-acquainted, and there are benefits to long-term dating before you disclose; NAMI says that the value of waiting before telling them lies in the fact that \"your partner probably already appreciates the personality qualities that have helped you live well despite a mental health condition. By sharing your health history,\" they add, \"you share insight into not just your challenges but also your strengths.\"\n\n\"Serious,\" though, is relative. If you feel you can't enter into a sexual relationship with somebody, introduce them to your friends, or take them past any relationship \"mark\" that hits before three months without telling them about your disorder, that's a very valid feeling. You know your condition best.\n\n4. When It Feels Safe\n\nThe notions of \"comfortable\" and \"safe\" are discussed a lot when it comes to mental illness disclosure in intimate relationships; that's what lies behind the three-month mark idea, but it could also be more subtle than a timeline allows. Safety, in this context, is usually the result of building trust, evaluating their reactions, and knowing with relative certainty that they won't throw a fit or decide that you're a flawed lunatic and run off into the sunset.\n\n\n\nI would love to feel I could keep my mental illness under wraps until I was comfortable with someone, as if it were a hobby like collecting international Barbie dolls,\" writes Molly Pohlig, who suffers from various disorders including borderline personality disorder and depression . \"But that seems both unfair and dangerous. Having a panic attack in front of someone unprepared is not great for building trust.\" In those cases, being upfront early isn't just polite, it's necessary. There is, as always, a caveat. For some people, their disorders are sufficiently intrusive that waiting until safety has been achieved is not feasible, or indeed particularly cool for their partner. \"\n\n5. When They Ask\n\nSometimes these things just come up naturally. If a date wants to know what's going on, if you're all right, and why you haven't answered their calls for three days, now is the time to give up the truth. Or maybe they just reveal their own issues over tacos on a particularly revealing date, and give you the opening to reveal your own. Either way, if it comes up, it is extremely important not to lie.\n\nStatistics are on your side when it comes to disclosure; the mental health organization Mind explains that, according to a large survey, two-thirds of people with mental health issues and partners described their partner's reactions to disclosure as \"unfazed\" and \"really understanding\" and that only five percent of all the surveyed subjects, with or without partners, had dates break up with them when disclosure happened.\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIf you're struggling, look at it from the perspective of the person you're dating.

They keep you feeling safe during in-patient mental health treatment. \"I have a stuffed bear named, quite creatively, Teddy, that I've had since I was 2 or 3. The funny thing is that he came from a flea market and was already well loved when I got him, but he was (and is) the favorite of my multitude of stuffed animals. Despite being a college student and 'adult' I still sleep with him most nights. I had a really rough time battling mental illnesses and persistent suicidal thoughts during high school, which led to several inpatient visits at behavioral health hospitals and a six-month placement for residential treatment during high school. My teddy bear provided me with comfort and a sense of security. I still sleep with him and several other stuffed animals at night and I am so reluctant to part with any of my stuffed animals, as they were such a big part of my childhood and they all have names and personalities, so it would be like saying goodbye forever to a close childhood friend.\" \u2014elliem47c8e0f45 Share On email Share On email\n\nShare On link Share On link Share This Link\n\nShare On facebook Share On facebook Share\n\n6.

It was sunny yellow when I was brought home from the hospital in it, and it used to be big enough to cover my entire body until about 4 years old. Now, it\u2019s a tied-up ball of pieces of blanket and acrylic edging. I\u2019m 35 now, and I still sleep with it every night. When I\u2019m super stressed I hold and smell it and play with the edging. I\u2019ve recently been diagnosed with lupus and the last year-and-a-half has been super hard. I\u2019ve been holding and smelling it more than in past years. I\u2019ve even taken it to doc appointments and ER visits if I\u2019m scared. My husband will even bring it to me without asking because he knows it helps. It brings me so much comfort.

They're a sleep aid when you need certain sensory objects to drift off. \"As an adult with ADHD, sensory objects have become very necessary when trying to sleep every night.

They're perfect for crying into when you feel an anxiety or depression spiral coming on. \"I have a stuffed bear that is about the size of my torso.

It's the only thing I own that has survived three college dorms, countless road trips with my parents, and eight moves, including two that were out of state/halfway across the country. Every time I feel myself having an anxiety attack or spiraling into a depressive episode, I cuddle it and usually cry it out in a dark room.

He smells like lavender, and can be microwaved to become a heat pack. I have generalized anxiety disorder, and he helps calm me down when I'm anxious. I brought him with me the first time I donated blood because I was afraid of needles (that experience helped me conquer my fear of needles). I also brought him to my last day of phlebotomy school to bring me good luck and comfort during my final. He's weighted, so the pressure provides me comfort at night if I'm having a tough time.

I haven\u2019t slept without it a day since I got it, even when I\u2019ve gone to professional conferences sharing hotels, sharing beds with partners, staying in hospitals, etc. It\u2019s just a part of who I am.

Living with PMDD is almost like being two different people. For a few weeks, I'm my happy self \u2014 proactive, and willing to deal with people and stressful situations. Then, the week or two before my period, the bad feelings start to creep in. Being overwhelmed by EVERY. LITTLE. THING. I begin to feel worthless and like a burden to everyone around me. I become short-tempered and volatile. And all of those feelings are rationalized by my mind, which has been taken over by PMDD. \u2014dreac4af261fdf\n\n3. I am usually a happy-go-lucky person, but my PMDD turns me into an irritable, emotional, angry, and anxious person. PMDD makes it so much harder to concentrate at work. Every little thing sets me off into a crying frenzy. \u2014bcritters110292\n\n4. I find myself getting irrationally angry to the point of wanting to quit my job, fight with my husband over the teeniest things, or end friendships that have gone on for 10 years. Then I get disappointed in myself for letting myself get that angry, the depression and anxiety kick in, and I feel like the most worthless human being ever. Medication has helped some, but tracking my period has helped a lot because if I know it\u2019s coming, I can tell myself to chill out. \u2014meganl26\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. The worst part about PMDD is the monthlong experience of dissociation from reality. The most dangerous part is the urge to make semi-major decisions, like confronting my housemate about their mildly irritating behavior and threatening to move out, to the more major prospect of leaving my job or uprooting myself in some other way. My periods are neither painful nor heavy, but the emotional toll often leaves me feeling like there's no way out and no end to the mental unrest. \u2014jacquia48cdf3548\n\n7. I was diagnosed with PMDD about eight years ago. Everything made sense after that. I\u2019d quit my jobs, start relationships, end relationships, and all kinds of other destructive stuff. Then I would get my period a few hours later and be left with a new crazy situation to get myself out of. It\u2019s still pretty bad but knowing what\u2019s going on really helps me to control my behavior. \u2014cheyannereeseh\n\n8. I\u2019m tired of being seen as a bitch or people thinking I have control over it. I literally feel like a monster when it happens. \u2014jaclyna463203074\n\n9. My PMDD is a monster. In college, even on birth control, my rage over everything around me would leave me buzzing and unable to sit still. Suicidal thoughts became so routine that I became apathetic. I would scream and cry and break things. At its worst, I would have maybe a week to a week and a half of normalcy before it started all over again. \u2014kilaf\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. The best way I can describe PMDD is two weeks of tremendous emotional and mental pain every single month. \u2014brettfosterb\n\n12. I feel totally out of control with my PMDD. I pick crazy insane fights with my spouse, experience intense rage at work (both always followed by extreme guilt that makes me break down and cry), and at its worst there were times I considered self-harm out of sheer frustration and depression. I feel foggy and angry 24/7. I noticed a drastic improvement when I got on NuvaRing and now I'm on Nexplanon which has been amazing. Not only are my moods easier but I don't even bleed anymore (I do get other symptoms like bloating and regular PMS mood stuff, but I've saved a fortune in tampons!! hahaha). \u2014grumpypumpkin\n\n13. When I have PMDD, I feel like I'm going completely insane. I get so angry, cry at every little thing, and get lots of suicidal thoughts. I call the doctor, and we set up an appointment that always ends up being after my period has started. By the time of my visit, I feel and seem normal again and it's really hard to explain my symptoms, so they're often dismissed as normal or \"having a bad week.\" \u2014helenkatherinevalentineh\n\n14. I began dealing with PMDD after the birth of my daughter. It started out as postpartum depression and once the pregnancy hormones changed it became a monthly battle for my life. The day before my period was the worst \u2014 I would lie on my couch crying for hours, feeling completely useless and drained. My hormones were so out of whack that I would fall into a deep hole mentally and emotionally in which I'd feel like nothing could pull me out. I even began to have suicidal ideations every single month. Luckily over the past two years I have been able to manage the emotional side of my PMDD through therapy and medication. \u2014kristenb58\n\nAdvertisement\n\n15. For me, my PMDD started after I had my second baby. Every month I would feel self-loathing and question my choice to have children. I\u2019d regret so many of my life choices and spend as much time in my bed as possible. Then my period would start and I would feel AMAZING. \u2014gretchent4906afb19\n\n16. It's hard to decide which is worse. There's the week of extreme sound sensitivity, uncontrollable rage, and a strong desire to be left alone. But that's followed by a week of despair. Crying over nothing, not being able to do things because you just don't have the energy, losing all interest in the things you love. And the last three days in particular, you drop so low that you're sure you can never recover. All of a sudden you feel nothing, and you'd think it would be a relief but it's not \u2014 it feels worse. Guilt and sadness all over again and then poof! Periods starts and you're a normal human. Congratulations: You've got two weeks until it all happens again. \u2014hotmessmama\n\n17. My mood flips like crazy. I don't even know how to properly describe it, but one moment I feel the urge to hurt someone who slightly inconvenienced me, and a minute later I want to walk up to them with tears in my eyes and apologize on my hands and knees for my thoughts. \u2014ashleyg4154a69ac\n\n18. I used to think that's just what PMS was \u2014 that I was one of \"those girls\" who turned crazy before her period. I cried in relief when I learned that PMDD was a thing. I get severe mental breakdowns, worsening depression, and crazy mood swings, and my suicidal thoughts return more horrible than ever. It doesn't let me function, and it has ruined relationships in the past and more recently. \u2014j4681832a4\n\n19. During the two weeks leading up to my period, everything feels \"off\" and I don't mean that I get moody, or weepy (though that does happen). What I mean is that the whole world physically and mentally looks and feels different. It's almost like being a different person, or being in an alternate universe. Everything is familiar, but nothing feels right. It's all off a few clicks, and interacting with people is a nightmare. \u2014ecocrafty\n\nAdvertisement\n\n20. Besides the crazy mood swings and exaggerated PMS symptoms like SEVERE bloating in the two weeks prior to my period, I also get debilitating joint pain from the hormone fluctuations. It can be so hard to manage symptoms and balance work, family, and relationships. But, for what it's worth, what helps me the most is a solid self-care routine. Managing PMDD is the hardest thing I have ever been faced with, but at the end of the day I feel like facing it and controlling it is my secret superpower. Because every day that I live with PMDD and manage not to let my life go up in flames is a huge accomplishment. \u2014btamang0101\n\n21. When my PMDD kicks in I feel nothing like myself. I\u2019m irrational, anxious, and sometimes so depressed that I either become catatonic or have suicidal ideation. The worst is that you know that none of that is very \u201cyou\u201d at all, but you can\u2019t stop any of it. It affects my relationship, has affected school and work, and friendships. It interferes with every possible aspect of my life that it can. \u2014brookeashleys2\n\n23. My PMDD starts a week before my period. It usually consists of extreme breast tenderness, severe depression and anxiety, intense mood swings, nausea, and suicidal tendencies. Living with PMDD has made it difficult to go to work, socialize with friends, and even establish romantic relationships. \u2014alexiaa4b43024da\n\n24. I\ufe0f had gone through therapy on and off for a year before being diagnosed with PMDD. I\ufe0f never felt like depression fit me as a diagnosis because it wasn\u2019t all-consuming...except for the 7 to 10 days before my period. PMDD is so scary and powerful that it manipulates me into believing my happy relationship needs to end or that I\ufe0f am worthless. These things are not true, but when PMDD hits, I\ufe0f am blinded by a smoke screen of doubt and insecurities. I\ufe0f now strongly channel the work I\u2019ve done in therapy into reminding myself of the \u201cwhy\u201d behind my actions. The \u201cwhy\u201d is PMDD and it\u2019s not who I\ufe0f am. \u2014alyssaw421bed8ba\n\n25. Every month with PMDD is like having something in you that \"switches\" and you can't recognize yourself anymore. I start behaving impulsively, I start to push important people out of my life, and I get urges to hurt myself. It's so twisted because once my period starts, I realize every negative thing I did while I was suffering for those two weeks, and then have to pick up the pieces and deal with the aftermath. \u2014olivias4d8b40b8b\n\n27. I will start by getting slightly more irritated, which I shrug off as normal anxiety, until I wake up one morning with so much pressure in my chest. And for no reason at all, I\u2019m not happy. I\u2019m full of anxiety which turns into me becoming incredibly irritable and I have absolutely no control over it. It takes so much energy out of me, and I spend that entire time trying to keep my emotions in check, because I don\u2019t want to hurt my family by being an emotionally charged psychopath. \u2014meganw470d69a30\n\n28. For me, PMDD brings with it \u2014 among other things \u2014 loads of paranoia and irrational thinking (though at the time, it all feels extremely real). It makes me question everything in my life, especially the people in my life and my relationships with them, and as a result I\ufe0f end up lashing out at them and (attempting) to isolate myself. \u2014lillyl4a693c095\n\n29. Living with PMDD is like being sane for two weeks, loving life, people, stopping to smell the roses, and enjoying everything. Then it hits you. You wake up one morning and you hate the world. You have this uncontrollable rage and you snap at everyone and start fights. Mix that in with severe anxiety that makes you believe everything is going to go wrong, replaying in your head over and over all night long. Then also add in some massive depression. You don\u2019t want to get out of bed or talk to anyone. There\u2019s a little voice in your head that follows you around all day telling you what a horrible person you are and that nobody likes you and you can\u2019t do anything right. And that if you disappeared, nobody would care. You cry constantly, yell all the time, and are constantly tired and bloated. And then your period comes and the world is beautiful again. And it starts all over. Again. EVERY MONTH! Sounds fun doesn\u2019t it? \u2014michelled428840298\n\nWant help looking and feeling your best? Sign up for our Health & Beauty newsletter! Sign up Great!

I was out shopping. Suddenly the lights seemed too bright, everything started to pulse slightly and I felt really nauseated. I ended up falling to my knees and fainting in the mother-and-baby aisle of a pharmacy. Winningly, when I came round I was covered in boxes of breast pumps. I had several \"episodes\" after that, but because they were so physiological I didn't realised they were panic attacks until my doctor diagnosed me with panic disorder. By then, though, I was deep in a spiral of anxiety and soon I couldn't leave the house without fainting. I had developed severe agoraphobia. The anxiety was so constant that I couldn't eat so I lost two stone. I experimented abortively with antidepressants, started psychotherapy, and embarked on a gruelling programme of deliberately going into situations that induced panic attacks on a daily basis to try and inure myself against them. In total it took me four years and two relapses to get to a point where I could go back to work. But it worked. I now travel freely and haven't experienced an acute panic attack for years, although I do suffer with depression and generalised anxiety. Personally, I found knowing what's physically happening during an attack, some useful hacks \u2013 plus being aware of the fact that it will pass \u2013 helped me to get through an attack.\n\nBut what I could really have used back then were other people's experiences of panic and anxiety, and knowing that I wasn't on my own in this struggle. So that's why I collated these stories for anyone who might be going through something similar. \u2013Robyn Wilder\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt feels as if the world is rushing at me. Noises become very pronounced and it makes my head swim. Sometimes I can find it difficult to focus, sometimes I feel disoriented. My heart rate soars and I become very aware of my breathing. I sometimes have pins and needles in my hands or a sudden tension across my shoulders. Other times I feel an intense bolt of fear, which makes me want to move away but roots me to the spot. My attacks pass quickly but arrive with no warning. I know they go away eventually, so this takes a little of the edge off the attacks. \u2013Miranda Dickinson\n\nIt's varied at different times in my life. I remember being a teenager in a Game store, and I didn't feel panicked at all, but suddenly I just couldn't see. Then, of course, I panicked! I sat down outside and things went back to normal, but that was pretty terrifying for a while. At other times I know what's set me off \u2013 stress and worrying, thoughts racing, not being able to get out of your own little bubble even though you know that's what you're doing. Or some emotional trauma. I think \"panic attack\" is a misnomer. It suggests the panic is what starts it off, but the panic itself can result from something unidentified, too. \u2013Marianne\n\nAfter 25 years of dealing, I have tried to explain this to a fair few people. Some people think \"anxiety\" means \"worrying\", but my attacks manifest with very pronounced physical effects \u2013 vertigo, shaking, a racing pulse and lightheadedness. \u2013Anonymous\n\nIt doesn't creep up on me, I'm just right in the middle of it before I know it and it's kind of too late then. It's hot and feels like I'm going to pass out, and I just need to get out of wherever I currently am. Usually a train carriage. I can normally tell it's a panic attack afterwards because once I've established that I'm \"safe\" or out of wherever it was that I was, I feel the same \u2013 cold sweat, heart beating really fast, and basically a sense that I want to be crying and not visible. But I've come to recognise how I feel and when it's a panic attack happening. I can sort of talk myself down from it, at least for long enough so I can get myself somewhere safe and relaxed. \u2013Sam Grey\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI remember my first panic attack very well. I was going through a difficult breakup and had just landed at Heathrow. I was walking along and suddenly the lights seemed very bright and it seemed like there were an awful lot of people. I felt tiny and vulnerable, like any one of those people could harm me if they wanted to. My knees turned to jelly immediately and I collapsed sobbing on the side of the corridor. I was hyperventilating and I thought I was dying. It came out of nowhere and I had never experienced anything like it before. From that time onward I began to worry constantly about every small detail of life, from the moment I left the house. I'd be waiting at the bus stop having internal conversations with myself about what position I was in in the queue and what would happen if I couldn't get on the bus \u2013 I'd be late and lose my job and be totally screwed. All of that stuff happened first thing in the morning, every morning, and continued for every small detail you can imagine throughout the day, so I stopped going out except for work. What works for me is to accept that I am having a panic attack, to notice and acknowledge the way I feel without judging it to be bad, to breathe the way my body seems to want to breathe for any given breath, and to think about what triggers in the environment might have contributed to the way that I feel in the moment. I now accept panic as part of my own normal range of reactions to certain things, and for me that has been the key to living a more normal life. When I think back to even my childhood I was always a worrier and experienced a lot of anxiety without really identifying it as such. So, while I still feel panicked sometimes, I don't beat myself up about it, which is what previously made things worse. \u2013Angel Belsey\n\nMy heart feels like it trying to push its way out of my chest and the world around me blurs. I often feel like I'm dying and it hurts to breathe. I sometimes hear a pulsing in my head, which seems to flow through my entire body. I always cry and need to pace around, which probably just makes it worse. I've recently had a number of attacks at work. These have been followed by me feeling sure everyone thinks I'm insane leading to shame and embarrassment. One of my attacks led me to faint, waking up 20 minutes later in a disabled toilet with a pounding headache and no knowledge of where I was. \u2013@montagmildred\n\nThe first time I had a panic attack I immediately thought I was having a heart attack. My heartbeat just escalated from nowhere and my thoughts straightaway were that I was going to die and either needed to get to a hospital or, that if it was true that I was going to die, I needed to do it somewhere where it wasn't going to be public and embarrassing (this was at a Blur gig in Birmingham NEC so my options were limited). A lot of it was to do with embarrassing myself in public, to be honest. Even once I'd realised panic attacks probably wouldn't kill me, being sick in public was definitely a fear. And, though I was told that if I hyperventilated the worst thing that would happen is that I'd faint, the idea of fainting in public was so embarrassing that it just made it worse. The \"comedown\" (that doesn't seem an appropriate word but can't think of a better one) which follows an attack is almost as bad as the attack itself. A dreadful fusion of depression, exhaustion, despair, self-pity, and humiliation. Urgh. Eventually got diagnosed with acute generalised anxiety disorder. As I started to feel a bit better and the idea of possibly being able to socialise again loomed, I knew that the only way it could possibly happen was to confront the panic attacks and anxiety, and get out there. \u2013Gina\n\nYou have a constant feeling of unease. Like a haze at the back of your head and a prickling in the middle of your chest. It's OK. You're used to it. Most of the time it's background noise. Then suddenly, for some reason or no reason at all, the prickles in your chest get sharper and your head gets foggier. Your heart pounds faster as it tries to defend itself from impending danger and your breathing becomes shallow as you desperately try to get air into your body and your brain. Your throat constricts and your chest contracts and your heart almost bursts from your chest and your head is hammering and you try to grasp onto something, anything, to keep you tethered and whole. Your entire body is feeling everything and nothing all at once and you just want to jump out of your skin, get away from this feeling, get it away from yourself. Get yourself back. \u2013Jenna Guillaume\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPanic attacks for me are like really heightened version of feeling anxious. I can feel it building up, going from feeling anxious and jittery with all the feelings that go with that to the point where I can't physically cope with how I'm feeling. I start by having very clear, defined, worried thoughts and then my brain starts going fuzzy, because I'm thinking so fast that I can't keep hold of it. Then my heart starts going really fast, like it's buzzing or humming rather than beating. You know the feeling you get when you miss a step going downstairs? Well, it's like someone hollows out my entire chest and replaces it with that feeling with this crazy buzzing heart in the middle. I tend to get waves of hot and cold nausea going over me alternately at this point, which makes me spontaneously sweat like crazy, and my stomach twists and my hands shake. I feel like I can't breathe and I become dizzy and lightheaded. I can't keep upright when it gets to this stage \u2013 I feel like all the blood drains from my face and I worry I'm going to faint or collapse. \u2013Amy\n\nMy first attack was seven years ago. I simply woke up, thought about going to work, and then it felt like a huge blanket fell over me and started suffocating me. I didn't understand what was happening, and started crying because the thought of trying to get up and go to work, face people and pretend it was all OK simply felt like the most terrifying thing in the world. I called my GP and he calmed me down a little and said to rest a bit and if I feel better after, come and see the specialist they had. The psychiatrist I went to see later that day was very supportive and explained to me what was happening. I was suffering from mild depression at that time but this was something else, the whole thing felt really extreme. \u2013Anonymous\n\nI was sitting my finals at university. While reading the questions, I briefly contemplated the possibility of failing the paper, and that's when the panic attack hit. I felt my boxer shorts go wet. I didn't piss myself, I \"sweated myself\"...or rather, I \"cold-sweated myself\". Breathing got erratic and I started losing balance while still seated. I remember dropping my pen on the desk, closing my eyes and trying to tell myself that it was going to be OK. I pressed my index fingers onto my shut eyelids and massaged my eyeballs. When I'd calmed down a bit, I went to the bathroom, rinsed my face...and that's about it I think. \u2013Khalil A. Cassimally\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am drowning. It doesn't matter where I was a few seconds ago; maybe I was doing some work in my office, maybe I was walking through a crowded subway station, or maybe I was just hanging out at home \u2013 but now I feel like I'm under 1,000 feet of water. I notice the physical signs first. My heart is beating too heavily, its rhythm somehow irregular but much too fast. The muscles in my arms and legs tense painfully, my hands begin to shake, suddenly I forget how to breathe. Each breath is a struggle, each inhale or exhale more difficult than the last. The outside world crashes into my consciousness. Even with my eyes shut and my head in my hands, every perception is completely overwhelming. There are entirely too many things happening all at once. Every thought is pervaded by an overwhelming feeling of failure. At the bottom, I can't see outside the panic and the panic seems to last for an eternity. But then slowly, very slowly, everything recedes and I'm left dreading the next attack. \u2013Anonymous\n\nWhen I have an attack I feel like my brain has left my body, the two just do not connect. I feel like I'm floating and then the stuttering starts. I just can't get a coherent sentence out. Then, my brain goes into \"spiderweb\" mode \u2013 a million thoughts, mostly panicky, just start rolling and spreading. All this happens while I'm trying to speak and just stuttering sounds are coming out. God, these are the worst. They usually last for about 10 minutes. I have to try to calm myself down, which feels impossible. But there is always an end in sight. My panic attacks are usually brought on by agoraphobia. For a very long time, I would avoid crowded places. With medication, I've managed to keep this under control for the past tow years. They still happen, but a lot less frequently. \u2013Erica\n\nEverything is usually fine. I can be sat talking with a friend about nothing in particular or reading a book on the train or walking or something. Then suddenly I become hyper vigilant. I'm instantaneously aware of everything and everyone in the world and all of it is a threat. Everything is so clear, so bright, so harsh, and so defined it's as though it is in high definition. My legs respond instantly to this new reality and they feel bowed. I can be sitting or even lying down but the weakness in my legs will always come. They feel incredibly light and tingly. It's a floaty feeling that perhaps I could enjoy, if I wasn't starting to shake and if everything didn't seem so artificially bright and smooth and defined. On rare occasions my mouth starts to fill with the sour water you get when you're going to throw up. Sometimes, a less severe form of panic attack occurs where I just get a very tight chest, a pain shooting through my sternum, but none of the other accompanying feelings of fear and helplessness. Most of the time though, I'm just quaking, my throat tight, my legs rubbery, and all the while I'm struggling to breath properly and looking around trying to find a way out. (I'm usually triggered by \"confined spaces\" but the meaning of that term can vary from lifts and train carriages to the cinema or a lecture theatre.) It takes about 20 minutes for the physical symptoms to subside and within an hour they're gone completely. Emotionally though, I'm usually a wreck for at least the rest of the day. I feel ashamed and sad and still a little bit scared for a while but eventually it subsides. \u2013Anonymous\n\nThe worst symptom was what felt like electric voltage coursing through me from head to toe. When I would wake a little and remember all the things I had to do that day, my brain would taser me with what I suspect was a fight-or-flight response, and my heart would explode and my body would feel tingly. Only years later when I tried anti-anxiety pills did I realise that shouldn't be part of my day. Where some people would get butterflies in their stomach, I had them in my chest. They would crop up when my heart would begin to race, and trying to cajole them into calming down so I could nap (or just fall asleep in general) was like trying to wrestle a monster that exploded into 1,000 pieces. It took ages to trick my heart into slowing down with various attempts of muscle relaxation and deep breathing. It was all uphill and made me feel so completely helpless. The only way to circumvent the feelings in public were to always, always sit on the edge of a row in lectures or in a movie theatre or plane. Otherwise I was toast. \u2013Anonymous\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhysically it starts with my heart rate skyrocketing, I start have trouble breathing, not like I'm suffocating but just feeling like I can't take a big enough breath to get the air I need. I get sensitive to touch, like I feel that my muscles are weaker like when you have a flu. And the biggest part is the rush of what I think is adrenaline. It's that feel like if you've ever been in a car accident that you get RIGHT before the collision, when you see it coming. Or when you first start to fall while riding a roller-coaster. \u2013Anonymous\n\nI was at work, doing a mundane task and not thinking about much of anything, when I started to have trouble breathing. When I tried to take a breath, it felt like my lungs were already full. This had happened before and I'd been able to get it under control, so I just tried to relax. But this time it was getting worse, and I wasn't getting enough air. I went into a meeting. After a few minutes, I started to feel faint and shaky. I started to feel like my heart was fluttering, like the beats were irregular. I'd never felt that way before. I made eye contact with my boss and asked him to call me an ambulance. It still hadn't occurred to me this might be a panic or anxiety attack. When I arrived at the hospital I'd already started to feel better. The doctors monitored my ECG and took chest x-rays, but eventually discharged me, telling me only that they couldn't find anything wrong. No one ever told me that what I experienced was an anxiety or panic attack, but based on the questions the medical staff asked me I knew that was their leading theory, and I'm almost certain that's what happened. What's most surprising to me is that, while I had been going through a stressful time, the cause of that extra stress \u2013 a large event I'd been helping to organise \u2013 had come to an end days before my attack. I've learned since that it's not unheard of for people to have attacks after the actual triggering incident has passed, but at the time it didn't make any sense. I wasn't consciously aware of being anxious about anything! I didn't even feel particularly anxious during the attack. It felt completely physical; like something was being inflicted upon my body. Like my mind was calm, but my heart and lungs and limbs were having the attack on their own. \u2013Chris Tindal\n\nGenerally they begin with shortness of breath. Breathing starts being something that I have to actively control. This is the make-or-break point. If I can regulate my breathing and bring myself back down to earth, I'm usually in the clear. I'll try breathing exercises, pound a huge cup of chamomile tea, or, if I'm lucky enough to have one on hand, take a Xanax. As often as not, though, things begin to spiral out of control. Next comes the lack of focus and lightheadedness, where all of my attention is focused inward. All of my mental resources are devoted to what's happening in my head. I can't read at this point, I can't focus on TV, and I can't hold a conversation. Worst is if it happens while I'm driving; all I can do is try to keep an even distance from the car ahead of me and pull over to the shoulder if it gets too bad. After that comes the point where I start to think, \"Oh my god, this is it, all the other times have been panic attacks but this time is different, i'm actually going to die this time,\" and I'm completely consumed. Throughout all of this, my heart is pounding in my chest so hard that you can actually see it in my stomach. I've never fainted, but there have been times when it would have been a mercy, nights when sleeplessness turned into six or seven hours of helpless fear. I've driven myself to the ER more than once, with nothing to show except a bill I can't afford and a tiny bottle of benzodiazepines that I ration like it was the last canteen of potable water on earth. Here's something that has helped me. When it first started, I would look my symptoms up on the internet, which led to scary results like \"congenital heart failure\", \"emphysema\", \"stroke\", or \"brain tumour\". Now I append the word \"anxiety\" to whatever I'm experiencing. So, for example, I'll search \"shortness of breath anxiety,\" \"limb pain anxiety,\" or even something as weird as \"feel like i have to burp all the time anxiety.\" Without fail this has brought up a dozen other people who have dealt with the same symptoms and received the same diagnosis. A panic attack makes you feel like you're going to die; knowing that other people have gone through the same thing and survived is very, very helpful. \u2013Brian Sullivan", "url": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/robynwilder/panic-attack-experience", "summary": "I had several \"episodes\" after that, but because they were so physiological I didn't realised they were panic attacks until my doctor diagnosed me with panic disorder.\nI now travel freely and haven't experienced an acute panic attack for years, although I do suffer with depression and generalised anxiety.\n\u2013@montagmildredThe first time I had a panic attack I immediately thought I was having a heart attack.\nEven once I'd realised panic attacks probably wouldn't kill me, being sick in public was definitely a fear.\nWhile reading the questions, I briefly contemplated the possibility of failing the paper, and that's when the panic attack hit.", "timescraped": 1513838657.720521, "category": {"words": 3742, "personal": 239, "thirdperson": 19, "condition": 12, "recovery": 0}}, "001e6c05aa46a03f5aa2e5874a919429": {"title": "Here's Why People With Anxiety Can Struggle With Public Transport", "image": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-02/25/8/campaign_images/webdr01/mental-health-transport-2-5489-1456407119-1_dblbig.jpg", "text": "Transport bosses held their first ever UK summit on how best to help travellers with mental health issues.\n\nTransport bosses in Britain held their first ever summit on how best to help people with mental health conditions cope with the struggle of using buses, trains, and aeroplanes. At the conference in London on Thursday, they heard from mental health experts how public transport can send people with anxiety, depression, and dementia into a spiral of despair. Some train operators already provide specialist training to staff to help passengers with dementia, and some airports now recognise that children with autism need a different security search procedure. But government ministers believe there is still a long way to go before people with mental health conditions get the same level of assistance on transport as those with physical disabilities. Around 1 in 4 people will experience a mental health issue at some point in their lives and 1 in 10 live with a long-term condition, according to the Mental Health Action Group.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlastair Campbell, a former political aide who now speaks for the mental health anti-stigma campaign Time to Change, said public transport was a nightmare for people suffering from anxiety. He told the summit: \"It resonates for me because I had a breakdown in the '80s, there were points at which I was having conversations with buses. Now I know that sounds completely crazy, and it is because I was, but I was in the midst of a psychotic meltdown. \"But imagine if you get on the tube, you get on a train, you get on the bus, and you\u2019re in a state of real anxiety. When you are, you feel pressures that nobody else can see and feel. You feel threatened by the movement, you feel threatened that all these other people seem to have real purpose in their lives because they\u2019re rushing to the next thing. \"Any tube station you go to, thousands of people going through there now. Imagine how many people are feeling on edge, it\u2019s a hell of a lot. And from that feeling of 'on edge', the spiralling into something far more serious \u2013 it can happen very, very quickly.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCampbell said his 21-year-old daughter went to university in Paris and suffered panic attacks on the Metro underground system. \"They were really bad to the point where she couldn\u2019t go on the Metro and she eventually packed it in,\" he said. \"That is so common, when people go to a new environment and there\u2019s all this movement and chaos and people looking like they\u2019re happy and they\u2019ve got purpose \u2013 and suddenly in that maelstrom, people find themselves thinking I just can\u2019t hack this. That\u2019s happening on planes, buses, trains right now. Thousands and thousands of people are feeling like that.\" Campbell said there wasn't much that could be done about overcrowding and not everyone would get a seat. But he urged all travellers to be aware of those around them. \"I think all of us should be on the lookout for people who are on edge,\" he said. \"Honestly nine times out of 10, if you were to say to somebody 'Are you OK?', you\u2019ll find out very quickly if they are or they aren\u2019t. But we\u2019re scared of having that conversation.\"\n\n\n\nTransport minister Andrew Jones called on the transport industry to come up with concrete ideas on how to help those with mental health conditions. They will be fed into the government's \"accessibility action plan\", to be published later this year. Jones said that while 90% of buses are equipped to serve people with physically disabilities \u2013 with wheelchair space, priority seats, and handrails \u2013 there had been \"nothing like that kind of progress\" on mental health. He said: \"Even someone with the best mental health will sometimes find public transport stressful and bewildering. No wonder someone who experiences anxiety, panic attacks, memory loss, or a host of other possible conditions can feel unable to use public transport. \"Those with mental health conditions have as much right to travel as anyone else. And making the improvements these passengers want needn\u2019t be expensive. It\u2019s often just a question of listening, being flexible, and giving staff the right kind of training.\"\n\nFirst Bus is among the companies already offering solutions. They have introduced a \"Better Journeys\" card that people can use to alert the bus driver to any special help they might need. Virgin Trains has been working with the Alzheimer\u2019s Society to deliver specialist training to station staff.

The struggle to get out of bed is even harder for those who are suffering from anxiety, knowing that they do not know what will be in store for that day. They may look at themselves in the mirror while getting ready and wonder if today will be another day where everything goes from great to suddenly unbearable. Many people who have anxiety or depression wake up in the morning feeling great, but that can change suddenly and often without much warning anytime during the day.\n\nWaking up with anxiety means that you have to prepare for the unknown, not knowing when or what will change your mood and cause it to have a panic attack. The not knowing can be the hardest part of struggling with anxiety. This with the today's stigma that any mental issue should be hidden or ignored can make the days seem long and unbearable. That is why it is important to understand that one: people with anxiety or depression have nothing to hide or ignore. Having anxiety does not mean you are less of a person or damage, you are not alone there are people just like you, many probably around you.\n\nI have suffered from anxiety for a long time but like many people have ignored it for most my life. The fear of admitting I had a problem and the fear that people will think less of me for it has prevented me from seeking help for a long time. Year after year I would tell myself I would start going to someone and talk through my feelings and year after year I would chicken out and say nothing. The more I ignored it, the more it would poke its scary head in my life. At the end of sophomore year of college, it became clear to me that I had to find a solution. This and the push from some of my closest friends made me decide to finally ask for help and start talking to a therapist.\n\nThis is a great first step for those who are struggling like I have been, but it is not always the fix that you hope it will be. While talking definitely helped me better understand what I am feeling, it was not enough and I had to keep looking for a better solution. Medication is something that should never be taken lightly but should not be crossed out because you are afraid to be labeled as someone who needs to take medication for mental illness. That is why after a discussion with my friends, family and therapist I decided to look at meds as an option.\n\nThis option is not a quick fix either, it takes time and controlled experimentation to find the right option for you. I started taking Zoloft, hoping it would be the blessing I was looking for. It was not!!! Instead of making me feel less anxious, it made me feel super sick for weeks. These were some of the hardest weeks of my life, where I was not only trying to control my emotions but also felt like I was gonna throw up every day for over two weeks.\n\nI could have given up and said this is my life now and I will just have to deal with it but that is no way to live. So, I talk to my doctor and am trying a new medication now. While it has yet to take effect in my mental state, it has stopped making me feel sick. So what am I trying to say here is that while it may seem like there is not a solution to what you are going through, DO NOT GIVE UP. You are not alone and things will get better, maybe not today or tomorrow but they will.\n\nThe struggle of anxiety is not just something that affects those who have it but also the friends of those who have it. The friend may not know how to deal with seeing their friend struggle and may not know how to handle it when they see their friend struggling. These are some suggestions for the friend of someone with anxiety (from my personal experience):\n\n1. Take care of yourself, do not let their anxiety become your anxiety\n\n2. Be honest with your friend, if you can be there for them great if you can not tell\n\nthem this!!\n\n3. Do not leave them alone when they are panicking. No matter what they\n\nsay, they do not want to be alone and being alone will only make it worse.\n\n4. Listen and be understanding. Many times people just want to know people\n\ncare and will listen.\n\n5. Tell them how much they mean to you, sometimes something small like that\n\ncan make a major difference to someone in need.\n\n6. Be yourself. Do not act differently around them.\n\nAnxieties effects can reach past those who have it and affect those around that person so be aware of that but do not let stop looking for help. My friends and family are the reason that has been able to take these steps to work on my anxiety. I would not be where I am now without their constant support, especially my amazing best friends who have been there for every freakout, phone call and crying sessions.\n\nAnd no matter what remember, YES you have anxiety but NO you are NOT \u201ccrazy\u201d!!!", "url": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/jbrosty/yes-i-have-anxiety-no-i-am-not-crazy-32ym1", "summary": "That is why it is important to understand that one: people with anxiety or depression have nothing to hide or ignore.\nI have suffered from anxiety for a long time but like many people have ignored it for most my life.\nThe friend may not know how to deal with seeing their friend struggle and may not know how to handle it when they see their friend struggling.\nMy friends and family are the reason that has been able to take these steps to work on my anxiety.\nAnd no matter what remember, YES you have anxiety but NO you are NOT \u201ccrazy\u201d!!", "timescraped": 1513838665.215484, "category": {"words": 913, "personal": 27, "thirdperson": 14, "condition": 14, "recovery": 0}}, "b4a2f10753d73807899c2e9df6c1ce67": {"title": "24 Beautiful Tattoos Inspired By Mental Illness", "image": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2015-08/11/15/campaign_images/webdr14/24-beautiful-tattoos-inspired-by-mental-illness-2-1210-1439319661-7_dblbig.jpg", "text": "\"I\u2019ve struggled with OCD and panic disorder for most of my life.

It's the early 1960s, in \"the last days of a fair prince's reign\" (as a voiceover fancifully describes the JFK presidency), and it's also early in what would become more than a half-century of white flight, deindustrialization, and crime eroding the city's population. This being a Guillermo del Toro movie, the hints of the eventual hollowing out of neighborhoods are depicted with the same sense of grandeur as the unlikely love story that follows, done up in deep, rich colors and moody lighting. Main character Elisa (Sally Hawkins), for instance, inhabits an enchantingly ragtag apartment perched above a fading movie palace, with bits of dialogue drifting through the floorboards from the mostly empty theater below. Elisa, like most of The Shape of Water's characters, lives in the city. But the film's villain, a malevolent government suit named Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon), does not. When he heads home, he swings his chrome-detailed car away from downtown and toward a breezy street lined with trees and mid-century houses that feels like it might as well be another universe, one in which the sun somehow shines brighter and milkmen scurry by in crisp white shirts. In a way, it is another universe \u2014 the America that Strickland, a monster born of his era's darkest paranoid patriotism, is striving for. He works for a God he imagines looks a lot like him, and for a country of Cadillacs and jetpacks and chipper nuclear families and racial uniformity. \"The future is bright. You gotta trust in that. This is America,\" he tells his son, the affirmation of a new manifest destiny in which those vintage, sitcom-worthy 'burbs would stretch from coast to coast. He makes that optimism sound like a threat \u2014 and it is, to anyone who\u2019s not included in its vision of progress. The myth of the suburbs as a wholesome, throwback refuge has taken a pummeling at the movies this year, from the sinister opening scene of Get Out to three fall prestige releases \u2014 The Shape of Water, Suburbicon, and Downsizing \u2014 that all take their own stylized runs at a similar idea. That sense of suburban sprawl as a repository for an outdated American dream haunts del Toro\u2019s winsome creature feature very effectively; it also compelled and confounded directors George Clooney and Alexander Payne, both of whom made suburb-centric, award-season hopefuls starring Matt Damon. Whether it\u2019s of the past or future, these movies all conjure an idealized suburban vision that lingers like a mirage in some part of our national consciousness. But they also demonstrate that it's not easy to go to battle with a concept. Clooney's Suburbicon fizzled out soon after it hit theaters. Payne\u2019s Downsizing seems poised to do the same when it opens this Friday. These are, not coincidentally, films that lob awkward critiques from inside the fantasy they're trying to dispel \u2014 from the point of view of characters who still enjoy a place in the planned community, even if their lives are not what they'd expected. The Shape of Water, on the other hand, is slipping toward the Oscars, maybe because it cleverly takes the tone of a myth itself, and maybe because it approaches the fantasia of the spacious house, the picket fence, the good schools, the good living \u2014 and everything else left unsaid \u2014 from the perspective of those who aren't included in it.\n\nIn March of this year, Business Insider ran a series on the death of the suburb, laying out an argument for how the demise of malls and McMansions, and the slump of casual dining restaurants and big-box stores, were indicators of a larger lifestyle shift. It wasn't that the suburbs were going away, the articles suggested (though the young and affluent keep clustering in cities where there are more jobs), it was that suburbs themselves were also shifting \u2014 toward walkability and denser, multifamily housing near public transit \u2014 becoming more citylike. The promise of the traditional suburbs that Strickland heads home to in The Shape of Water, that Gardner Lodge (Damon) dreams of escaping from in Suburbicon, and which Paul Safranek (also Damon) goes to incredible lengths to afford in Downsizing, isn't a very 2017 sort of promise \u2014 even if Downsizing is set somewhere near the present day. What's driving this trend isn't an IRL push toward these communities, but a figurative one. The suburbs, especially the idealized, impossible communities of the late '50s in Suburbicon and early '60s in The Shape of Water, are what's meant to come to mind when someone talks about wanting to Make America Great Again. Or, as the sign Tennessee congressional candidate Rick Tyler posted last year more starkly put it, \"Make America White Again.\" Tyler defended himself by saying he wanted to return the country to the \"1960s, Ozzie and Harriet, Leave It to Beaver time when there were no break-ins; no violent crime; no mass immigration.\" It's a fantasy of an era that people have sought everywhere, from the \"whiteopia\" of North Idaho (\"it just felt like America in the 1950s\") to the promises of Donald Trump, who pointed to \"the late '40s and '50s\" as the time when \"we were pretty much doing what we had to do\" as a country. Clearly, Tyler missed some lessons in the subtle art of dog-whistle politics, or felt that the need to disguise bigotry had passed, but either way, the direct connection he made between this particular breed of nostalgia and whiteness was almost a relief to finally hear spoken out loud. What was always there was finally brought to the surface.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, the idea of something warped lurking beneath the surface-perfect sheen of retro Americana is a juxtaposition that's now practically retro itself. That might be why Suburbicon, which attempts to illuminate the connection between \u201cgreat\u201d and white as if this reveal were a surprise, comes across as so toothless. The movie weds an old Coen brothers script about the dark side of an allegedly idyllic bedroom community (in which a boy, Nicky [Noah Jupe], slowly realizes there's nothing Father Knows Best about his seemingly upright dad) with a far more grounded story about a black family getting harassed after moving into the all-white neighborhood \u2014 and ends up doing justice to neither. Even though, according to Clooney, Suburbicon began as a film about housing discrimination, and the Coen elements were added to provide \"some form of entertainment,\" the end result is a movie in which the storyline about race feels like an afterthought. The black family that causes such an uproar in the neighborhood barely gets to speak; the escalating violence and hostility they face is a horrifying, but largely symbolic, development that\u2019s eclipsed by the more madcap (and movie star\u2013heavy) murder plot unfolding in parallel. Clooney may have set out to criticize sentimentality toward the film's era and setting, but he turns out to be as susceptible to the aesthetic allure of the suburbs as anyone else. We can see that in the choice to have Julianne Moore reprise her brittle '50s housewife routine, to put Damon back in shirtsleeves and browline glasses, and to open the film with a chirpy slideshow advertising the amusingly narrow charms of the community for which it's named. Suburbicon is akin to watching someone do a standup set in front of a building that's on fire, trying to keep the viewer's attention with easy punchlines while a genuine menace blurs into the background.\n\nDamon\u2019s suburban dreams in Downsizing are more contemporary; it's upward mobility, or a lack thereof, that's on his mind. His character, Paul, is a kind and incurious occupational therapist who lives with his wife Audrey (Kristen Wiig) in his Omaha, Nebraska, childhood home. She has her heart set on a newer, bigger place in a nicer area they can't afford, and he struggles to make the finances work. While not unhappy himself, he's plagued by a nagging sense that he should be doing better than he is \u2014 keeping up with successful high school classmates, climbing the ladder. In other words, his economic anxiety is getting him down. So, instead of scaling back their dreams, the couple decides to scale down their bodies with a new, irreversible scientific process in which people are shrunk to a few inches tall. This allows them to consume fewer environmental resources and, more importantly, live luxe miniature lifestyles on their regular-size bank accounts. It's a sci-fi variation on Americans going abroad to stretch their US dollars in developing economies, only instead of heading abroad, it involves heading to a Lilliputian-planned community in New Mexico called Leisureland. In Leisureland, everyone can afford a pool and jewelry and to while away their days like rich retirees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's a different kind of suburban fantasy, but once you get past the droll, Charlie Kaufman-esque imagined technology, it's not too far removed from those gleaming visions from the '50s and '60s. Leisureland offers those same, outdated expectations of effortless prosperity and an unquestioned white majority, preserved the only way they can be \u2014 by way of extreme contortions and self-rationalizations. The characters in Downsizing risk a possibly lethal procedure in order to to afford a five-bedroom house and then pat themselves on the back and say they did it to save the planet from overpopulation. It's a visually delightful metaphor, but it gets messier and less meaningful as soon as Paul makes his way to Leisureland's far reaches. There, downsized immigrants live in a miniscule tenement without the benefits and protections enjoyed by the main community, commuting in to clean and build and do all the other labor that people like Paul are trying to opt out of. As Downsizing sets out to teach the well-meaning, oblivious Paul some tough lessons about the world and his place in it (with assists from Christoph Waltz as an amoral, hard-partying European exporter and Hong Chau as a selfless Vietnamese refugee and all-around magical Asian), it begins to demonstrate the same myopic limitations of Suburbicon.\n\nBoth films center on figures whose assumptions about family and the future fall apart (Nicky in Suburbicon, Paul in Downsizing), and whose personal misfortunes are set up as small-scale equivalents of the systemic tragedies that afflict characters on the movies' outskirts. Nicky ends up genuinely, rather than begrudgingly, befriending Andy (Tony Espinosa), the black kid next door, after his home life implodes so spectacularly. Paul discovers economic and global realities he never gave much thought to \u2014 but only after the perfect, pocket-sized lifestyle he'd come to Leisureland for got derailed. These choices feel like mediation, as if the experience of being marginalized \u2014 whether you\u2019re targeted by hostile neighbors or used as dehumanized labor for a community you're not allowed to be a part of \u2014 needs to be filtered through Nicky and Paul in order to be relatable or accessible. Suburbicon and Downsizing are both driven by the desire to create some common ground with the audience through these characters who haven't been seeing the whole picture \u2014 to find a way into broader cultural questions of exclusion by way of these white protagonists and their more intimate dramas. They end up being dutiful meditations on guilt rather than stories about the people whose mistreatment and oppression they purport to be so interested in. The increasingly disastrous press tour their shared star Damon is currently in the midst of for Downsizing turns out to be, ironically, appropriate. Like these movies, Damon has been unable to stop himself from turning a conversation about something systemic into one about himself. The Shape of Water, in contrast, roots itself from the start in the perspectives of characters whose identities render them invisible, interchangeable, or vulnerable to those in power. Its heroine, Elisa, who is disabled, and the allies she acquires (a gay man, a black woman, a foreigner) are people who already know very well, or are forced to accept, that they're on the wrong side of the picket fence. If it sounds schematic on the page, like a supergroup of the disenfranchised, it plays sweetly and straightforwardly onscreen. Just as the city they share isn't idealized \u2014 it's just where they live \u2014 the way these characters are drawn together isn't idealized, either. It's not the commonalities in how they've been demeaned or dismissed that ultimately unify them. It's that they are, both literally and figuratively, in a place to see each other more clearly than people like Strickland, with his gaze fixed on his imagined future and his home life cozily secured, miles away.\n\nAnd they're not all immune to the warm lure of Americana either, as evidenced by Giles' (Richard Jenkins) doomed crush on the counterboy at a chain restaurant. He\u2019s a strapping, dimpled young man who speaks with a twang and offers up easy chatter \u2014 a performance of down-home charm that's entirely synthetic, an act put on to sell pie that Giles can barely choke down. The arc of their two-scene relationship neatly encapsulates the ideas The Shape of Water expands on over the rest of its runtime (with much more resonance than Suburbicon or Downsizing): Everyone's free to fall in love with the idea of the idyllic American suburb \u2014 but it's not going to love everyone back the same way. And maybe that idea won't appeal to everyone in the first place. The alienation The Shape of Water so efficiently lays out in two scenes, Get Out sums up in just one \u2014 its opening sequence: Andre (Lakeith Stanfield) strolls along a leafy suburban street with obvious and, it turns out, extremely warranted unease as a lone black man walking through a white neighborhood. It's a setting out of a Halloween movie, except instead of a masked slasher, Andre\u2019s afraid of getting shot by the cops because a panicked local assumed he was a threat. When he\u2019s snatched off the sidewalk, it's a double reversal \u2014 something scary was lurking out there in the dark \u2014 but it's also a reminder that for some, the idea of the suburbs has never been a sanctuary at all. \u25cf\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlison Willmore is a film critic for BuzzFeed News and is based in New York.

In the past 15 years, there have been four major studies to look at this link. Here's a little bit more on those:\n\nTwo of the studies were inconclusive and didn't find any significant positive or negative mood effects from birth control. The first was a 2003 study that looked at 658 women taking birth control pills. They found that some women felt their premenstrual mood was worse on the pill while others thought it was better, and the only predictor of a worse mood was a history of depression. The next was a 2007 population-based study in Australia that looked at over 9,000 young women. They found that women taking birth control pills were no more likely to experience depressive symptoms than women not taking the pill, after adjusting for other factors. They also found that the likelihood of experiencing depressive symptoms while on the pill decreased as time went on.\n\nThe other two studies actually found positive mood effects associated with hormonal birth control.

I crave the next object of my attention.\" \"I have had ADD all my life and it has caused me to constantly crave new sources of entertainment...or, later in life, academic material. The learning part was a big revelation for me at Berkeley. I don't need to be watching TV or talking to friends all the time. But my brain needs to be stimulated most of the time, even if I want to relax. I found that one of the most calming things I can do is actually to listen to academic podcasts in my downtime from studying. Not only do I find them interesting, but listening actually relaxes me, whereas, if I did nothing for 15 minutes after studying for 45 minutes I would actually be less rested to begin my next study sprint. Sitting around with nothing to do with my mind actually causes me to get anxious. I crave the next object of my attention. I still think that my ADD has limited my productivity, however, I did manage to get pretty good grades at one of the most competitive undergraduate programs in the country. I have learned that by creating a study plan and switching up subjects as well as the objects of my attention I can actually sometimes use my ADD productively. On the other hand I can barely get through an episode of TV on Netflix before wanting to start a new show.

I can get completely lost in a project for days on end to the exclusion of eating and caring for myself \u2014 a lot of people don't realize that intense super focus is a side effect of attentional disorders. I'm also constantly late and panicking about it \u2014 either because I've completely lost track of time because I'm so immersed in what I'm doing, or because I've just plain underestimated how long it will take me to get somewhere, no matter how many times I've been through it before. I use about 27 different reminders and alarm systems to keep me functioning at a level that won't ruin my life.

School and projects were always hard because I always want to do a million things at once and then it's overwhelming when I have a bunch of half-done things. Once I started understanding it as an 'over-awareness' of my surroundings, I started to just convince myself I only had this one thing to do (whatever it may be), I have an easier time finishing it. Basically, understanding it this way makes me less harsh with myself about it and know exactly what strengths and weaknesses come from it. Overall, I still have trouble in conversations going from A to E with people and having to backtrack and say what my thought process was. A lot of the time, when someone is getting to know me, they assume I'm changing the subject when there is actually a linear progression in my mind so it IS related even if it's not apparent. I think it's the most difficult with people who think very linearly (like my current BF), but I find if I take the time to explain what's going on in my head, people are more onboard. Overall, I try to embrace it as an asset because it allows me to think differently than other people which is ideal for someone in a creative field.\" \u2014Anonymous Share On email Share On email\n\nShare On link Share On link Share This Link\n\nShare On facebook Share On facebook Share\n\n4. \"Things are better now; I found that controlling my anxiety is the key to controlling my attention deficit problems.\" \"I was diagnosed with both generalized anxiety disorder and ADHD (inattentive, not hyperactive) when I was in my mid-twenties. I felt very relieved to know that there was a reason that focusing on things was hard for me, that I wasn't just avoiding doing certain things because I was lazy or didn't want to do them (I avoided them because of the stress and anxiety that I knew struggling to focus would cause me). I also felt kind of amazing because the woman who diagnosed me noted that I was 'highly intelligent,' which was why I had managed to get good grades and still manage to be somewhat productive in school \u2014 when you live with ADHD without knowing it, you find ways to cope and push your way through difficult situations. But work was a different issue. Job performance was always hard for me, especially if I wasn't really interested in the job (and I never was). I'd forget to do big things, and little things would take me forever to finish. When I could finish something, there were usually tons of mistakes because I'd put so much pressure on myself to be perfect that I'd freak out so much it became even harder to focus. When I finally found the guts to tell one boss what was going on with me, he promptly forgot and tried to make a spectacle of me in front of some of my co-workers. Things are better now; I found that controlling my anxiety is the key to controlling my attention deficit problems. I still struggle with it, but it feels good to know that I've been able to accomplish so much in spite of it.\" \u2014Tracy Clayton Share On email Share On email\n\nShare On link Share On link Share This Link\n\nShare On facebook Share On facebook Share\n\n5. \"Sometimes I think of ADD as a weird blessing creatively because I'm always working on something \u2014 I'm never just stuck on one project and I end up accomplishing more that way.\" \"As a kid, I always struggled with paying attention in class or even keeping my desk in order. Teachers were always calling my parents into conferences about my 'behavior' and would try to move me to lower-level classes because they thought I was slow or lazy or both. Once I got to high school, I realized that my zoning out and way of talking (jumping from one seemingly related story to another at the speed of light) made it harder to make friends or connect with people, so I would stress out about focusing all the time. Reading was the hardest of all, because I would read a sentence and then drift off and then realize I read 20 pages without actually processing anything because I was in my own thoughts. I was never formally diagnosed, but my mom read my exact symptoms in a book and it made me feel better about my brain and helped me learn that I wasn't some loser who didn't want to focus or work hard. It was just more difficult for me. With age, it's gotten so much easier, and sometimes I think of ADD as a weird blessing creatively because I'm always working on something \u2014 I'm never just stuck on one project and I end up accomplishing more that way. So many artistic people have ADD and have simply learned to channel it into something very positive.\" \u2014Julia Pugachevsky Share On email Share On email\n\nShare On link Share On link Share This Link\n\nShare On facebook Share On facebook Share\n\n6. \"For the most part, I see it as just a part of who I am \u2014 my wandering mind and fascination with the world's random details have made me into the writer and thinker that I am.\" \"For pretty much my whole life, people have \u2014 without my asking \u2014 self-diagnosed me with ADD. I go off on tangents when telling stories, and tasks like packing or folding laundry that require a kind of singular focus can be unusually challenging and draining. I've been distracted at least five times since starting to write this paragraph. For the most part, I see it as just a part of who I am \u2014 my wandering mind and fascination with the world's random details have made me into the writer and thinker that I am. But when people say, 'Get to the point! You're so ADD,' or 'Can you hurry up? You're so unfocused,' it can be stressful and even a little hurtful. I eventually saw a doctor to work on some solutions, and have been prescribed medications a few times. I've found they really do help with things like studying and staying organized, but the crash at the end of the day can be rough. If the comedown from the meds happens to coincide with a low point in the day where I'm doubting myself, my emotions can spiral out of control. I'm still trying to find the right balance.\" \u2014Anonymous Share On email Share On email\n\nShare On link Share On link Share This Link\n\nShare On facebook Share On facebook Share", "url": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/juliapugachevsky/stories-on-living-with-add-and-adhd", "summary": "\u2014Alec Strachan Share On email Share On emailShare On link Share On link Share This LinkShare On facebook Share On facebook ShareAdvertisement2.\n\u2014Anonymous Share On email Share On emailShare On link Share On link Share This LinkShare On facebook Share On facebook Share3.\n\u2014Anonymous Share On email Share On emailShare On link Share On link Share This LinkShare On facebook Share On facebook Share4.\n\u2014Tracy Clayton Share On email Share On emailShare On link Share On link Share This LinkShare On facebook Share On facebook Share5.\n\u2014Anonymous Share On email Share On emailShare On link Share On link Share This LinkShare On facebook Share On facebook Share", "timescraped": 1513838643.292479, "category": {"words": 1693, "personal": 108, "thirdperson": 7, "condition": 4, "recovery": 2}}, "d273bae02bf35b625ca330792f53eb22": {"title": "Using the Magic 8-Ball to Answer Emails", "image": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/campaign_images/terminal01/2009/2/14/12/using-the-magic-8-ball-to-answer-emails-16263-1234632273-0.jpg", "text": "Using the Magic 8-Ball to Answer Emails\n\nAn example of how to use the magic 8-ball in email exchanges.", "url": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/peggy/using-the-magic-8-ball-to-answer-emails", "summary": "Using the Magic 8-Ball to Answer EmailsAn example of how to use the magic 8-ball in email exchanges.", "timescraped": 1513838644.779111, "category": {"words": 18, "personal": 0, "thirdperson": 0, "condition": 0, "recovery": 0}}, "768d862516c479c11464e6e6d9f703df": {"title": "25 Anxiety Inducing GIFs That Have A Happy Ending, I Promise", "image": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2017-12/13/20/enhanced/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-01/original-13660-1513216464-5.png?crop=1198:627;0,0", "text": "Every.

In high school I fought my parents to let me see a therapist, and when I finally saw one before my senior year of high school, I was diagnosed with major depression, OCD, and social anxiety disorder. Senior year was tough \u2014 I made excuses to friends as to why I was busy every Tuesday afternoon because I was embarrassed to say I was in therapy. I confided in a few close friends who were supportive, but frankly I was relieved to leave my hometown for a college in a different part of the country. I thought things would change, and that my depression would disappear because I was finally away from my hometown baggage. I was wrong. I saw a school counselor my freshman year at college, but I was too distracted by the newness of it all to really focus on my mental health. The summer after freshman year, my depression returned in full force. Upon returning to school for the first semester of my sophomore year, I was unable to recognize that my depression had completely incapacitated me. I attempted suicide soon after the semester began \u2014 the only reason I survived is because my friends realized there was something wrong with me that night. Afterwards, I dropped out of school and returned home to get the help I so desperately needed. I went through four different therapists and five different medications before I found the combination that worked for me, and when that happened it was not like magic, it wasn't like a beam of sunlight breaking through the clouds. It was like trudging up a mountain pass, swamped in mud and ice with an 80-pound weight around my neck. But finally I reached the peak, and started down an easier path. There are still many days that I force myself uphill again, but now my pack is a little lighter, I have the tools to make the going a little easier, and I know that I have loved ones who have and will continue to carry me on days when I just can't walk anymore. I always start hiking again the next morning. And I'm proud of myself. \u2014Cates Holderness\n\nA month before I was born, my grandfather died. My grandmother was suicidal. She moved in with my parents and they all waited for me. When I was born, my grandmother said, \"You saved my life.\" It's one of the first things I remember her telling me. So there's that. Some say it's not right to tell people that it is selfish to kill themselves, but honestly, that was the only thing that kept me from trying a few times. I'm sorry. I couldn't do that to my boyfriend, my friends, or my siblings, or even to my parents \u2014 who back then I mostly blamed for the crazy in my brain. Whatever kooky body chemistry we all have brought me \u2014 brought us all \u2014 to the brink. I wanted to figure out a fix for us. But I was so tired. One day, I saw a random ad for a depression study at a hospital, and despite my inability to follow through on anything at the time, I went. I went back. It saved me. \u2014Anonymous\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor a few years in my early twenties it was my job to drink. Every day, every night, as much as possible. I had other jobs, ones that paid, but those came and went and were just ways of making money, money that I would spend on a sea of bottles. I was alone and confused, carrying barbed memories from my childhood that squirmed in a thorny tangle inside my chest, but would stretch out through my mouth or up into my mind if I didn't battle them back down with alcohol. I didn't have any ambition, or any interest in finding my way. Being drunk and sad and alone was my job \u2014 and you know what? I didn't hate it. Being lost at sea was a comfort. Luckily for me, even though I felt alone, I wasn't. Slowly strangers became acquaintances, and acquaintances became friends. Some were a lot like me, and others weren't. But all of them became shipmates, I a part of their crew and they a part of mine. Even just talking to them loosened the tangled monster that gripped me, enough for me to find another star \u2014 that of forgiveness \u2014 to light my way. I forgave, not because the things that I remembered were resolved or any sort of justice was served, but because I was willing to let go. There is still a tangle inside of me, but I'm not as frightened of it. Once in a while, the memories do send their despairing tendrils up into my mind and flow out of my mouth as speech, but even when things seem darkest, I have the first two stars that helped me navigate into safer waters: friendship and forgiveness. \u2014Isaac Fitzgerald\n\nWhen I was studying abroad, I heard that a few of my close family friends had passed away. As I kept getting the news, I found myself starting to feel really empty and genuinely numb to the outside world. I was crying nearly every day and just felt a hopelessness that wouldn't go away. It was a strange feeling that I had never experienced before. During class, the only thing I could think about was getting back in my bed. About a month after dealing with this, I was diagnosed with \"seasonal depression,\" and it was really hard because all my friends wanted to go out and would practically make fun of me when I didn't want to. I felt embarrassed to tell them I was going through it, and, even worse, having to take medication for it. I would get stuck in conversations where people said that depression was just an excuse people make and wasn't even a real thing. It's funny, because I always questioned people suffering from the same thing. It was really hard, and makes you feel even more isolated. It's strange because you begin to distance yourself from everyone and relationships get really difficult and unbalanced. Luckily, I wanted to force myself off the medicine and try more of a homeopathic routine, and it worked. I sometimes have off days, but it was the true friendships and family support that helped me overcome it. After going through it myself, it made me look at mental illness in a whole new way that really needs to be addressed. \u2014Anonymous\n\nWhen I was 9, I was the victim of a vicious sexual assault by a friend's older brother. For years after that I was depressed. I kept it a secret, and was afraid to tell anyone for fear of being ostracized and treated differently. I felt alone, and since I had no one to talk to about it, I suffered in silence. When I was 15, I made a conscious decision to take my own life. I knew that my dad kept a revolver in his nightstand. It was a Saturday in the spring, and my parents went to the local fair for the afternoon. I took my dad's revolver to our back patio and readied myself. As I was taking the gun out of its sheath, I heard a car pull into my parents' driveway. This spooked me, so I hid the gun, and found out it was my aunt coming to drop something off. After she left I put the gun back, went into the house, and cried. I saw it as a sign from God that I was not meant to die that day. I was still extremely bothered by what had happened to me as a child. A few years later, with the help of a friend, I was able to tell my parents about the assault. What helped me the most through my feelings and stages of utter despair was talking to other survivors who had been the victims of similar attacks. There are many people who have been assaulted as children, I came to find out. I initially talked to a friend's sister who had been sexually abused as a child, as well. Over the years I have talked to many other people, and it was so uplifting to know that I was not alone. For me, the cure was talking to others. No matter how bad it may seem, or how alone you may feel, others are there to help. By the grace of God and good people, I was able to get through that trying time in my life. \u2014Anonymous\n\nOne of the saddest things in the world is to feel broken, and although you've somehow been figuratively ripped apart, you feel like can never be put back together again. There are days when I ask myself, What are you staying here for? Most times I don't even have an answer. Sometimes I just don't want to be here anymore, and those are the toughest thoughts to deal with. But the days that I truly cherish are the ones where I'm so overwhelmed with happiness that it feels like I can beat this depression. That happiness comes from friends and the jokes we share with one another, it comes from family members and their unconditional love for me. I love when friends and family are able to penetrate the barrier of lies and insecurities that depression creates, allowing me to feel love. Those are the days that make life worth living, and those are the days that keep me fighting. The extremes of depression are the worst. One minute you could be on cloud nine and in the next you can feel like you've hit rock bottom. I will be seeing a therapist soon. One day, however, I would like to get to a place where I can know for certain, without a doubt in my mind, that I belong here without the validation that comes from external forces. \u2014Michael Blackmon\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI've never been clinically diagnosed with depression, but depression is one of those things that you don't need someone to tell you you have it to feel its wrath. For me, it comes and goes in waves, depending on triggering moments. The toughest part about struggling with something so consuming and life-altering is knowing its effects firsthand, and in turn, knowing you're sometimes helpless and unable to make the pain other people feel any better. After Robin Williams passed away last night, I was on Twitter looking at photos of the Good Will Hunting bench that some fans of his had turned into a memorial. One picture showed the bench and a quote from the film someone had written in chalk, \"It's not your fault.\" So often, people who suffer from depression and other mental illnesses are under the impression that their sicknesses are their burdens to carry, that it's somehow their problem and their problem alone. Not to mention that the stigmas our society has around anything that deviates from our standard expectations of mental health make depression even harder to talk about and grapple with. But if you suffer from depression, it's not your fault. It is not your fault. Thankfully, the people of Boston reminded me last night that Robin Williams knew it's not my fault, either. \u2014Krystie Yandoli\n\n\"Get some exercise, get those endorphins pumping, that always helps.\" \"Join a club or something.\" \"Just get out and get a little part-time job, something to just get you out of the house.\" These are all great suggestions for someone who may be looking to make a change in their life. But to someone struggling with clinical depression, they sound only like taunts. It took me a long time to come to terms with my depression. I started struggling with it in college but chalked it up to college blues and stress and overcommitment to various activities. I briefly went on meds, only to forget to refill my prescription because I \"didn't have time,\" which only made it worse. But depression can hide for a while, and though the year after college was mostly fine, it came back later with a new vengeance. As I struggled to find a full-time job at a time when the industry and economy was crumbling and everyone was talking about the \"death of journalism,\" I slipped deeper and deeper into depression, though I didn't know that's what it was at the time. I thought I wasn't working hard enough, maybe I was too lazy \u2014 if only I had more willpower. I felt embarrassed and ashamed at my shortcomings, unable to understand why someone who was known for being an overachiever could all of a sudden feel so useless and unable to function. Therapy helped a bit. But it wasn't until I was able to understand that what I was struggling with was really dysthymia (chronic low-grade mild depression, which at times can dip into major depression) that I was really able to get help. While it was so easy for me to help others close to me who were struggling with depression get the help they needed, I was blind when it came to myself. In the fall of 2012 I spent more than three weeks unable to get out of my bed. Going out to get a coffee across the street felt like a triumph. And all the while I hid it from most everyone I knew. When I first started feeling the effects of medication after finally seeing a psychiatrist, I couldn't believe that I'd waited that long to get help. It wasn't a magic pill that made everything better, but I was able to get out of bed in the morning. And you start to realize that it really shouldn't have been that hard to do the simple things. I didn't realize life could be another way until then. Life is hard enough on its own; it shouldn't be a daily struggle to leave your house, to cook a meal, to take a shower. After seeing the effects, I realized how long I'd tortured and blamed myself, thinking my sadness and futility was my fault somehow. But depression manifests in so many ways and across such a wide scale, I realized that I could've gone my whole life without realizing that there was a better way to live. And I hope that others reading this might know that even if your depression doesn't look like someone else's \u2014 maybe you're not bedridden, maybe you don't have major swings \u2014 there's still help out there for you, and it's not your fault. I know I'm one of the lucky ones, who responds well to medication and therapy. For many, it takes years to find the right combination of help to manage their depression. For many more, they're not able to find affordable access to mental health care. It's a problem I wish our country and health care industry would make a real priority. \u2014Aylin Zafar\n\nKT, Grandpa Ed, Josh. The names scroll through my head. Every day I think their names. KT, Grandpa Ed, Josh. It's not a voluntary thing. They, and others, burned their names into my brain during the most traumatic year and a half of my life. Suicide is like that. It scars those it leaves behind. Open, festering wounds, yearning for some way to go back and undo the damage. But you can't. It's the most terrible kind of permanence that exists. For many of us, myself included, thoughts of suicide are simply a part of life. This horrible, gaping hole that seemingly has no way of being filled. Like some kind of singularity, it draws us in. Inescapable. And then one day, you feel true pain. The pain of your best friend choosing to leave you; of the punk-rock icon and father figure of a generation deciding to end it all; of the gentlest, most caring soul you've ever known succumbing to their own pain. KT, Grandpa Ed, Josh. That pain is truly unbearable, because you know, no matter what, you must endure the pain of having lost people. No matter how weary, no matter how fucking tired you are, you can't put that on yet another person. To do so would be to dismiss their pain. To diminish their pain. To reject the one thing that keeps those you have loved, and lost, alive: your memories. So you soldier on. Every day, silently, unwillingly saying their names. And your one, your only respite, are the friends who walk that path with you. KT, Grandpa Ed, Josh. Given the chance, each of them would undo their decision in a heartbeat. They would never leave us if they knew the price we pay. KT, Grandpa Ed, Josh. They didn't know. But now you do. Tell a friend. A family member. A complete stranger. Tell me if you want. Because it can never be worse than what you'll leave behind. I know, because of KT, Grandpa Ed, Josh, and all those who've gone home too soon of their own accord. \u2014John Stanton\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are times when my depression has made me feel like I'm not doing anything right in my life. That's a tough thought to fight against, because it feeds itself: Once you're convinced that you're worthless, you stop doing anything worthwhile. And suddenly you've become the person you already thought you were, someone who naps for hours just to make the days go by faster, and who looks for any excuse to avoid getting up or even turning on the light. But you're not worthless, even if your depression is keeping you from being an active member of society. When I got help and began to start feeling like a human again, I was able to reflect honestly on my achievements and the paths I have taken. And one of the things I'm proudest of, which is something I cling to when the depressive tendencies creep back, is that I've always been open about my struggles. I know how much it helps me to be reminded that I'm not alone. If I can do the same for others, I know I'm doing something right. \u2014Louis Peitzman\n\nI went through maybe two full decades of my life in total denial of my depression. I think some people who were close to me could see it clearly, but I refused to identify as a person who was prone to depression. I didn't see myself as having problems as severe as other people, and didn't want others to think less of me. I never got help, even at the times when I actually did want it, because I didn't have a lot of money or insurance for long stretches of time. But that all caught up with me, and led to a period of clinical depression that got so bad that the only feelings strong enough to be felt through overwhelming numbness and apathy were anger, fear, and self-loathing. This had major consequences in my work life and led to me completely alienate someone with whom I was once very close. I had to reach this low to get real help beyond talk therapy, and to be prescribed an anti-depressant. It made all the difference, and I truly feel more like myself now. I am grateful that this positive change happened, but I think a lot about what my life would be like today if I had done this 10 years ago, 15 years ago, or 20 years ago. I urge other people, especially young people, to overcome their pride and do what they can to stop or at least manage destructive mental illness. It's a very hard thing to admit to having problems, but it's the only way you can hope to solve them. \u2014Anonymous\n\nI never feel comfortable talking about depression because I've never been officially diagnosed, but I remember making threats to take my own life during my freshman year of high school. A few friends at the time confronted me about it, and for me, that was enough \u2014 to know someone cared. It'd be so easy to dismiss a 14-year-old's unfinished suicide plan as melodramatic, angsty, or \"emo,\" and yeah, I guess I was all those things back then, but then again, no truly happy person is those things. I've seen articles on the internet about \"real\" depression vs. \"fake\" depression and I can't fathom how anyone could be so shallow as to think that those two things don't exist on the same plane \u2014 that someone who \"fakes\" depression (presumably for attention) doesn't really have a hard time living. I don't have trouble getting out of bed, and I'm not outwardly moody (those are the stereotypes, right?). But happiness is a state of mind that requires great maintenance on my part \u2014 I actually don't know how to \"just be happy.\" For me, it involves being constantly busy (distracted, even), regular exercise, a relatively healthy diet (I love cheese and ice cream too much), and a balance between bountiful social interaction and complete isolation. I'm not sure how many people feel like this. I have no idea. But happiness is work for many people. It's like skating on a flat surface \u2014 you make a few forceful pushes so you can glide, even if for a moment. \u2014Julia Pugachevsky\n\nRobin Williams' death, as with some others before him, has hit me particularly hard because of the closeness with which I view his struggles. As someone who has faced addiction and mental health issues, I can only say that talking about it and seeking help has been so important for me. Sharing and finding help doesn't fix it all \u2014 and it doesn't always work \u2014 but almost everyone I know would say that it lessens the burden at times. And, so often for me, the lessening of that burden is all that I needed to convince me that the next morning might be better. And, that's a start. \u2014Chris Geidner\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome days depression feels like an invisible hand holding my head down. I know the voice of despair lies to me, and I know my worries are unfounded, but some days the lies are very hard to resist, and I feel these brief, soul-crushing moments of despair. And then when I pull through these moments, I feel stronger, but I still fear the next barrage of despair. Once I started to wrestle with depression myself, my empathy increased dramatically. It is such a difficult thing to understand if you haven't experienced it. But I always encourage friends to seek therapy/counseling and most of all not to try to carry the burden by themselves. If you're struggling today, what you are going through is very real and if anyone gives you the impression you should simply \"snap out of it\" then you need to avoid that person's advice. It's not that simple. There is help and hope. \u2014Nathan Pyle\n\nI was diagnosed with depression and bipolar disorder when I was 17, and I've been on and off medications and in and out of therapy ever since. I consider myself an incredibly happy, stable person. One fact doesn't contradict the other. The surprising thing I've learned, as an adult with depression, is that there isn't really such a thing \u2014 for me, at least \u2014 as a big turning point or lifesaving moment, and that that's OK. I've learned about the cycle, that sometimes I will feel those recognizable symptoms: the sense that I've hollowed out, retreated a bit too deeply into my mind, forgetful of the happiness I've known and worrisome that I won't feel it again. But I've also learned to trust the other swing of the cycle, even when it seems furthest away: that I will come back out, that I'm never too far gone, that I'll resist the fall into emptiness, and I'll turn off the episode of whatever show I'm binge-watching, and get dressed, and rejoin the world. This isn't to say that I feel doomed to a life of depression; it's more a freedom to understand that if I do experience lows, it doesn't mean I (or my treatment) have somehow failed. I know that I'm susceptible to these lows but I also know, because I've been living it, that I can survive them. It's my trust in this fact that has been most important to me (along with, of course, the support of the people I love, therapy, and, when necessary, medication) because it reminds me of my will when it's at its weakest. It somehow makes those inevitable slumps less scary. \u2014Arianna Rebolini\n\nI've been fighting depression and anxiety for years. And it is a fight. Every day I battle my own brain. Some days I feel like I am winning, but many days it feels like a fight I will inevitably lose. Especially when I see others lose their own battles. When someone takes their life, it's tragic for their own sake and for the sake of their families, but on a personal level it is terrifying. Because if someone like that \u2014 someone talented, successful, beloved, seemingly with everything to live for, someone who has battled in the past and apparently won \u2014 if someone like that loses their fight, then what hope do I have? I try to remember that I do have hope. I hope that I can win this battle. I hope that I will have many more good days than bad days. I hope that everyone struggling knows they're not alone. I hope that in their darkest hours, people can fight their way through. I hope for understanding. I hope for compassion. I hope for happiness. I hope. \u2014Jenna Guillaume\n\nI was diagnosed with depression when I was 11 years old and started taking medication when I was 13. \"It's no different than taking medicine for your heart or for diabetes,\" my parents told me again and again, and I'm so grateful that they never made me feel ashamed of needing to take a pill to be my best self. It was the rest of the world that made me feel like I could never be open about my mental health issues. And, to some degree, my own pride. Growing up, a large part of my identity was in my good grades and my intelligence, and I was afraid I would lose that if I ever admitted to needing help of any kind, let alone with facing the demons inside my head. And so, when I began spiraling during my last semester of college, I didn't tell anyone. I locked myself in my dorm room, rarely leaving for class, my part-time job, or meals with friends. I had the perfect excuse: I was working on my honors thesis. Except that I wasn't. I was trying to. I was staring at my notes, staring at my flickering computer screen, and crying myself to sleep because I couldn't make myself write the words that were locked somewhere in my brain. The on-campus therapist and psychiatrist changed my medications but didn't seem to take it seriously when I described my inability to go to class or write. \"You're a smart girl. These will help and you'll be back on track soon,\" I remember the therapist telling me. But they didn't. And I wasn't. What's worse, I had to find out for myself about the school's program to help students experiencing mental health difficulties with their academics \u2014 and by the time I'd set up an appointment, it was too late to salvage my grades. My GPA dropped and graduating with honors was no longer in my future. I was able to graduate \u2014 barely \u2014 because (classic overachiever) I'd take extra classes every other semester. I never finished my thesis. It's been three years since graduation and I haven't gone back to my college campus. I'm not sure when I will. An amazing university and an overall amazing experience remains overshadowed by the hell I endured for the last five months of my senior year. I moved in with my parents and started seeing my old psychiatrist on a weekly basis until we figured out the right combination of medications to replace the ones that had stopped working after years of faithful service. In addition to my old friend depression, I was diagnosed with anxiety and given more meds. \"I can't believe they couldn't see this,\" my doctor said, angrily. \"You were clearly exhibiting all the signs. This new medication could have helped you so much.\" And, slowly, it did. I got an internship, and then the job that I had been aiming for since the summer after my sophomore year. I moved to Washington, D.C., and into a national newsroom. I landed my dream job at BuzzFeed and moved to New York City. I've never told this story before, let alone written it down and, scariest of all, attached my name to it. Not even when a younger friend made the brave decision to withdraw from the same college in order to seek mental health treatment. I'm still a little afraid about my parents seeing this. But when I was living in the darkness inside my head, I never dreamed that I would escape, that I would still be able to live the life I'd worked for and wanted for myself. It is possible. Don't give up. \u2014Ellie Hall\n\nThis month, I traveled to five new cities in three weeks. I tackled each day with enthusiasm and an expectation for great things. The energy was reciprocated; this is noteworthy because it was the first time in two years that I did not feel broken. Moving to Los Angeles was supposed to be an exciting fresh start. I was in a city people dream of moving to, with a great job that others envied. And I cried every single day. Getting out of bed was a difficult task; I struggled to get dressed and make it out the door without breaking down. Often I couldn't make it through my workday without going to the bathroom to cry. It was incredibly isolating; I knew my good Christian mother would just tell me I wasn't praying right and I needed a church home. I didn't want to call my friends because I was such a downer. I lost interest in everything. I had two moods: sad or numb, and I was disappointed in myself for having lost my ambition. After a year and a half, I finally gathered the nerve to call my pastor back home. I was scared of what she would say, but I had to tell someone how tired I was of fighting \u2014 and losing to \u2014 sadness when I seemingly had \"every reason to be happy.\" I told her I was considering therapy, and to my surprise, she agreed that it was a good idea. She said, \"Please call me anytime, I mean it, even if you just need to cry into the phone. I will sit here and listen to you cry until you tell me to hang up.\" And she meant it. Her not being judgmental gave me the courage I needed to seek help. Sometimes I felt crazy for having to pay someone to help me to not be sad. But peace of mind is so much more important than pride. I'm sure I'll get back to my ambitious plans to run the world someday soon, but for now I'm happy that my days of crying myself to sleep...awake...and asleep again are fewer than they've been in a while. \u2014Driadonna Roland\n\nDepression comes in waves. Some days it feels as though you're in a drought and some days you're drowning, swallowing water until your thoughts are soaked and decaying from the salt. On these days not much can help you. You may have dozens of people waiting on the sand bar but when it hits it is only you treading and looking for air. On these days it is important to go easy on yourself, to allow yourself to feel your feelings, free of judgment. However, it is equally important to fight back. You must pay attention to your surroundings. You must find what makes the tides subside. You must understand that you don't have to do this alone \u2014 that like waves in the water, you can't control what hits you. But you can control how you prepare yourself for them. You can decide what safety devices you'll use against it. Find a lighthouse to keep in your mind's eye in the distance. Don't be afraid to ask for help and swim on. \u2014Mackenzie Kruvant\n\nMy depression went undiagnosed for a very long time. I say undiagnosed, but I mean unrecognised. I mean ignored. Because depression isn't something we talk about. Depression is something other people have. It's easy to tell yourself you're not naturally a bright, happy person. That you're just a bit moody, a bit grumpy. That you're just a little bit down today. For a long time I tried to mask my depression, and most of the time I didn't mask it very well at all. Being afraid or unwilling to take responsibility for my mental health meant I wasn't really living. I was hiding. I was 30 when my doctor told me the things I was describing are the trappings of clinical depression, and I realised then that I had been living with this since adolescence. Fifteen years is a long time to lie to yourself that everything is OK. When ignored, depression is expensive. It has cost me friendships, opportunities, my health. It has cost me a marriage. For some people it costs them everything. But it doesn't have to. I'm not ignoring it anymore. I'm not hiding. I talk to a therapist. I exercise. I walk to work to make sure I'm getting fresh air. I try to find the joy in things. I try to laugh, to cry, to feel. It's just a start, but I'm happier for it. There isn't a cure for depression, but there are ways of coping. Silence is never one of those ways. \u2014Daniel Dalton\n\nNote: The headline was changed to more accurately reflect the content and tone of the post.", "url": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/michaelblackmon/stories-of-depression-and-suicide-that-will-inspire-you-t", "summary": "I know I'm one of the lucky ones, who responds well to medication and therapy.\nThey didn't know.\n\u2014John StantonAdvertisementThere are times when my depression has made me feel like I'm not doing anything right in my life.\nIf I can do the same for others, I know I'm doing something right.\n\u2014Chris GeidnerAdvertisementSome days depression feels like an invisible hand holding my head down.", "timescraped": 1513838606.106186, "category": {"words": 5899, "personal": 369, "thirdperson": 58, "condition": 45, "recovery": 0}}, "577a302f8a222cad3c598202f5db18aa": {"title": "13 Shocking Facts That Show How Widespread Mental Illness Is In The U.S.", "image": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2014-10/16/19/campaign_images/webdr01/13-shocking-facts-that-show-how-widespread-mental-2-6563-1413501075-21_dblbig.jpg", "text": "*Frequent Mental Distress occurs when a person suffers between 14-30 \"mentally unhealthy days\" each month.

Insel will go on to be president and cofounder of Mindstrong Health, a startup dedicated to the same subject.\n\n\n\nMore than a dozen scientists, engineers, and executives, by one count, have exited the division, called Verily, since 2014. Still, the renowned neuroscientist and psychiatrist says he left because he wanted to build a business from scratch \u2014 and not because of any issues with Verily.\n\n\u201cIt was a really hard call for me to walk away from what was a pretty idyllic and wonderful place to work,\u201d Insel told BuzzFeed News on Tuesday, minutes after he clocked out from Verily for the last time. But at some point, he said he realized, \u201c'I want to do my own thing,\u2019 [but] it\u2019s hard to do at a big company.\u201d\n\nInsel ran the mental health division of the National Institutes of Health for 13 years until he left for Silicon Valley in December 2015. He joined Verily, then known as Google X, to pioneer that subsidiary\u2019s mental health research and technology solutions. \u201cThe Google philosophy has been to seek a 10x impact on hard problems,\u201d Insel said at the time. \u201cI am looking forward to a 10x challenge in mental health.\u201d\n\nVerily just raised $800 million from Temasek Holdings, a Singaporean investment firm, which gives it more financial independence from Alphabet. It also launched the Baseline Study, to establish what healthy people\u2019s biometric data should look like, while other projects, like a glucose-monitoring contact lens and a Star Trek-like medical scanner, remain in the works. At the same time, CEO Andy Conrad appears to be toning down rhetoric about these projects being industry-changing \u201cmoonshots.\u201d As Conrad recently told Bloomberg, \u201cIf you examine the real moonshot closely, you\u2019ll see a dude whose job is to rivet and a lady whose job is to do some wiring.\u201d\n\nAt Verily, Insel said, his 10- to 15-person team was working on ways to harness smartphone sensors to track how people were using them, and to use that data to draw conclusions about their mood, behavior, and cognitive state. Mindstrong, a Palo Alto startup that\u2019s been in stealth since 2014, has a very similar mission, according to Insel.\n\nMindstrong has just seven people on staff, and details of how its technology might work are vague so far. But one possibility that excites Insel is tracking (with permission) how people use their smartphones\u2019 keyboards. \u201cYou can capture a lot of subtle details about speed, errors, choices, all of that, which are pretty good surrogates for what you would normally get with a classic neuropsychological test,\u201d Insel said. Smartphones also continually record information like location, physical activity, and sleep \u2014 all things that can change when, say, people get depressed \u2014 and that data could be used to help people manage mental illness, he said.\n\nInsel didn\u2019t specify whether this data-capturing would take the form of an app or something else. But he did say that a long-term vision of the company\u2019s is to partner with a health care system to track patients with diagnosed conditions. Mindstrong is particularly interested in depression, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder, Insel said, and has already started clinical trials in some areas.\n\n\u201cThe team just came together at Verily; it\u2019s going to be a while before they can launch into clinical trials,\u201d Insel said. \u201cMindstrong\u2019s been at this for three years; they\u2019re obviously a little bit further along.\u201d\n\nMindstrong\u2019s other founders include Executive Chairman Richard Klausner, a former director of the National Cancer Institute, and CEO Paul Dagum, who holds three patents on technologies that allow mobile devices to track and assess their users\u2019 cognitive function.\n\nThis burgeoning area of mental health research has been coined \u201cdigital phenotyping.\u201d But while it\u2019s increasingly easy to collect sensor data, showing that it can reliably reflect human behavior is the challenge, said John Torous, codirector of the digital psychiatry program at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.\n\n\u201cWhere we\u2019re seeing the bottleneck is, what are the appropriate statistical methods to handle the large amount of data, and what are the reproducible methods to show this can be done in a reproducible way?\u201d Torous told BuzzFeed News.\n\nIn a blog post Monday, Danielle Schlosser, a clinical research scientist at Verily, said the subsidiary\u2019s \u201cvision and commitment remain steadfast\u201d to treating people with depression.

Anxiety doesn't always manifest in obviously-anxious ways. It's not always shaking, sweating, or heavy breathing. Personally, when I am experiencing an episode, I tend to become grouchy. I am quicker to criticise people and just become a huge grump. If the situation persists, it can escalate into angry yelling. But I'm really just concerned about what's going on and the effect it will have on either me or my loved ones. \u2014 Taylor H, via email\n\n3. I wish that I could help my more extroverted and less anxious friends understand that I will of course be at their parties, but if I don't want to \"loosen up\" or I want to leave early, it's not because I don't love them. It's because I feel like the world is closing in on me and there's nothing I can do to stop it. \u2014 Melanie B, via email\n\n5. It's not that I don't want to talk to you. I just overthink what I'll say and how to act because I'm anxious. I don't want to embarrass myself so I just don't say anything at all. I'd like to be talked to, it's just hard for me to initiate conversation because of my anxiety. It's always great to be able to talk to someone who keeps an open mind and continues to make an effort to talk to me, because it still makes me anxious talking to people I know. It's not anything you did, it's just my own overthinking and anxiety. \u2014 ahartz6\n\n6. Mental health is something that shouldn't be ignored. It eats away at you and if you're really having a hard time, can cause you physical pain. It sucks to feel that way and have people get annoyed at you or think you do it to get out of things. I don't like feeling this way, nobody does. \u2014 laciv\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. To most people I seem to be a fully functional person. But the reality of my life is that my anxiety impacts everything I do. When my anxiety is at its worst I can't leave the house without vomiting first. How my anxiety presents itself has changed as I've aged, which makes it even harder for me to identify that I'm having a serious anxiety attack. I have found that medication can help manage my anxiety, but I still struggle to accept that I need medication when I'm feeling good and will stop taking my medication, which will send me into another spiral. I have learned to let family and close friends in and to give them permission to check in about my mental state and to remind me that my medication is important. \u2014 nicoleks\n\n9. Triggers are actually a thing, not just something the internet has made fun of. It can be as simple as someone saying something completely harmless, something that happens on TV, or what feels like deja vu. Be sensitive to these triggers, because sometimes even the person with anxiety might not even know they have them until they happen. We aren't frail people, we just have frail moments. \u2014 Rachael C\n\n11. I'm sorry if I freak you out when I spill about my anxiety. I don't want to ever make anyone feel uncomfortable, but sometimes I just need to talk to someone. It's really hard when you go through that kind of thing alone. \u2014 trinityl40257cc72\n\nAdvertisement\n\n12. A lot of people think if they can just prove to me how I'm feeling is illogical, I'll magically be cured. Honestly, it just compounds the whole thing. I already feel crazy, now other people know I am. Anxiety isn't logical and that's ok, it's valid no matter what. Feeling like I need to hide it makes it worse. \u2014 claireb49f601216\n\n14. Different situations cause different levels of anxiety, and even if two situations are very similar, that doesn't mean I'll have the same reaction to both. I could be perfectly fine going out to dinner with someone but have a very hard time just going into a grocery store. Just because you think I should be able to do something doesn't mean that I actually am able to do it or am okay with doing it. Please don't assume that since I'm okay with one thing, I'll be okay with something else. \u2014 maddipaige5\n\n15. Sometimes I seem mad and snappish but actually I'm anxious and struggling. Please don't take offense, get mad back, or try to force me to talk. I know how I'm acting, and I don't like it either. \u2014 Beca Green Watson, via Facebook\n\nAdvertisement\n\n17. Dear All My Friends, Anxiety is different for everyone. My panic attacks don't make me hyperventilate, shake, or pass out. Just because I seem calm, doesn't mean I'm okay. Sometimes I'm quiet, still, and perfectly fine. Other times, I'm quiet, still, and my brain has completely shut down. Also, I don't need to be babied. I may not be the best at handling my problems, but I CAN handle them nonetheless. Don't worrying about triggering me, and don't feel guilty if you do. One more thing: when I am in the middle of a panic attack, don't freak out or worry about me. I'll feel like a burden, and my anxiety will only get worse from there. If you really want to help, coach my breathing. Show me you care and be calm. But know this: I appreciate you, whether you breathe with me or keep away from me. I can be hard to deal with, I know, so it means a lot just to know you care. \u2014 baileys4f9a7ab0d\n\n19. There are different types of anxiety and different ways it manifests itself. Every time someone shares an article on Facebook like \"15 things every person with anxiety does!\" with a generalized list of symptoms, it only hurts the fact that some people may be struggling and you would have no idea. I have high-functioning anxiety, meaning that my anxiety manifests itself in not letting me be still and destress. I have to get everything done and I have to always be doing something and it's incredibly hard to \"relax.\" But just because when I get anxiety attacks or particularly bad days, I don't curl up in a ball unable to function, doesn't mean I'm not suffering just as badly. \u2014 hannahh451e3e2a8\n\n20. Invalidating our anxiety will not cure us. It will only make it worse. So be patient and learn to accept and adapt with us if you truly want to see us happy. \u2014 sarar4fe98030a\n\nNote: Submissions have been edited for length and/or clarity.\n\nIf you need information and practical advice on anxiety, you can call the Rethink advice and information service on 0300 5000 927 (10am\u20132pm), if you're in the UK.

First and foremost, OCD isn\u2019t necessarily an obsession with cleanliness and order. Almost every representation of people with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder I\u2019ve encountered portrays us as fearful of filth and obsessed with being clean. Melvin Udall (As Good As It Gets) keeps a stash of soap bars in his bathroom so he can unwrap a fresh one every time he washes his hands. Adrian Monk (Monk) is so crippled by his obsession with \u201ccontaminants\u201d that he needs an assistant to perform basic functions, like opening doors.\n\nThese representations build on \u2014 and give power to \u2014 the stereotype that OCD is \u201cjust\u201d a fear of dirt and an obsession with order. This limited definition of OCD makes it difficult for people whose OCD manifests in other ways to be recognized. There are few things as frustrating as working up the courage to admit to someone that you have OCD and have them doubtfully respond, \u201cBut you\u2019re so messy!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n \nEven though I\u2019m not obsessed with monsters under the bed anymore, when something unpleasant comes up, like getting called in for jury duty, my mind automatically brings me to the irrational worst case. The thing is, I have a very hard time discerning between what\u2019s likely \u2014 or even possible \u2014 to happen and what isn\u2019t. That\u2019s how I end up crying on my therapist\u2019s couch because I really believe that I\u2019ll be stuck in jury duty for months and will lose my job and my apartment. No matter what she says to allay my fears, I never really believe that I\u2019m safe, so the thought of losing everything keeps returning to consume me. I become absolutely convinced that whatever I\u2019m afraid of will come true. This is where the compulsive behaviors come in. When you\u2019re drowning in anxiety, you want to be able to do something to control it, right? With intrusive thoughts, simply doing some research and discovering that your fears are unwarranted doesn\u2019t help \u2014 or it helps for about three minutes until the intrusive thoughts push back in. Thus, OCD patients develop repetitive behaviors that help us feel like we\u2019re in control, that we\u2019re actively preventing something bad from happening.\n\n3. An OCD patient\u2019s intrusive thoughts can manifest in seemingly unrelated behavior. Sometimes my compulsive behaviors are a practical response to my anxieties, but usually they\u2019re not. In the case of the jury duty anxiety (and I should stress that jury duty is not the only thing that triggers my OCD \u2014 the list is long, with most items being a little too personal to share publicly), I might stay up far too late combing online forums for horror stories about the jury duty that never ended, or compulsively call my boss, my HR department, and my union to confirm that I\u2019ll still get paid on the days I miss work. These behaviors usually allay my anxiety briefly, until my brain conjures up something else that could go wrong. For example, if HR assures me that I won\u2019t lose my job while I\u2019m on jury duty, I might find myself, half an hour later, on hold with my union because I\u2019ve been overcome with the thought that HR was wrong and I want to confirm that the union will protect me. Usually, however, my compulsive behaviors have nothing to do in practice with whatever I\u2019m afraid of. This is because they are not a rational response to a real problem \u2013 they are compulsive manifestations of an irrational anxiety. For example, if I\u2019m worried that jury duty will snowball into an apocalyptic scenario of joblessness and homelessness, I might respond to these intrusive thoughts by getting stuck washing my hands over and over because in my irrational mind, washing my hands while envisioning a positive outcome (dismissal from jury duty) will make that outcome a reality. If I spend twenty minutes washing my hands, it\u2019s not because I\u2019m afraid they\u2019re dirty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. I do rationally understand that a compulsive behavior won\u2019t solve whatever I\u2019m worried about. That doesn\u2019t mean I can stop. I often think of living with OCD as having two minds: the rational mind, which knows that hand-washing will have no impact on the outcome of my jury duty, and the irrational mind, possessed by that same monster-under-the-bed terror, that makes the idea of a long jury duty feel like both a catastrophe and something whose outcome could be mitigated by how many times I wash my hands. Rationally, I know that my compulsive behaviors will have no effect on what I\u2019m worried about. I\u2019m even able to admit this while I\u2019m stuck in a cycle of repetitive behavior. But irrational fear usually wins its battles with my rational mind, and the magical thinking that my compulsive behaviors will keep me safe influences my behavior more often than not. 5. Getting lost in compulsive behaviors can feel like torture. Unfortunately, the compulsive behaviors my brain uses to process these anxieties often have the effect of intensifying them rather than making them more manageable. They catch me in a cycle where my fears seem immediate, and thus become quickly overpowering. This is how I end up standing in the doorway of my bedroom for five, ten, fifteen minutes past when I wanted to be in bed because I have to keep switching the light on and off until it feels \u201cright.\u201d\n\nEven though I consciously know that my bedroom light has nothing to do with what I\u2019m worried about, the little doubt at the back of my mind \u2013 But what if it does? What if switching off the light while imagining the perfect outcome will make everything okay? Did you do it right? Did you really imagine it? Do it again \u2013 grows louder and more insistent. The more room I give to that doubt, the more urgent the compulsions seem, until the idea that I can make everything okay by switching the light off the \u201cright\u201d way \u2013 and, conversely, that everything will be a disaster if I don\u2019t \u2013 dominates me. OCD is often described as an obsession with control, and it is. But there is a dark side to imagining that you have control over everything. I constantly feel the pressure to do even small things, like washing my hands or flipping off the bedroom light, in a way that will magically enact a positive outcome in something I\u2019m worried about. This makes basic tasks really, really difficult, especially because my compulsive behaviors could be anything. On my good days, I can clean my apartment, organize my desk, and cook dinner with minimal problems. At other times, it takes me hours to do the dishes because I need to put the same cup in the cabinet five times before I feel safe enough to move on. I\u2019ve become a night owl because the process of getting ready for bed \u2013 brushing my teeth, taking out the trash, changing into pajamas, turning out the light, getting into bed \u2013 can be so time-consuming and stressful that I procrastinate doing it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. It is possible to live with OCD and be very high-functioning, especially with the right treatment. One of the biggest objections I have to the way OCD has been traditionally represented in the media is that, for the most part, characters with OCD are presented as misanthropic, consumed by their obsessions and, even if they\u2019re brilliant or good at their job, are otherwise not equal to the basic challenges life presents. Surely this is true for some \u2014 it has even described me at certain points in my life. But a troubling effect of these representations is that they make an OCD diagnosis seem like a kind of death sentence. When I was diagnosed at age 11, I was terrified it meant that I would not be able to live a full life. Yet, thanks to consistent therapy and the right dosage of anti-anxiety medication, I am able to keep my OCD in check enough to live a \u201crelatively normal life\u201d (whatever that means). For the most part, the worst of my OCD symptoms don\u2019t come into play when I\u2019m at work or with friends and family. When I started writing about it earlier this year, most of the people in my life were surprised to discover that I have OCD at all. 7. It actually has its benefits. Would I get rid of my OCD if I could? It\u2019s a moot question: as every therapist, psychologist, psychiatrist, and social worker I\u2019ve seen has reminded me, the goal of OCD treatment isn\u2019t to cure it, but to manage it. However, despite the suffering it has caused me, if someone presented me with a magical cure for OCD and all its related symptoms tomorrow, I would hesitate. Of course, I would want to get rid of the anxiety, the fact that I can\u2019t really trust myself when assessing risk, the compulsions that occasionally embarrass me in public and keep me up at night. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to encounter the world without an anxiety disorder on my back, and I would like to try it.\n\nBut I have also come to understand that the pitfalls of OCD come as part of a larger package. Because I have had OCD from the beginning \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t triggered by a specific trauma later in life, as some cases of OCD are \u2014 I have developed with and around it. As a result, some aspects of my personality and the way I think are of a piece with my OCD. From childhood, I have obsessively-compulsively deconstructed and responded to arguments: if I had an opinion about something, I searched ruthlessly for potential counterarguments in order to control the responses of my naysayers before they even opened their mouths. I won awards as a leader of the Model UN debate team at my high school, and now I teach argumentation and rhetoric for a living. I am meticulously organized, obsessively thorough, and deeply inquisitive. It\u2019s a running joke among my in-laws that, if they want to schedule something with my husband, they should just call me because I\u2019ve got a color-coded calendar that runs six months out. At work, I\u2019m the note-taker in every working group, and I stumbled into labor activism because I was anxious about my eligibility for health coverage and annotated the union contract. My perfectionism makes me an excellent student and teacher \u2014 I am easily engrossed in new tasks, excellent at managing my time and completing projects efficiently, and as a result, am a natural leader and delegator. I have an uncanny memory for dates because I track the landscape of my life in terms of what I was obsessed with at any given point. For example, I remember the exact start date of every job I\u2019ve ever had because I remember the ways that my anxiety about starting new jobs manifested at different points in my life. It would be shortsighted to say that these attributes are separate from my OCD, because the habits of mind involved in these strengths are very similar (and in some cases, are the very same) as the habits of mind that drive me to brush my teeth five times before going to bed. I\u2019ve come to view OCD as a (very) rough downside to characteristics that I otherwise quite like about myself. So, while I\u2019d be kidding myself if I claimed that I\u2019d turn down a cure for OCD wholesale, I\u2019ve learned to stop trying to separate my mental illness from the rest of who I am, to be ashamed of it, or to shun it. In some ways, it\u2019s convenient that my OCD isn\u2019t going away, because it means that I can continue to learn to draw on it as a source of strength, while minimizing the ways that it can hurt me.\n\nShannon Azzato Stephens is a writer based in New York City, where she teaches college-level writing and spends most of her free time at the dog park.\n\nTo learn more about OCD, check out the resources at the National Institute of Mental Health here.

Not because of the responsibilities leading up to Mental Health Week, but because not feeling okay and managing that not-okayness is part of my daily reality. And the thing is, most people I know aren't totally okay either. It feels weird to say, because it was only so long ago that I felt isolated with my issues: clinical depression and anxiety, chronic suicidal ideation, a history of self-harm \u2014 all things I put a lot of effort into hiding before it was my literal job to talk about it. But now I am surrounded by friends, family, roommates, coworkers, BuzzFeed readers and commenters, and strangers whose essays and blog posts I read daily, all who have their own mental health struggles to share. This is a thing we talk about now, that is normal to talk about now.\n\nSo, one of the questions I've asked myself as we put together BuzzFeed's Mental Health Week is: Why are we doing it again, when talking about mental health no longer feels as taboo?\n\nWhen BuzzFeed launched its first Mental Health Week in 2015, the conversation around mental health had recently begun to shift: Instead of viewing their mental health struggles as shameful secrets, people were slowly growing more and more comfortable admitting they weren't okay, sharing their experiences, and most importantly, seeking professional help.\n\nWe've come an incredibly long way from just a few years ago when even talking about mental health outside of the clinical and abstract felt revolutionary. You no longer have to dig into niche websites to find regular mental health coverage. Self-care, mental health days, and therapy are all a comfortable part of our cultural vocabulary. And to be honest, with the way 2017 has been going, it sometimes feels like you're in the minority if you're not struggling with feelings of depression, anxiety, or at least some heavy existential dread.\n\nBut even with a widespread acceptance of mental health as something that can \u2014 and should \u2014 be openly discussed, the stigma is far from gone. Certain disorders and experiences still fall to the wayside because they're less common, less palatable, less relatable, or hey, even less easily packaged into a BuzzFeed list. We're still hungry for accurate, compassionate, and diverse depictions of mental illness in the media. We can still push conversations about depression, anxiety, self-care, and general mental health to be more inclusive, more frequent, more comfortable. And just because we're talking more about mental health treatment doesn't mean it's always easy or accessible. Where mental health is concerned, there will always be more to talk about.\n\nThis week, coinciding with Mental Illness Awareness Week, we're publishing a full lineup dedicated to exploring stories of mental health, illness, and treatment, as well as expert-sourced tips that can help anyone feel a little more okay.

This is, my psychiatrist reasons, what has kept me functioning for the last two years without hallucinations or delusions. But for most of 2013, I was a psychotic wreck. I refer to it as My Death Year. My beloved grandfather died, and I was too crazy to attend the funeral; also, the year ended with a serious bout of psychosis called Cotard\u2019s Delusion that led me to believe that I was dead. I spent most of that year spinning in and out of different harrowing beliefs: there were spiders in my brain, my husband had poisoned my tea, there were cameras spying on me in every corner of the flat, and so on.\n\n2013 was also the year that I surrendered my last benchmark of sanity, otherwise known as my full-time job at a fast-paced startup company. For years, holding down an office job had been what I believed sincerely, and perhaps a bit desperately, separated me from others of my ilk, but I stepped away from my 9-to-5 because my job, despite its accommodations and allowances, exacerbated my illness.\n\nIn 2006, as a senior at Stanford who had transferred from Yale, I began to exhibit symptoms of schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, which can be described as a marriage of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Schizoaffective disorder is listed under Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders in the DSM-5 and is not one of the five subcategories of schizophrenia itself. However, they both share the 295 designation, of which there are three disorders \u2014 schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, and schizoaffective disorder \u2014 and are therefore considered closely related.\n\nAnd yet my official diagnosis \u2014 the one recorded in my HMO\u2019s vast database of patient information \u2014 didn\u2019t change to schizoaffective disorder until I became so desperately ill that I was referred for an electroconvulsive therapy consultation. The disorder had been suspected, but not recorded, in part because schizoaffective disorder has a gloomier prognosis and stigma than bipolar disorder does, and even psychiatrists are susceptible to being swayed by the implications of a different DSM code; also, psychiatry operates by treating symptoms and not a root cause, and so my psychopharmacological treatment was not impacted by the change in my chart.\n\nIn Blue Nights, Joan Didion remarks, \u201cI have not yet seen that case in which a \u2018diagnosis\u2019 led to a \u2018cure,\u2019 or in fact to any outcome other than a confirmed, and therefore an enforced, debility.\u201d Living under the shadow of a new \u201ccode\u201d bore no curative function, but it did imply that to be high-functioning would be difficult, and it warned me that to live beyond that code would be a tricky gambit. A therapist had already told me in my mid-twenties that I was her only client who was able to hold down a full-time job. Having a job, among psychiatric researchers, is considered one of the major characteristics of being a high-functioning person.\n\nDuring my first inpatient experience at a psychiatric hospital, I met two patients who were treated as markedly different from the rest of us \u2014 I will call them Pauline and Laura. Pauline was middle-aged and chatty; Laura was the only other Asian woman on the ward, and spoke to no one. We patients rarely spoke of our diagnoses \u2014 at the time, I was labeled as having bipolar disorder, with traits of borderline personality disorder \u2014 but everyone knew that Pauline and Laura were the two with schizophrenia.\n\nPauline was friendly and would roll up in her wheelchair speaking disjointed monologues about the psychiatrists\u2019 \u201cmind control experiments\u201d \u2014 her ramblings paranoid enough to be considered psychotic, yet realistic enough to be unsettling to a vulnerable mind. In less coherent periods, her stories dissolved into the verbal nonsense known as \u201cword salad,\u201d in which one word was only tenuously related to the one that came before it, and the lot of them as a whole meant nothing at all. These problems with communication caused her to be excluded, by doctors\u2019 decree, from otherwise mandatory group therapy sessions. I treated Pauline as though she had a contagion; after every interaction, I was contaminated by the anxiety that I was just like her even though I hadn\u2019t, at that time, yet experienced psychosis. Perhaps I sensed it thrumming in myself even back then.\n\nAnd then there was Laura, whom I never interacted with, because I was afraid of her and what madness her existence implied; but I remember her yelling as she was pulled out of the hall bathroom, interrupted in an attempt to vomit up her medications. \u201cThey\u2019re poison!\u201d she screamed as two nurses yanked at her arms. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to poison me! They\u2019re trying to kill me!\u201d\n\nA natural hierarchy arose in the hospital, guided by both our own sense of functionality and the functionality perceived by the doctors, nurses, and social workers that treated us. Depressives, who constituted most of the ward\u2019s population, were at the top of the chain, whether or not they were receiving ECT (electroconvulsive therapy). Because we were in the Yale Psychiatric Institute (now known as the Yale Psychiatric Hospital), many of those hospitalized with depression were Yalies, and therefore considered bright people who\u2019d simply wound up in a bad situation. In the middle were those with anorexia and bipolar disorder \u2014 two disorders not necessarily linked by nature, but lumped together from a lack of other diagnoses on the ward. I was considered to be in this group, and perhaps even as highly ranked as the depressives because of my status as a student at Yale. The ones with schizophrenia, on the other hand, landed at the rock bottom \u2014 excluded from group therapy, seen as lunatic and raving, and incapable of fitting into the requirements of normalcy.\n\nI\u2019ve seen the psychiatric hierarchy elsewhere \u2014 a hierarchy of who can be seen as high-functioning and \u201cgifted,\u201d and who can be seen as not being capable of either. A much-liked meme on Facebook circulated months ago, in which a chart listed so-called advantages to various mental illnesses. Depression bestowed sensitivity and empathy; ADHD allowed people to hold large amounts of information at once; anxiety created useful caution. I knew before reading it that schizophrenia wouldn\u2019t make an appearance. As with most marginalized groups, there are those who are considered more socially appropriate than others. Being seen as inevitable failures by the dominant culture causes a desire to distance yourself from other, similarly marginalized people who are seen as even less capable of success.\n\nThe book Furiously Happy: A Funny Book About Horrible Things, by Jenny Lawson, was recommended to me over and over again as a hilarious book that embraced those with mental illness. Lawson, the beloved blogger behind The Bloggess, has been diagnosed with a variety of conditions, including depression and avoidant personality disorder. Yet she explains early on in Furiously Happy that she is on antipsychotics \u2014 not because she is psychotic, but because it decreases the length of her depressive episodes. \u201cThere is nothing better than hearing that there is a drug that will fix a terrible problem,\u201d she writes, \u201cunless you also hear that the drug is for treating schizophrenia (or possibly that it kills fairies every time you take it).\u201d That line, for me, drew a line in the sand: My psychiatric condition, and the medications I take for it, make me as bad as a fairy killer; but if I were taking Haldol as a \u201cside dish\u201d for depression, I\u2019d remain on the proper side of crazy.\n\nLawson, I\u2019d like to believe, is trying to be honest rather than mean-spirited. No one wants to be crazy, least of all truly crazy \u2014 as in, psychotic. According to stereotype, schizophrenics are seen as some of the most dysfunctional members of society: We are homeless, we are inscrutable, and we are murderers. We are mass shooters like James Holmes, Jiverly Wong, Maj. Nidal Hasan, and Jared Loughner. Less headline-grabbing are people such as Elyn Saks, a recipient of the MacArthur \u201cgenius\u201d grant who is a University of Southern California law professor, advocate, and author of a critically acclaimed memoir about life with schizophrenia. In a 2008 paper, Saks recalls, \u201cWhen I was examined for readmission to Yale Law School, the psychiatrist suggested I might spend a year working at a low-level job, perhaps in fast food, which would allow me to consolidate my gains so that I could do better when I was readmitted.\u201d The criteria for being able to return to a top-ranking law school, it seems, is being able to have a job, thus proving that you\u2019ve returned to productivity \u2014 yet having schizophrenia is seen as canceling out the abilities that allowed someone like Saks to get into law school in the first place.\n\nBut Saks is exceptional. My desire to put myself on par with a genius grant winner says something about my ambition; it also says something about my desire to separate myself from the reality of those who are not living well with schizophrenia, and who would struggle to work in any capacity. While fighting with my insurance company over disability benefits, I tearfully tried to explain that I can\u2019t work at McDonald\u2019s, but I can run a business based on freelance work; place me in a high-stress environment with no ability to control my environment or my schedule, and I will rapidly begin to decompensate vis-\u00e0-vis demonic hallucinations. Being able to work for myself, while still challenging, allows greater freedom in my schedule and exerts less pressure on my mind. Like Saks, I am high-functioning, but I\u2019m a high-functioning person with an unpredictable and low-functioning illness. I think of this while contemplating Susan, a woman described in Andrew Solomon\u2019s book Far From the Tree, who is described as responding well to antipsychotic medication: \u201cIntermittently, I have little things trigger here and there, but they only last a day or two. ... Some people get stressed and their back goes out. I get stressed and my mind goes out. But then it comes back.\u201d I may not be the \u201cappropriate\u201d type of crazy. Sometimes, my mind does go out, leaving me frightened of poison in my tea or corpses in the parking lot. But then it comes back.\n\nBecause I am capable of achievement, I find myself uncomfortable around visibly psychotic people, or people with schizophrenia who are expected to never rise above a certain level on the Global Assessment of Functioning. My tendency to avoid the Paulines and Lauras of the world remains with me, and has in fact strengthened, even after my diagnosis shifted to more closely match theirs. I\u2019m uncomfortable because I don\u2019t want to be lumped in with the screaming man on the bus, or the woman who speaks in loose associations at the mental health clinic. I\u2019m uncomfortable because I know that these, in many ways, are my people in ways that those who have never experienced psychosis can\u2019t understand, and to shun them is to shun a large part of myself. In my mind, there is a line between myself and those like Pauline and Laura; to others, that line is thin, or is so negligible as to not be a line at all.", "url": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/esmewwang/who-gets-to-be-the-good-schizophrenic", "summary": "Schizoaffective disorder is listed under Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders in the DSM-5 and is not one of the five subcategories of schizophrenia itself.\nHowever, they both share the 295 designation, of which there are three disorders \u2014 schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, and schizoaffective disorder \u2014 and are therefore considered closely related.\nAnd yet my official diagnosis \u2014 the one recorded in my HMO\u2019s vast database of patient information \u2014 didn\u2019t change to schizoaffective disorder until I became so desperately ill that I was referred for an electroconvulsive therapy consultation.\nHaving a job, among psychiatric researchers, is considered one of the major characteristics of being a high-functioning person.\nBecause we were in the Yale Psychiatric Institute (now known as the Yale Psychiatric Hospital), many of those hospitalized with depression were Yalies, and therefore considered bright people who\u2019d simply wound up in a bad situation.", "timescraped": 1513838589.969151, "category": {"words": 1873, "personal": 66, "thirdperson": 26, "condition": 8, "recovery": 5}}, "6da4f05c5494d840a1039e44c87a17f0": {"title": "22 Women On Instagram Who Will Inspire Your Health And Fitness Journey", "image": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2017-09/19/20/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-02/22-women-on-instagram-who-will-inspire-your-healt-2-14774-1505866385-0_dblbig.jpg", "text": "Instagram is honestly really great, and can be a perfect way to motivate yourself.

BPD can make it incredibly difficult to regulate your emotions. \"I am extremely sensitive to emotional stimuli \u2014 emotional hypersensitivity is the core of my experience of BPD. Because of this, the speed at which my emotions fluctuate is breathtaking, and they tend to be extremes of emotion, such as elation or utter despair.

BPD doesn't make people inherently mean or angry. \"Most people with BPD that I've met are very gentle souls; they're very kind people. It's a sensitive brain combined with either trauma or invalidation. A lot of people have the impression that BPD folks are just assholes, just because the people who lash out are the loudest. The quiet ones are either misdiagnosed, or they're just quiet. And there's millions of us. Most us are very decent, sensitive people, and we don't like hurting people.

People with BPD can't just choose to be a different way. \"People who suffer with BPD do not choose to be this way.

And they're not doing this for attention. \"I have encountered a large amount of stigma throughout my illness, mainly from people who assume that I have chosen to behave in a certain way for attention (normally surrounding self-harming or suicidal behaviors).

People with BPD can go through years of misdiagnoses \u2014 and it's incredibly disheartening. \"I was diagnosed bipolar a couple times, major depression, general mood disorders, but nothing felt right. When one doctor finally said it sounded like BPD, and the more I learned about it, the more I read about it, I was like \u2014 this is me. Finally I'm home; I have a diagnosis.

Once that diagnosis comes, it can still be an exhausting process trying to find help for it. \"It's been a lot of handing off.

But just one supportive health professional can make a world of difference. \"I eventually developed a life-changing relationship with a psychologist \u2014 the first and only mental health professional who competently and compassionately responded to my presentation of BPD.

BPD can make it really hard to maintain relationships. \"BPD has an enormous impact on my personal relationships. Because I am so emotionally sensitive, I can often overreact to things that friends or family do or say and might then behave in a way that is unhelpful to both me and the other person. This makes maintaining friendships very difficult.\" \u2014Andrea Shaw, email \"The very essence of BPD is that it has a direct impact on your ability to communicate, and maintain relationships with the people closest to you. You pull people in close in an intense relationship, and then with no warning push them away as hard as possible. This cycle repeats over and over again because, until you get treatment, you lack the skills to maintain relationships at a functional level. On top of that, BPD causes a large fear of abandonment \u2014 think, 'I hate you, don't leave me!'\" \u2014SF Share On email Share On email\n\nShare On link Share On link Share This Link\n\nShare On facebook Share On facebook Share\n\n13. But it may even make your emotional ties stronger. \"I've had the privilege of spending most of the past decade in long-term, committed relationships with people \u2014 people whom I've loved fiercely, and who have loved me back just as fiercely.

Trust is hugely important. \"Something that helps is my rock-solid relationship with my husband.

I was left feeling worthless and unlovable, with major trust issues. I live in constant fear of being rejected by the people I love, and make frantic efforts to prevent it.\" \u2014Marra Yates Share On email Share On email\n\nShare On link Share On link Share This Link\n\nShare On facebook Share On facebook Share\n\nAdvertisement\n\n15. So is validation. \"For many years, ever since I was around 12, my parents thought that I was just trying to get attention using my behaviors \u2014 self-harm, crying spells, depressive symptoms. They didn't believe I had a problem, so for a long time they didn't support my treatment and didn't want to pay for my treatment. It was really hard; I felt really invalidated for a long time.\" \u2014EH Share On email Share On email\n\nShare On link Share On link Share This Link\n\nShare On facebook Share On facebook Share\n\n16. And patience. \"I am lucky to be in a relationship with someone patient, who will understand when I 'overreact' to things like taking too long to text me back. To me, canceling a dinner date may as well be breaking up. And seeing my best friend spend time with her coworker makes me believe that I am alone and unloved. I can't help feeling this way, but I do my best to not let BPD keep me from living a normal life and forming healthy relationships.\" \u2014MY Share On email Share On email\n\nShare On link Share On link Share This Link\n\nShare On facebook Share On facebook Share\n\n17. Some forms of therapy work better than others \u2014 it depends on the patient, and the practitioner. \"Cognitive behavioral therapy doesn't go far enough for me. I'm not dissing it \u2014 I think for certain people it works great. In DBT [Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, a specific kind of therapy developed for people with BPD], the skills are aimed at exactly what we deal with. The core of it is mindfulness. It's also much more intensive than other therapies. It's at least a year, and you go twice a week, once in a group or class, and also one-on-one with a therapist. And your therapist is your coach, almost like a sponsor in AA. If you start dysregulating and you're about to freak out or do something stupid \u2014 whether it be cutting yourself or drinking or lashing out \u2014 you call them and they talk you down. They don't engage with anger, or ignore you, which other people do and only makes things worse. It's basically a rewiring of the brain \u2014 and if you practice, practice, practice every day, you'll get good at it. It changes your behavior, and your thinking. It just works for me.\" \u2014RC Share On email Share On email\n\nShare On link Share On link Share This Link\n\nShare On facebook Share On facebook Share\n\n18. But there's often a waiting list for DBT, which can make getting treatment difficult. \"Treatment for BPD in the UK is very patchy and non-existent in many localities. The mainstay of treatment is DBT or a couple of other specialised psychotherapies, and in many areas it just isn't available, or is extremely heavily rationed so that only a tiny proportion of those diagnosed with BPD get access to it. I personally have not had any BPD-specific treatment since being officially diagnosed almost five years ago.\" \u2014Andrea Shaw, email \"The only really well-known treatment for it is DBT \u2014 which, even if you live in a town that offers it, you have to go on a waiting list. Some of it is because they don't have the room, but a lot of it is insurance stuff. For a while I was able to do it, traveling three hours up to Cincinnati, paying out of pocket, and it really helped. But I had to stop for personal reasons, go on disability. I'm back on a waiting list \u2014 also waiting for my Medicaid \u2014 but I'll at least be eligible again in March. It feels like I'm treading water. I just want to be my old, normal self again.\" \u2014RC Share On email Share On email\n\nShare On link Share On link Share This Link\n\nShare On facebook Share On facebook Share\n\nAdvertisement\n\n19. This can make it feel like people with BPD have to fend for themselves. \"When I was diagnosed with BPD and I researched it, I realized that I really needed to get myself some DBT. Sadly the waiting list in my area for this therapy was more than two years, so I decided to buy some books written by Marsha Linehan (the creator of DBT) which were aimed at therapists \u2014 and teach myself the therapy.\" \u2014SF Share On email Share On email\n\nShare On link Share On link Share This Link\n\nShare On facebook Share On facebook Share\n\n20. Sometimes the most important factor in recovery is love, support, and reassurance. \"People with BPD want and need to be loved, but their behavior can push and drive the people closest to them away. They end up alone, scared and consequently cannot see the point in continuing. What they need is the support and empathy to get the help they need, and hopefully more sufferers can follow the path I eventually did \u2014 to recovery.\" \u2014SF Share On email Share On email\n\nShare On link Share On link Share This Link\n\nShare On facebook Share On facebook Share\n\n21. If we don't talk about BPD \u2014 and break the stigma \u2014 it might keep people from getting help. \"Stigma is the reason, more so than the actual impediments of symptoms, that I've struggled in my career; and it's the reason BPD research, treatment development, peer support, and community resources are so underfunded.\" \u2014MHF Share On email Share On email\n\nShare On link Share On link Share This Link\n\nShare On facebook Share On facebook Share\n\n22. Visibility matters. \"I really do want to recover, and I'm taking all the steps I can to work toward recovery, and I've seen it happen in other people. It gives me hope that maybe it could happen for me.\" \u2014EH Share On email Share On email\n\nShare On link Share On link Share This Link\n\nShare On facebook Share On facebook Share\n\n23. People with BPD are stronger than you know. \"My extreme emotional reactions are so ingrained in my brain that I can't prevent myself from experiencing them, and instead I have to manage them. Living with BPD is incredibly hard work and anyone who manages to stay alive in the face of such intense pain is a hero in my book.\" \u2014AS Share On email Share On email\n\nShare On link Share On link Share This Link\n\nShare On facebook Share On facebook Share\n\nResponses have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWant help looking and feeling your best?

Maybe you'd like a better understanding of it, or maybe you worry you\u2019re excluded from it because of how you look or feel about yourself. Share On email Share On email\n\nShare On link Share On link Share This Link\n\nShare On facebook Share On facebook Share\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is body positivity, anyway? Body positivity is unlearning the idea that only certain bodies are worth acceptance and praise, and instead recognizing that all bodies are equally valuable. It's deciding what feels good and healthy for you personally, and letting other people do so for themselves. It's understanding that you deserve to live in your body without receiving the prejudice of others (whether that means rude comments, reduced economic opportunity, inadequate health care, or something else), and working toward a world where no one's body is the target of such bias. Share On email Share On email\n\nShare On link Share On link Share This Link\n\nShare On facebook Share On facebook Share\n\nFirst off, it doesn't make you immune to the pressures society places on your body. Listen: We're all humans, and we've all been affected by the world around us. It's completely normal and okay to have bad body-image days, and beating yourself up over it will only make you feel worse. All you can do is try to be kind to yourself (maybe some of this stuff will help), and always stand up for other people who are being treated unfairly because of social attitudes toward their bodies. And if you feel like loud, proud body love would be too awkward or performative of an act for you personally, you may want to investigate body neutrality. Share On email Share On email\n\nShare On link Share On link Share This Link\n\nShare On facebook Share On facebook Share\n\nOkay, moving on! Modern body positivity is for people of any size. I can't tell you how often I read comments like, \"Body positivity is only for plus-size women.\" Then again, there are certainly fitspo Instagrammers and other straight (not plus-) size people who claim the only way to be truly body-positive is to eat and work out until you look more or less like them. Which, BTW, isn't an option for everyone even if they choose to follow a particular regimen, since not everyone's bodies respond to food and activity in the same way. In actuality, living a body-positive life means embracing principles of acceptance regardless of size. That goes for your own body, and everyone else's too. Share On email Share On email\n\nShare On link Share On link Share This Link\n\nShare On facebook Share On facebook Share\n\n(Although this gets a little tricky.) The roots of body positivity can be found in the fat acceptance movement, which supports the liberation of fat bodies and fights against stigma surrounding them. But the colloquial definition of body positivity has been broadened \u2014 as some see it, diluted \u2014 to encompass bodies that haven't traditionally been the target of such disproportionate bias. Today, the term is often stripped of its principles for use as a corporate catchphrase (more on this below), leading many activists disillusioned with the commercialization of their beliefs to assert themselves clearly as \"fat-positive\" instead. [Also, now seems like a pertinent time to note, for anyone who's unclear on it: \"Promoting obesity\" is not a thing. Obesity is not a club that, if the right number of proverbial flyers are handed out, people line up to get into. Living joyfully in one's body and not hesitating to share those joyful moments with others, or giving representation to people who aren't normally visible in media, only \"promotes\" not delaying happiness until you reach a certain dress size or number on a scale.] Share On email Share On email\n\nShare On link Share On link Share This Link\n\nShare On facebook Share On facebook Share\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt also doesn't make you vain or vapid. Accepting and loving your body doesn't mean your outside is the most important part about you, or that you cease working to improve your nonphysical qualities. For me, adopting body-positive ideals actually freed up my mind to learn more about what I want out of life, to open myself up more to others, and to work on gaining knowledge and skills I hadn't gotten around to when I was all-consumed with the size of my thighs. Which is not to suggest that embracing your own physicality is where the journey ends, because true body positivity still means working toward the empowerment (emotional, economic, and beyond) of others. Still, it's worth acknowledging that loving your own body doesn't make you selfish. Share On email Share On email\n\nShare On link Share On link Share This Link\n\nShare On facebook Share On facebook Share\n\nAnd it doesn't come with caveats. It would be handy to sort people into two groups: the blatantly, outspokenly not body-positive, and the good guys. But like dudes who neighbors describe as \"nice\" and \"quiet\" after the discovery of severed heads in their freezers, people's prejudices around size, shape, and associated traits and behaviors often come in insidious packaging. The #BodyPositiveBut tag shed light on the problem of people who claim body positivity to advance their own status, while cherry-picking its tenets and leaving behind \u2014 or being outright harmful toward \u2014 people more vulnerable and underrepresented than themselves. The truth is, actual body positivity isn't reserved for people under a certain size, or people who eat or exercise a certain way. It's not just for hourglass-shaped people, or people with light skin, or people who fit neatly into hetero- or cisnormative boxes, or people who walk without a cane, or people who walk at all. It's \"body positivity\" \u2014 not \"only my body positivity,\" not \"bodies like mine positivity,\" not \"bodies that given my social conditioning I'm immediately 100% comfortable with positivity.\" Actual body positivity includes everyone. Challenging? Sure; it sucks being confronted with your biases. But that's what it is. Anything else is simply a parroted acknowledgement of the recent, very slight broadening of beauty standards in media, wrapped in a brilliantly marketable and of-the-moment bow.

Let me be doubly clear on this: Body-shaming is never acceptable. Okay, great. Now that that's out of the way, it's important to understand how shaming and stigma manifest differently around different kinds of bodies. For example, thin people may receive insults and even concern-trolling (i.e., \"Eat a sandwich!\"), while larger people receive those things as well as facing assumptions of moral failure (gluttony, laziness, stupidity, etc.), discriminatory employment and labor practices, and frequent prejudice and even refusal of treatment from doctors. People with illnesses and disabilities face similar structural issues and assumptions, not to mention the simple lack of accessibility in many parts of the world (you can read more about that here). Even within the spectrum of marginalized bodies, some are more privileged than others. For instance, clothing is more readily available for a size 12 than a size 24, and for a size 24 than a size 32, and the idea of the \"right\" way to carry fat (read: an hourglass figure, not an \"apple shape\") is so pervasive that San Francisco's employment laws stipulate that not only can employers not discriminate based on weight, but also on how said weight is distributed. Fascinating, huh? Well, fascinating and enraging.

While I'm never going to believe that random loudmouth (or keyboard) strangers give a shit about the \"health\" of people they don't know, it's obvious that we all worry about the people we do know and love. If you're legitimately concerned about the well-being of a family member or close friend based on their size or behaviors assumed to be associated with size \u2014 not just itching to criticize their appearance \u2014 you can compassionately state your concerns, ask if they're okay, and volunteer your help if they want it. This stuff is not all for the purpose of \"political correctness\" or \"censorship\"; it simply requires a mature-adult amount of nuance. Talk to the people you love. Make it clear how much they actually mean to you. Listen to what they say. True caring requires that kind of intimacy. Share On email Share On email\n\nShare On link Share On link Share This Link\n\nShare On facebook Share On facebook Share\n\nAnd you don't have to be attracted to everybody. Sometimes I think people are so reluctant to embrace body positivity because they're afraid, even if they don't realize it, that they'll somehow get led into a trap where they have to fuck people they're not into. But since body positivity is about working toward equity for different kinds of bodies, and about people taking ownership of their own bodies, its principles actually empower people to voice consent (or lack thereof), should they be in a situation that warrants it. (Which is a totally different thing than loudly proclaiming what you're not attracted to outside of such a situation, or shaming other people for what they're into. Hint: Nobody cares!) Bottom line: You can treat people with sensitivity and respect even if you're not attracted to them, and anyone who attempts to pressure you into romantic or sexual activity under the guise of supposed \"body positivity\" is wrong, to say the least. And to say more, is an asshole. Share On email Share On email\n\nShare On link Share On link Share This Link\n\nShare On facebook Share On facebook Share\n\nThough TBH, you should maybe think about why you like who you like. If you're exclusively or primarily attracted to, say, white, cis dudes over 6 feet tall and under 250 pounds who don't have disabilities, that's your right (although, again, please don't make a whole thing of it). While you can't necessarily \"reprogram\" yourself to be attracted to a wider range of people, though, it's important to examine whether your preferences are a result of nefarious social conditioning. Are you truly personally not attracted to women with armpit hair, or have you just internalized razor companies' messages that women aren't supposed to have armpit hair? The beauty of putting body positivity into practice is it encourages you to understand that you have options instead of imperatives, so you can figure out the things you actually want rather than just what you're supposed to want. And who knows? Questioning what you've previously thought to be objectively true might open the doors to some amazing, sexy people.

When some people use the word \"health,\" they actually mean thinness. When others use it, they take into account that a) you can't tell how healthy someone is simply by looking at them, and b) mental well-being, which is a huge part of health, can be negatively affected by personal and societal messages about what bodies \"should\" be. Similarly, \"curvy\" is an empowering word for a lot of people, while others prefer straight-up \"fat\" \u2014 but either way, people's descriptors are theirs to decide. You're not always going to be perfect with this stuff; nobody is. But offer other people the respect that you'd like to receive, make an earnest attempt to educate yourself and learn from your mistakes, and you'll be fine. That's all anyone can ask of you.

Key for yourself, but not only for yourself. Body positivity is about working toward a world where everyone can live in their bodies as they please while receiving the same respect, representation, and opportunities as everyone else. So explore why you feel the way you do about your body, decide based on those factors what the correct decisions are for you, and be kind and empathetic toward \u2014 and consistent in your defense of \u2014 other bodies, and you're off to a good start.

Hodge was employed by a nonprofit called Conard House, which runs several cooperatives for adults with mental illnesses throughout the city. As Hodge climbed the stairs to the bedrooms on the second floor, one resident in particular was on his mind. Teresa Sheehan was 56, Japanese-American, and about 250 pounds. She had been with Conard House for over three years. Her diagnosis was schizoaffective disorder, which combines the swings of mania or depression with schizophrenia's psychosis. Hodge had heard from other residents that Teresa had stopped attending house meetings, eating, and changing her clothes. She had also not been taking her medications for some time, potentially for as long as a year and a half. According to her family, she had long disputed that she had a mental illness. Teresa's room was at the end of a hallway. When Hodge knocked on her door she didn't answer. With a property manager's help, he unlocked it. The room was small and cluttered. It had a window at the far end. Teresa was lying on her twin bed with a book over her face. Startled, rising, Teresa told them to get out of her room. She shouted that they had no right to be there and that she had a knife. Hodge later testified he didn't see a knife at that time. He also testified that she threatened to kill him; the property manager didn't hear this. In California, as in much of this country, treating people with psychiatric disabilities without their consent is hard to do. As a social worker, Hodge had a card authorizing him to place someone like Teresa on an involuntary psychiatric hold (which is known colloquially as a \"5150,\" referring to the California statute number). But he can only do so under a few, extreme circumstances: if an individual is gravely disabled or a danger to him or herself, or to others \u2014 like if she threatened to kill someone. Otherwise, even if he believed Teresa Sheehan needed psychiatric care, Heath Hodge couldn't force her to receive it. Because of laws protecting patient privacy, he also couldn't have told a trusted family member or other caregiver what was going on. Teresa's older sister Patricia lives about 15 minutes away from that house. Hodge went to his car to retrieve a pink 5150 form and called the San Francisco Police Department's nonemergency line. He walked down the block to buy a bottle of water and, surprised at how quickly the first officer arrived, jogged to meet her in front of the house. Kathrine Holder had been with the force for seven years. When Hodge explained the situation, she said she wasn't too familiar with 5150s and called a superior. Sgt. Kimberly Reynolds, a veteran of 17 years, soon joined them. Hodge briefed her as well and the three entered the house. The officers knocked on Teresa's door, identified themselves as police, and entered her room. According to the officers, Teresa leapt from her bed. (Teresa later said she opened the door herself.) She screamed that they had no right, that they had no search warrant, and that she had a knife. She grabbed it: It was serrated, with a six-inch fixed blade. Her family say she used to cut fruit in her room because she didn't like using the communal kitchen. Teresa later said she'd eaten that morning. She managed to get the door closed. Holder radioed for backup. Teresa later explained her actions in a deposition: \"I didn't want to be detained and hospitalized on the fact that I wasn't in my right mind. Because I was. I was functioning [in] life well enough, and I didn't want them disturbing me and hospitaliz[ing] me at a cost to the taxpayers and cost to myself.\" Reynolds thrust her torso against Teresa's door, attempting to break it down, and ordered Holder to take out her pepper spray. She was unable to get the door down, so Holder, who was larger, volunteered to do it, and Reynolds held the pepper spray instead. They heard sirens. Reynolds then told Hodge to go downstairs to let the backup officers in. When the door finally broke in, they found Teresa still standing, still screaming threats, still holding the knife. Reynolds pepper-sprayed her but it didn't do anything, perhaps because of Teresa's thick glasses. Then, because she felt cornered and feared for her life, Holder discharged her firearm, \"two or three times.\" She aimed at Teresa's torso. When asked how much time had passed between the door opening and her first shot, Officer Holder later said, \"I would be shocked if it was over five seconds.\" Still, Teresa did not drop her knife, and Reynolds fired her gun several times as well: first at Teresa's torso, and finally a shot into her temple. Reynolds recalled Teresa was still standing when she shot her in the head; Holder said Teresa had fallen on the ground. Teresa's eventual civil suit against the officers calls this final shot an \"attempted execution.\" Teresa was transported to the emergency room. There were 14 bullet holes in her body. She had to have two hip surgeries. Her family say they didn't know anything about the extent of her injuries until they finally saw her the next day. They just remember a doctor telling them that each of those bullets should have killed her. They remember that he called her survival a miracle. \"Woman Shot After Brandishing Knife,\" read the story two days later in the San Francisco Chronicle. It described the threat against Hodge and said he was a social worker. It mentioned the threats against the officers. It included the word \"knife\" four times. It made no mention of the fact that Teresa Sheehan had a mental illness, or that she was having a psychiatric emergency, or that that was why police had been called. After being held about a week, Teresa Sheehan, who had no prior criminal record, was charged with five felonies: making \"terrorist threats\" against Hodge and two counts apiece of assault with a deadly weapon and assault of officers of the peace. Here is the question, the question that, despite seven years of litigation that have followed, has not been answered: Did the officers do the right thing? Behind a closed door, did Teresa Sheehan pose a threat to herself or others, one that necessitated police interference? Or did the police, knowing that she was in the throes of a psychiatric crisis, and therefore irrational, paranoid, and potentially violent, have an obligation to accommodate that disability \u2014 by standing down, by calling for help, by buying time? It's a question with tremendous stakes. The systematic defunding of America's mental health care infrastructure over the last half century and shifts in law surrounding involuntary treatment have produced an epidemic of people with severe mental illness who are unwilling to receive care and/or unable to access it. They've instead become vulnerable to untold, numerous horrors. They've filled the streets. They've filled emergency rooms. They've filled prisons. And if the prison has become the psychiatric hospital, the police officer has become the psychiatric nurse. This benefits no one involved: not individual officers, nor their departments, nor the taxpayers who pay for their mistakes. And it certainly doesn't benefit the likes of Teresa Sheehan, nor her sister Patricia, who came home to a red light on her answering machine that night. Government agencies do not reliably track the number of Americans killed by police. They do an even worse job of keeping track of what percentage of those have a psychiatric disability. A 2013 estimate by an advocacy group and the National Sheriffs' Association guessed that the figure is at least half. A recent Washington Post report found that of the 462 people who have been shot to death so far this calendar year by police, 124, or about a quarter, were \"in the throes of mental or emotional crisis.\" Looking at California specifically, a BuzzFeed News examination of all people killed by police there in 2014 found that approximately 16% had a confirmed history of mental illness. The large variation in these numbers may be due to differences in methodologies, as well as data being extremely difficult to obtain. In addition to no or poor department tracking and patient privacy laws standing in the way is the fact that people with severe mental illness often have compounding problems like drug addiction, poverty, and poor physical health. Many have also often lost all meaningful connections to friends or families. Many of those friends or families may have no interest in discussing these matters for any number of reasons. Regardless of the exact number: It is way too high. Horrific stories about police killing people with mental illness are all too easy to find. When Teresa Sheehan's case reached the Supreme Court this spring, there was no clear consensus among the justices as to what the police officers should have done when faced with that closed door. On a legal technicality, they declined to rule in this matter and kicked the case back down to the lower, district court \u2014 which means the Sheehans' lawsuit against the city and county of San Francisco may finally get a jury trial. But as Justice Sonia Sotomayor said when this case was argued, the question of what should be done about people with mental illnesses as it applies to their interactions with police \u2014 and, one could argue, generally \u2014 is one we can no longer stand to not address. That is, she said, \"Unless we want a society in which the mentally ill are automatically killed.\"\n\n\"I listened to the message and I thought, Is this right?\" Patricia Sheehan, 65, recalls of the night of Aug. 7, 2008. She called back, full of dread. \"The person on the other end said, 'I just want to tell you that your sister has been shot.' I dropped the phone.\"\n\nShe and another of Teresa Sheehan's sisters, Frances, 59, are sitting in Patricia's modest and tidy apartment in one of San Francisco's western neighborhoods on a foggy May day. She has poured us Japanese tea and served coconut cookies in little plastic wrappers, and, Frances has explained, with a slight frustration in her voice, that while we'd all hoped Teresa herself would join us, she had called earlier and said she'd rather be alone today. Most days these days, they say, Teresa would rather be alone. Frances was on a flight up early the next morning; she lived in Orange County at the time, where their mother was in hospice. Their brother John soon joined them. (Their final sister, JoAnn, lives in Virginia and would come later.) The five Sheehan siblings grew up on Okinawa where their father was a civilian officer. He was raised Irish Catholic in New England and met their mother, a Japanese local, after the war. The sisters joke that, had he not met her, he was supposed to go home and become a priest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey recall that the Okinawa of their childhoods was not quite America and not quite Japan. There were wide expanses of lawns between homes. When the siren sounded every day at 5 p.m., you had to stop what you were doing and salute, even if you were driving in your car. \"It was regimented but in a nice way,\" Frances says. (At several points in our conversation they emphasize that they've always respected military and police and have several ties to the uniformed services in their family.) The second oldest, Teresa Sheehan was \"the brains of the family,\" as Patricia puts it. She had a natural scholastic aptitude; she got excellent grades but barely seemed to study. Her former friends and classmates also recall, first, that she was smart; one calls her a \"genius.\" She was in the honors society, did the paper and student government. She was also their family's \"heart,\" Patricia says. \"She's very, very kind to everybody.\" \"She has the patience of a saint,\" Frances nods. \"Saint Teresa.\"\n\nAfter high school graduation, Teresa Sheehan entered Colgate University in upstate New York as a member of the class of 1970. It was the first year that school admitted women, they tell me, with withered pride. Teresa flew across the planet, away from life on Okinawa, and her family, to study religion and philosophy. It was during the next few years that something happened to Teresa's brain, something changed. It's impossible now to know whether anything triggered it; her sisters say Teresa has never spoken to them about what, if anything, happened at school. The age of onset of severe mental illnesses like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder can make them particularly difficult to identify and treat. Whereas other brain disorders present early on in a person's development (autism) or late (dementia), these disorders tend to strike in the late teens and early twenties. This is often right as a young person has become legally independent, left their support system, and entered something new and stressful, like the workforce \u2014 or a newly integrated university 7,500 miles from home.\n\nThe early 1970s were also a particularly inauspicious moment in American history for someone like Teresa Sheehan to start presenting with symptoms of mental illness. As psychiatric researcher and advocate Dr. E. Fuller Torrey outlines in his history of the last century in American mental health care, American Psychosis: For hundreds of years, state psychiatric hospitals provided asylum for those with mental illnesses; many of them were in desperate need of reform. President Kennedy, whose sister Rosemary likely had a mental illness before she was clandestinely lobotomized, believed in this cause but fell sway to a school of thought that mental illnesses were a social, rather than a medical, problem. To fix them, the thinking went, America needed community mental health centers that would prevent such illnesses.\n\nFederal dollars to state-sponsored mental health care trickled to a halt in order to encourage the ascent of these centers, which, it turns out, were based on junk science. In coming years, conservative leaders like Richard Nixon, many of whom weren't fans of psychiatry in general, let Kennedy's ineffectual program lapse. The prejudices against state mental health care spending remained. America began eliminating hundreds of thousands of psychiatric beds, and soon began shuttering state hospitals. As the country's population rose, so did its population of people with mental illnesses, bolstered by veterans returning home from conflicts overseas. States were happy to no longer pay for their treatment, but no one else filled this role \u2014 and no one took the blame for this, either. As Torrey writes: \"The mental illness treatment system had been essentially beheaded.\" He argues that it wasn't deinstitutionalization itself that was the mistake. \"The mistake, rather, was our failure to provide continuing treatment and rehabilitation for these individuals once they left the hospitals.\" California was at the bleeding edge of these changes. It had already closed more than half of its state mental hospitals by the time Ronald Reagan assumed the governorship in 1967; he took care of much of the rest. (As many have noted, it is ironic that the man who later attempted to assassinate him while he was president, John Hinckley, had severe, untreated mental illness.) In this era, too, a series of decisions to do with civil liberties made it much harder to involuntarily commit and hold people with mental illnesses; the first of these was passed in California, also in 1967. The Golden State soon became the first to witness increased rates of homelessness associated with deinstitutionalization, increased rates of incarcerated mentally ill, and increased instances of \u2014 sometimes very publicized \u2014 violence committed by people with mental illnesses who were not receiving treatment. Other states followed. By the 1980s and 1990s, the number of individuals with serious mental illnesses \"who did reasonably well,\" as Torrey summarizes, \"was a minority.\" People with severe mental illnesses have life expectancies that are about a decade or two shorter than that of the general population. Still, no governmental agency \u2014 local, state, or federal \u2014 is taking real responsibility for the care of individuals with severe mental illness. As has been the case for the Sheehans, caring for them has fallen on their families instead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne summer while she was in college, Teresa Sheehan went to stay with her older sister rather than go home to Okinawa. By then Patricia was living in Brookline, Massachusetts, in a small apartment with two roommates. Teresa didn't mention she was having trouble in school other than the fact that she wasn't sleeping. \"She said she couldn't sleep for days,\" Patricia recalls, which was weird because as a teenager Teresa had been a \"slug.\" By midsummer, the roommates were fed up and, at Patricia's request, their father told Teresa to come home. She never returned to Colgate.\n\nFrances, who was still in high school, remembers coming home one night and finding Teresa in the kitchen. \"She kept saying that she saw somebody present with us, but there was nobody,\" she says. She reassured Teresa that she wasn't crazy and said not to worry. Though Frances recalls Teresa did go to a Japanese hospital a time or two, if their parents knew more about what was going on with their sister, they mostly didn't tell the kids. \"We didn't know about mental illness or anything.\" After their father's retirement, Teresa moved with her parents and little brother to the Sacramento area. Still, Teresa's illness wasn't really discussed. Their father was in charge of such things. \"He didn't want us to worry about it. Nothing negative ever,\" Frances says, though the burden of caring for Teresa did weigh on him. \"As much as you can take care of Teresa,\" Patricia says. \"She's stubborn,\" Frances adds. \"She is so stubborn,\" Patricia agrees from across the table. \"That is her worst quality. That's the worst trait for somebody with her illness.\" For a while when they were in their twenties, Patricia, Frances, and Teresa lived together in an apartment in Novato, north of San Francisco. Teresa worked as a secretary in the city. But by now what they termed her \"oddities\" were becoming the rule. She'd wear strange things. She'd sleep for days. Or she'd just lie around and read intellectual books, books on physics, books in other languages, what Frances calls \"books I wouldn't think to read.\" At some point Teresa lost her job. At some point her sisters told her she had to move out. At some point Teresa was acting so strange that Patricia called the police. This is probably the first time Teresa was involuntarily committed. Afterward, Patricia says, \"She was angry. She was very angry at me. I didn't visit her. I was angry with her.\" Her sisters say they don't know all the jobs she's had and lost. They don't know all the places she's lived and had to leave. They mention one halfway house, another house owned by a dentist, one staff room at a hotel. They don't know if she's been homeless. Frances would sometimes get a call and have to write a check for several months of rent owed to somebody or another. Patricia would sometimes find Teresa standing outside her job, once with a birthday cake. \"My friends would joke, 'Do we dare eat it?'\" Patricia would sometimes drive around at night looking for her sister. Even if they could, Patricia and Frances say they wouldn't want to know all of the places their sister has lived. They wouldn't want to know all that she has been through. What they do know: Teresa is shy. She is private. She has a great memory \u2014 you go to a restaurant and she'll tell you what you were wearing last time you were there and what you ordered. Patricia is a strong woman, more stoic than Frances, and yet her voice breaks only ever so slightly when she says, \"I just think that if I ever heard some of her stories it would probably kill me.\"\n\nPsychiatric disabilities become harder to treat the longer they are untreated. Experts now agree that early intervention, a swift response to a first episode, and then consistent, supportive care is the best way of preventing a mental illness from effectively ruining a person's life.\n\nWhereas a person can survive without treatment for a time, they will have occasional episodes during which things become especially bad, in which case they will require hospitalization until they are stable. But Teresa didn't believe she had an illness, and still does not. This is a not uncommon symptom of severe mental illness. As a family, the Sheehans' options in terms of helping her were \u2014 and remain \u2014 few. Teresa Sheehan's family guess that the longest she's ever been in a psychiatric facility is about three weeks. For the most part, her involuntary psychiatric stays have been within the 72-hour period typically allowed by California law. This is often weeks before a psychiatric medication has had a chance to take effect \u2014 let alone for a physician to assess whether it is the correct medicine or dosage; these medications often are accompanied by debilitating side effects.\n\nThe Sheehans could have forced Teresa to receive longer-term care only if she had committed a felony and been confined to a psychiatric hospital after having pleaded insanity. They didn't have the money to pay for a private facility, which can run thousands of dollars a week. Instead, Teresa Sheehan's mental health care has been a patchwork of emergency rooms and outpatient programs. She has seen countless nurses, countless doctors. She's been prescribed, and stopped taking, countless medications. She is not wrong, in other words, to be skeptical of mental health care. Frances remembers they were once at a hospital together and some new psychiatrist wanted to talk and Teresa said, \"Why should I talk to this person? They're just going to be there a short while. Then I'll have to start all over again.\" Even when she'd get in a relatively stable situation, like the cooperative sponsored by Conard House, Teresa didn't receive proper care, the sisters say. How, they ask, did they let her go a year and a half without taking medication? (In an email, a representative of Conard House cited privacy law in denying all interview requests for this story. He wouldn't say whether Heath Hodge still worked for them. Attempts to contact Hodge otherwise weren't responded to.) When their father died in 1988, Teresa read a eulogy at his funeral. Patricia hands me a copy of it, saying that the priest had asked them afterward whether Teresa was a professional writer. It is poignant and stunningly well-written. \"He was a man of attitude,\" Teresa wrote. \"It never did to just wake up each morning. He roused us with the exhortation to 'Rise and Shine.'\" I ask how Teresa's illness affected their mother \u2014 that her daughter, one who'd shown so much potential, was so lost. \"She was devastated,\" Patricia answers. \"She used to always say to me, 'If something happens to me and I don't know who you are, just put me in a nursing home, because I won't care. But take care of your sister.'\" From across the table, Frances repeats the mantra: \"At the end of the day, take care of Teresa.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen it became clear that Teresa was going to survive the shooting, the Sheehan siblings made the decision to not tell their dying mother what was happening. Frances would instead tell their mom she had business trips when she made frequent trips up to San Francisco. (Their mother in turn told Patricia she suspected Frances was lying to her.)\n\nTeresa was shackled to the hospital bed and an officer stood by. Her family wasn't allowed to touch her, let alone hug or kiss her. They weren't allowed to talk to her for more than a few minutes on the phone. They say she was not formally charged for a week and was then assigned a public defender who would represent her in the impending criminal litigation. Patricia's home became the de facto base of operation in the ensuing months. They survived, she says, by \"cooking and drinking.\" Meanwhile Frances, the more business-minded of the two, dove into advocating for her sister. She had Teresa sign a form making her Teresa's attorney-in-fact, which allowed her to gain access to Teresa's medical records. She was on the phone and emailing \u2014 the hospital, the police, city hall. \"All I know is I start from the top and I work my way down,\" she says. There was no time to be sad. \"My sister's life is on the line.\" After a few weeks, Teresa was transferred in the night to the San Francisco County Jail. Teresa's metal jail bed was low, not compliant with the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA), her sisters say, and though she told guards she was in pain, her complaints weren't taken seriously. She finally collapsed while one of her attorneys happened to be present; they later learned that the metal rod had broken away from the screw in her fractured femur. It had to be reoperated upon.\n\nMost worrisome, though, were her wounds, which needed to be cleaned daily. \"Our concern was they were throwing her in there so she could get an infection and die,\" Frances explains. Frances called a meeting with jail and hospital officials and set a stack of files of people she said had died of infections in jail on the table. \"I said, 'Each one of the cases that I have, they died in the county jail. I'm just going to let you know right now, if anything happens to Teresa, I'm going to hold you legally, personally, professionally responsible for her death.'\" The Sheehans say Teresa was transported back to the hospital soon after. Their mother died on Halloween. Patricia asked the guards for extra time with Teresa that day, and they gave it to her. Several times the sisters emphasize that not everybody they've interacted with throughout this ordeal was bad; in fact many people were really helpful, really generous. That day, she says, the guard even let her give her sister a hug.\n\n\"It was a really emotional trial for me,\" Teresa's public defender Kleigh Hathaway remembers, though her involvement with Teresa's story ended six years ago. Even during jury selection, after they'd excused the dozens who weren't picked, she sent a couple of paralegals out into the hall, as she often does, to gauge how they felt. People were apparently irate, asking whom they could write to say to drop the charges: \"They were calling my client 'the victim,'\" she says. \"They were asking, 'Don't the police get more training?'\"\n\nShe rushed to prepare for their trial, which was set to begin in mid-November, jumping through hoops to try to get police training records. Then there was the matter of her defendant. \"She'd completely decompensated,\" Hathaway says. \"She was really, really paranoid and scared because of her mental illness prior to this incident, and this incident fulfilled any paranoia she would have had.\" She recalls it took weeks before Teresa would talk to her. She made it one of her paralegals' job just to help get Teresa dressed each day before court. \"I did the trial holding my breath and hoping she wasn't going to say something that was completely crazy.\" Frances bought a full-figured dummy and adhesive dots \u2014 she used to teach day care, she explains \u2014 and they had an expert mark on her body where the bullets entered and exited. They managed to get photos they'd clandestinely taken of Teresa's wounds included as well. They called an expert in police mental health training. Through the trial, the Sheehans remember, advocates from the San Francisco chapter of the National Alliance of Mental Illness sat in the courtroom, as did a reporter from the local now-defunct Japanese-American paper. The trial lasted several weeks and the jury deliberated for one. Teresa was found not guilty of making terrorist threats against Heath Hodge, and the jury was hung on the other four counts. The Chronicle reported that it was 11\u20131 on the assault charges against the officers and 7\u20135 on the weapons ones. It quoted one juror as saying that she hoped the prosecutors wouldn't retry the case: \"This woman has had enough.\" After the criminal part was over, Frances remembers, \"I went home and I slept for three days. I cried and I cried.\" She hadn't had time to mourn their mother, she explains. Or Teresa. \"I'd never really cried for my sister Teresa. I was too busy.\" In January 2009, the district attorney's office announced it was not going to try the criminal case against Teresa Sheehan again. That August, a year after the shooting, the Sheehans filed their civil case against both the city and county of San Francisco and Sgt. Reynolds and Officer Holder individually. They were represented by the firm of John Burris, known for defending civil rights violations. One of the bases for their suit was that the officers had violated the ADA when they busted down Teresa's door a second time. \"With the door closed, what threat was she to you?\" one of her attorneys, Ben Nisenbaum, asks. Teresa was obviously disinterested in interacting with the police. By opening the door, they more or less guaranteed the situation would escalate. \"What consideration did you give to Ms. Sheehan's mental state? You knew she was schizophrenic, you knew she was off her medication, you knew she had grabbed a knife,\" he says. When they opened the door a second time, \"Why would you think she would act normally?\"\n\nPut your weapon away. Lower your voice. Don't expect the person in psychiatric crisis to react rationally or nonviolently. Secure the scene but wait for backup before moving in. Seek the assistance of mental health professionals. Most importantly: Buy yourself time. De-escalation tactics, often called the Memphis Model or Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) training, are lauded by experts as being the best practices police can employ in these situations. They also run contrary to much of what police academies teach about using control \u2014 and potentially lethal force \u2014 to take control of individuals in fast-moving, uncertain situations.\n\nSince it pioneered this program in 1988, following the fatal shooting of a mentally ill man, the city of Memphis has experienced a dramatic reduction in deaths of this kind. Some other departments across the country have adopted it, but many would argue not enough. The Washington Post's recent analysis of those Americans with psychiatric disabilities who've been killed so far this year by police found that \"More than half the killings involved police agencies that have not provided their officers with state-of-the-art training to deal with the mentally ill.\" The Memphis Model was not standard in the San Francisco Police Department in 2008. A 2013 KQED investigation showed that of those shot by San Francisco police between 2005 and 2013, 14 of 51, over a quarter, had a confirmed mental illness. When they were deposed, both Officer Holder and Sgt. Reynolds did not have strong or specific recollections as to what sort of training, if any, they had received with regard to how to interact with people who were experiencing a psychiatric crisis. They did explain their logic that morning. They said they didn't know whether Teresa could have escaped the room via a fire escape and been a threat to the public. There could have been someone else in the room. She could have harmed herself. She could have had another weapon or she could have stabbed them through the door. (Requests to interview Officer Holder or any other officers affiliated with the case were denied by the SFPD. Sgt. Reynolds, who did not respond to interview requests, has since retired from the force and appears to have become a real estate agent.) After the Sheehans filed their civil suit, the San Francisco city attorney's office made no moves to settle with them. Instead, in June 2010, it filed to have their lawsuit thrown out. The district judge who ruled in the matter was the Honorable Charles R. Breyer, brother of Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer (who would later recuse himself when this case reached that court). At a hearing in April 2011, Judge Breyer appeared to be incredulous at the idea that the police should have waited for backup to come rather than break down Teresa's door, repeatedly calling Teresa \"deranged.\" \"Well, they should have had an analysis as to whether she was suicidal?\" he asked Ben Nisenbaum. \"Like, 'Let's have a \u2014 let's give her some therapy to see whether she has thoughts of suicide'? She has a butcher knife, and she's screaming. And she's not coming out, and not taking care of herself.\" Both sisters remember that day well. \"It dehumanized her, the words he used,\" Frances says. \"I had to run out,\" Patricia explains. Breyer threw out the Sheehans' suit. Two months later, they appealed. In February 2014, the liberal 9th Circuit Court overturned Breyer's ruling in part, holding that police had an obligation to accommodate Teresa Sheehan's psychiatric disability. \"This case involves a near fatal tragedy in which police officers attempted to help a mentally ill woman who needed medical evaluation and treatment but wound up shooting and nearly killing her instead,\" Judge Raymond C. Fisher began his opinion. \"Fundamentally at issue is the constitutional balance between a person\u2019s right to be left alone in the sanctity of her home and the laudable efforts of the police to render emergency assistance, but in a way that does not turn the intended beneficiary into a victim or a criminal.\" Again, rather than settling with the Sheehans, or letting the case go to trial, the San Francisco city attorney's office continued to fight to have it thrown out. In May 2014, they filed to have it heard by the U.S. Supreme Court. The court agreed to hear the case in November of last year. Imagine the amount of money the city and county of San Francisco have spent to date on Teresa Sheehan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Jan. 16, 2015, a group of activists were participating in a #BlackLivesMatter \"die-in\" near San Francisco's City Hall. Afterward, they joined a coalition of disability rights advocates and together marched inside to ask City Attorney Dennis Herrera for a meeting. They wanted his office to drop its petition to have the Sheehan case heard by the Supreme Court. If the court ruled in San Francisco's favor that the ADA did not apply to the arrest of Americans with psychiatric disabilities, this could potentially affect millions of Americans \u2014 and potentially Americans with other kinds of disabilities as well.\n\n\n\nThe group was told he had no time to meet with them and was asked to leave. They then sang protest songs. One of them, activist Bryndis Tobin, sings me the words of one song into the phone. Tobin tells me she is from a long line of activists, grew up mixed race in a majority-white school, and is now an attorney. She read the city attorney's petition to the Supreme Court and was appalled. For Bryndis, this was personal: \"My husband is [legally] blind,\" she explains. \"And if he can't see what you're pointing at, the city's argument is if that officer felt a threat, regardless of anything else, then it was OK for him to shoot my husband, without ever giving him a chance to comply. It's totally OK for the officer to kill my husband and I can't even sue him afterwards.\" Tobin argues these issues \u2014 needless violence at the hands of police toward people of color, and people with disabilities, psychiatric and otherwise \u2014 overlap. \"The thing is in the African-American community, in the Latino community, in all the communities of color, nobody is confused about how incredibly dangerous it is to be disabled in this country. Nobody is confused by that at all,\" Tobin says. The group got its meeting, which was held on Jan. 29. Among those afforded time to speak was Vinny Eng. Eng, like most of the people I spoke to, never expected to become an advocate for the mentally ill. His family had fled the Khmer Rouge, he tells me in a voice so sweet it is disarming, and his sister Jazmyne grew up to have post-traumatic stress disorder and schizophrenia. She'd long been stable when, three years ago, she suffered a psychiatric emergency in the Southern California clinic she'd attended for 10 years. Staff there called a nonemergency line at the sheriff's department. \"Within eight minutes of the call my sister was shot twice by a deputy and killed at the clinic,\" says Eng. \"This was within less than 15 seconds of visual contact.\" You can tell he's told this horrible story many, many times. \"The Sheehan case happened so long ago,\" Eng recalls imploring at that meeting with the city attorney. \"The community dynamic is so different today than when the Sheehan case happened. Why are we arguing for the status quo when we have been advocating for so many years to bring progress, to ensure that someone who's having a psychotic episode and interacting with law enforcement has a safe, nonlethal outcome?\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause, as people on all sides of this issue in San Francisco agree, things have been changing for the better. Following the Sheehan incident and a few others, the department sent representatives of Memphis to do ride-alongs. Then, in 2012, it implemented a 40-hour CIT training program on a volunteer basis. Lt. Mario Molina says that today more than 300 officers \u2014 over 20% of the patrol force \u2014 and also some Bay Area Rapid Transit police have been trained in CIT. He says they're only going to continue and that the goal is to train the entire SFPD.\n\n\"Most police officer\u2013involved shootings happen within 90 seconds to two minutes of arrival of officers at the scene,\" Lt. Molina, who was a psychology major and then counselor before joining the force in 1995, explains. \"Our officers need to slow down. Create that distance, create that time, that might help to resolve the situation without using force.\" Vinny Eng is a part of the group that has helped institute this program and monitor it, along with representatives of the department, mental health professionals, and public health officials.\n\nThey also helped organize a first: On May 12 of this year, they held an awards ceremony for officers whose use of de-escalation techniques proved especially heroic. Nine officers were given awards, including one who spent hours literally talking a veteran with PTSD off a ledge. All the brass were there. It was, by all accounts, deeply moving. That, Lt. Molina explains, is how you do the near-impossible: change a department's culture.\n\nVinny Eng cautions against \"scapegoating\" police. He and every advocate and expert I spoke with, in San Francisco and nationally, acknowledge that the mental health care infrastructure, or lack thereof, is ultimately to blame for the present policing crisis. One in four American adults experience mental illness. A lot of us know somebody, or have somebody in our family, who is estranged, who was put away, who hasn't been heard from in some time. Or who is dead. It's been demonstrated that there is a genetic component to the instance of these disorders, though, generally speaking, they are only starting to be understood, and more research is needed. The fact remains that severe mental illnesses are affecting American families of all backgrounds, races, and means. They are affecting some whose families are not at all equipped to handle them, and others who are patient or stubborn enough to at least try. I ask Eng what is the biggest thing he'd like people in families that aren't affected by mental illness to know. He doesn't seem to think before he answers: \"The most dangerous thing that anyone in the public can do is remain indifferent about this.\"\n\nTeresa is now 63. Since 2009, Teresa Sheehan has lived in a single-room-occupancy hotel in the Tenderloin, a pocket of San Francisco where the sidewalks are lined with the shopping carts and plastic bags and the sounds and smells of people who are drug-addicted, mentally ill, and homeless \u2014 and often combinations thereof. Her sisters don't want her to be there but say they have no other choice; no other available facility could accommodate Teresa's physical disabilities that resulted from the shooting. They say she doesn't do a good job of taking care of herself. Her jaw was affected by the shot to her temple, but she hates the dentist. They together momentarily lament the declining state of her teeth.\n\nThey don't know whether she's receiving any psychiatric care or taking medication, but from what they've been able to tell, she's not. Patricia says the two of them drove up to visit their mother's grave earlier this year and Teresa talked nonstop the entire time. As far as they know, she's gotten no counseling for the trauma of having been shot. They know that something that has affected her in particular is her allegation that she was not properly covered when she was loaded into an ambulance that day. She's become much more withdrawn since the shooting, they say. More childlike. They repeat several times I shouldn't be offended that she didn't join us tonight. They tell me I can write her a letter if I like, and I do. I haven't heard back yet. They say they mostly keep Teresa in the dark about the particulars of the litigation; they don't want to worry her or get her hopes up. Oral arguments before the Supreme Court took place on March 23, 2015. A Seattle attorney named Leonard Feldman had heard about the Sheehan case after the 9th Circuit's decision and argued on the Sheehans' behalf pro bono. (\"I've always been passionate about abuse of power issues,\" he tells me. \"It seems to be most profound when you're looking at police officers and prison guards.\") Frances and JoAnn were there. Afterward, Frances says, a law student who'd heard about the case came up to her and gave her a hug.\n\nThe next day, Teresa called Patricia and said, \"'Guess what? I'm on the front page of the San Francisco Chronicle!'\" Patricia recalls, laughing. Teresa bought two copies and had Patricia hold on to one, explaining she tends to lose things in her room.\n\nThe decision came down on Monday, May 18, 2015. The court punted, mostly. On the only interesting matter from the standpoint of legal experts following this case \u2014 the ADA's application during arrests \u2014 six justices joined in saying they could not rule, and sent the case to be tried by Judge Breyer's District Court. The Supreme Court did rule in a second matter, holding that the officers couldn't be sued as individuals by the Sheehans, a ruling that those following the case weren't surprised by (the liability standard that protects individual officers of the law is very high). \"S.F. Police Shielded in Ruling by High Court\" was the San Francisco Chronicle's headline on May 19, a way of phrasing the news that confused even advocates close to the case, who incorrectly believed that the Sheehans had lost their civil suit. In fact, nearly seven years on, they have finally won the right to have it tried. Frances Sheehan sounds exhausted on the phone the day after the ruling comes down. \"I'm pleased that we are able to go to trial,\" she says. \"Teresa's case will be heard in San Francisco. A jury trial.\" The second bit of good news from the perspective of the Sheehans: As a result of the Supreme Court not ruling in that first matter, the 9th Circuit's ruling \u2014 that the ADA does apply to arrests of individuals with psychiatric disabilities \u2014 holds. \"Teresa made case law,\" Frances says. That same afternoon, I ask the deputy city attorney who'd argued the case before the court, Christine Van Aken, whether they plan to settle with the Sheehans. \"I don't know the answer to that,\" she said. \"We do feel very strongly that the officers didn't violate the ADA here.\"\n\nOn the morning of June 10, 2015, a few weeks after the Supreme Court's ruling in the Sheehan case, a congressman named Tim Murphy took the house floor. The Republican from Pennsylvania is the only practicing psychologist holding elected federal office. He wore a green tie and spoke as fast as he seemingly could as he outlined the nation's mental health care crisis:\n\n\"Over the last 30 years, we've shut down the old asylums and what we've seen is increase in incarceration, suicide, homelessness, emergency room visits, unemployment, substance abuse and substance abuse deaths. We have failed on all these metrics. Anyone \u2014 anyone \u2014 who thinks we are being successful in helping those with severe mental illness is delusional.\" Murphy rattled off statistics: 10 million Americans have severe mental illness (of those, 1.3 million aren't receiving treatment). 1.3 million Americans attempt suicide each year. 40,000 succeed. We have a shortage of 100,000 psychiatric hospital beds. \"This is what the American taxpayer buys for $130 billion a year?\" he nearly shouted. The bill he was reintroducing, the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act (which previously failed in 2014), proposes to fix what he calls our \"mess\" of a federal health care system. It has bipartisan support, including that of Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson, a Democrat from Texas who is a former psychiatric nurse. Another of the bill's advocates is Virginia state Sen. Creigh Deeds, also a Democrat. After his son Gus was diagnosed as bipolar at the age of 21, Sen. Deeds was unable to do anything but stand by as Gus refused treatment and deteriorated. In November 2013, when he was 24, Gus stabbed his father multiple times, and then committed suicide at their home. Soon after the speech, Congressman Murphy talks with me about how his bill would address this public health crisis, which he says is no different than any other. \"Serious mental illness is a brain illness and we have to stop acting as if you have to suck it up and it goes away. That is a myth.\" He reminds me that there was a time when you couldn't talk about cancer because of stigma; now we have huge marches, football players wearing pink shoes.\n\nCongressman Murphy's bill would also relax privacy laws, giving families more access to information about a severely mentally ill person's otherwise confidential health care information. Murphy emphasizes this would be only in certain cases where individuals have demonstrated a repeated inability to care for themselves, and even then, only some information would be allowable: the name of a doctor, a diagnosis, the name of medications prescribed, the time and date of next appointment. \"In other words, we give enough information to the caregiver, the responsible caregiver, so that they can facilitate that person's care.\" Advocates for the rights of people with mental illnesses oppose such measures. When asked specifically about what Congressman Murphy's bill proposes, a representative for the group Disability Rights California said in an email: \"We believe it is discriminatory and violates civil rights.\" When I ask about the odds that his bill passes the House and goes to the Senate \u2014 and eventually becomes law \u2014 Congressman Murphy says he doesn't like to think about odds. He says he's got the photos of the kids who were massacred at Sandy Hook on his desk. He says we can't go on not dealing with this. \"What has happened over the years, I've experienced myself, thousands and thousands of families are driven into silence. They hide these issues. They don't want to talk about them.\" Call your congressman, he says; write that email. \"I think we have a very good shot if Americans speak up.\" Patricia Sheehan says they're speaking up because they hope Teresa's story can serve as a wake-up call. \"I think everything has been for a bigger reason. The community \u2014 everywhere in this country \u2014 we need to help people like her.\"\n\nThe apartment has begun to smell of roasting chicken. Every time Patricia crosses between the dining room and the kitchen she jostles a curtain of wooden beads. She pours wine. Frances tells me she's read about injectable psychiatric medications, which could help take the question of taking a pill every day out of her sister's hands.\n\nSoon, caramelized carrots and onions bathed in chicken fat will be scooped onto plates alongside a salad with avocado and Bibb lettuce, and big hunks of sourdough. Across town, Teresa is alone in her room. There isn't yet a date set for their long-awaited second trial. They also don't like discussing odds. But if they do get any money from the city and county of San Francisco, the Sheehans say they'd like to be able to get Teresa out of that Tenderloin SRO. They want to get her set up in a good, private facility \u2014 somewhere stable, somewhere with care and activities to keep her stimulated and, most importantly, medicated.\n\nNot that they talk to Teresa about money or what they'd do with it. They don't want to get her hopes up. \"The thing is there are times when it takes everything I have just to even see her,\" Patricia says. \"Last time she was here,\" she goes on, \"she said to me something about having lived there six years. She said, 'I don't think I'll ever get out of this place.'\" Finally, after the hours we've been talking, her voice and composure finally break: \"It broke my heart.\" Frances nods. \"Our lives still go on and we can do so many other things, but she sits there day in, day out, day in, day out.\"\n\nMeral Agish, with assistance from Jeremy Singer-Vine, performed the analysis of police shootings in California for this story.\n\n\n\nWant to read more stories like this?

Again. \"Why do we keep having this argument? Why did I keep asking you to do things, and you agree to do them, and then you just...don't do them?\" I said, like I had said so many times before. He apologized, like he had so many times before. And then he said, so sadly, \"It's just...getting through my day is so overwhelming, I just don't have the energy to do anything else.\" There was something about the way he said it that left me feeling like I'd stepped into a commercial for antidepressants. \"Oh,\" I said. \"I think I know what's going on.\" But despite the many therapy sessions and doctors and prescriptions and really good days since that lightbulb moment, there are still a lot of days when I feel like I don't know what's going on. The ways in which mental illness can affect intimate relationships often go against the cultural narrative about what a \"good\" or \"happy\" marriage looks like. We're told that a \"good\" husband or wife is thoughtful, attentive, generous, social, and sexual. And if a partner isn't one of those things, it's because one of you isn't good enough, or doesn't love the other enough. We're always told that love conquers all. But sometimes antidepressants help, too.\n\nWhether you're the one with the diagnosis or your partner is, living with mental illness is hard. For the one with mental illness, there is the illness itself, plus a whole host of other feelings: the vulnerability that comes with letting someone truly see you as you are, the anger when they don't get it, the guilt when they reassure you, the shame that you aren't easily \"fixed,\" the fear that one day they'll give up on you. For the partner, there's the confusion over what's causing your partner to act in ways that often defy reason, the worry that they'll hurt themselves, the disappointment when they break promises, the guilt when you remember it's not their fault, the shame that tells you it's your fault, the fear that one day they'll give up on you. But thousands of couples don't give up. After I put out a call for stories about mental illness in relationships, I received about 175 emails from people who were willing to share their story. All but three were stories of hope, love, and support. People were incredibly honest about some of the worst days of their lives. Mostly, they wanted everyone else going through it to know they aren't alone. Below are stories from four of the couples who reached out: Matt and Justin (ADHD) Jordan and Justin (Bipolar disorder and painkiller addiction) Khakan and T (OCD and bulimia) Nancy and Dan (Bipolar disorder and postpartum depression) Share On email Share On email\n\nShare On link Share On link Share This Link\n\nShare On facebook Share On facebook Share\n\nMatt, 29, and Justin, 29; Rockville Centre, New York Justin has ADHD. Justin: I did not receive an official ADHD diagnosis until the summer after my first year in undergrad. Looking back, I charmed my way through high school with an outgoing, kind, and energetic personality in addition to a pretty great smile. When I got to college, things were very, very different. There, I was suddenly responsible for my own organization and motivation. Things fell apart, and that initiated my decision to talk to someone. I met with a psychologist who asked if I had ever considered that I have ADHD. Looking back, all the pieces fit together. I then went for a full psychological evaluation, and the results screamed ADHD. Matt: We have been together for over nine years \u2014 first as college roommates, but of course we didn't date for two years (imagine the drama?!). It wasn't until we moved out of the dorms that we connected. We continued to date through college and his long-term grad school (getting his doctorate in school psychology) in upstate New York. Justin is my world. My everything. He's my rock. At first, as a roommate, Justin was just a friend with ADHD. And a friend with ADHD is nothing but a good time. Up for anything, always on the go, and more than happy to give you some pretty memorable college memories. As a boyfriend, ADHD means so much more. Broken conversations. Forgotten anniversaries. Waiting for a ride. Misunderstanding. Mood swings. It can mean sitting in utter and complete silence on date night, or it could mean watching your partner spiral into overnight manic study sessions to barely finish a paper. Justin: Living with ADHD can be difficult. I tend to either act without thinking, or not act because of overthinking. It is difficult to follow conversations I'm involved with. Matt: It also means unbridled joy. Childlike fun. Getting lost in the moment. And even, at times, understanding that you are the complete and total center of someone's attention. At first, you may never really know which person you're talking with \u2014 or what you said to make them even more upset. But in time, we learned how we each worked. One night, sitting in bed, Justin explained to me just what goes on in his head on a daily basis. \"You know that little voice you hear when you read to yourself?\" he said. \"Well, I don't have one.\" That was a breakthrough. Justin went on how to explain how sometimes we can chat or reason with our inner selves. But his brain simply does not work like that. For him, things aren't necessarily thought about; they are decided in the moment. Meeting new people, remembering names, or following conversation is like mental gymnastics \u2014 sometimes he can stick his landing, other times he may fall. What does a good day look like? Matt: I think a good day is us just spending some time together. Firing on all the same cylinders. Sleeping in, but not too in (leave it to Justin and he would be in bed till 4 p.m. every day). A movie and a dinner date. I like to think we are like big kids (he definitely helps with that), so hitting up a toy store or going laser-tagging is always a good time. Justin: Good days are us being on the same page. Laughing, chilling on the couch, remembering to follow through with things, having a quality conversation. A really good day is me being on time.

Matt: A bad day would be a mood shift. If I feel frustrated because I feel like he's not chatting or too scattered to focus, I shut down. Then, just when I am getting out of a funk, his mood dips. Those are the worst days. Justin: Not following through with things, forgetting things in the apartment when leaving, not remembering to bring up a topic and being completely distracted and unfocused. Matt needing to tell me things three and four times before it registers or sticks. Matt: Our relationship was long-distance for three years. That was our most frustrating and rocky time. Our relationship eventually turned into utter and complete routine; a good morning text, perhaps a midday phone call, an \"I am leaving work text,\" and a forced goodnight phone call. When he was free, I was crashing from a full 10-hour workday. Plus, him trying to juggle school meant that he would forgot to ask about important parts of my day; how grandma is feeling after surgery or how that big interview went. I misinterpreted his lack of communication as not caring. He later told me he would remember about that job interview or big film shoot days later, when something triggered his memory, but he felt it was so many days old it wasn't worth mentioning. We just weren't syncing when we weren't together. A few times I went upstate with the mindset of breaking up, but once we were back together it reminded me of why we were together. Our silliness, friendship, and love were refueled with each of those trips. Justin has told me now he sensed my real purpose for going up there, but did his best to ignore it. That was the hardest period in our relationship, but we got through it. I feel that if we were able to overcome that three-year rough patch, anything is possible. Has his mental illness affected your sex life? Matt: I would say it's definitely \"killed\" the mood sometimes. Who wouldn't want to come home on a Friday after a long week to see your perfect man cooking up some juicy chicken parm in nothing but his skivvies and an apron? (Hey, it's my fantasy.) Instead, Justin is walking around in circles trying to clean the house, with the TV blasting, underwear all over the floor, and no idea what's for dinner. What has helped you two manage ADHD as a couple? Justin: [For people with ADD or ADHD], have patience with [your partner] and with yourself. Don't beat yourself up over the difficulties. It is a part of who you are. Own it and grow. Be as open with your significant other as you can. It will be difficult at times, but it will be your biggest asset in a successful relationship. [For partners], read up. The time you invest in reading about ADHD will pay off. Have patience. Understand that it is difficult for us to communicate what is going on or how we feel because we may not know ourselves. Try not to take things personally. Matt: Nine years in, I definitely know Justin in and out. If I see that he is struggling to find a response or process something mentally, I will just say, \"Think about what you are trying to say, take your time.\" We take a moment, pause, and then speak. From small daily tasks to weekend plans and everything in between, repetition is key. Also, time apart is a must! Sometimes, like any relationship, you are just on two separate wavelengths and need a break. I don't think that really has anything to do with ADHD, but if he or I are having a rough day, it can make it worse. I am not a teacher, I am not a banker, I am not a mother...but it can often be difficult not to take on a piece of these roles in daily life with someone with ADHD. Questions like \"Did you pay your credit card bill? Did you take your medicine? Did you finish your grad paper? Did you do your answers for the nice BuzzFeed lady?\" can come off as accusatory or nagging. Unfortunately, I need to ask those questions to make sure the bills were paid on time! If I am starting to be a pest, Justin just says something or gives a look. He's really good at those looks. Do you have any fears about the future? Matt: Who doesn't? I think my biggest fear is traveling the path of life together with one person, who may get a little distract\u2014 oh, squirrel! But I wouldn't want to take this journey with anyone but Justin. Justin: My biggest fear is that the mental and emotional effort it takes to be with me will get to be too much for Matt. I make valiant efforts, but things don't always pan out the way I hope. I love Matt with all my heart, and deep down truly believe we can overcome any obstacle. What do you love about each other? Matt: Justin is one of the kindest people in the world. Clich\u00e9, I know, but he will literally give you the shirt (usually a sweatshirt) off his back. He's sensitive, and will put others first, all the time. Plus, what made me fall in love with him was his general enthusiasm. His eyes light up even at the simplest of things. He makes you stop and re-evaluate what's really important in life. He just makes you feel loved, unconditionally. Justin: He doesn't give up. Always ready to learn and grow. He accepts me for who I am; sees me as a complete picture. I know he ALWAYS has my back. He is supportive, dedicated, and can be the BIGGEST pain in the ass. I love the look in his eyes when he looks at me. The world stops in the little moments, like meeting eyes from across a crowded room. Matt: We may never be able to sit down and debate the latest breakthroughs in astrophysics, but who cares? That's not us. That's not who we are. We know how we each think, act, and \u2014 more importantly \u2014 love. I could never love another person more that I love Justin. Justin doesn't just have ADHD; we do. Learn more about ADD and ADHD here.\n\nJordan, 29, and Justin, 29; Texas Justin has bipolar disorder and was previously addicted to prescription drugs. Jordan: I have known Justin since we were 13, and he was my first boyfriend ever. We have been on and off for years and years because of normal life junk. He has a daughter from another relationship, and I have two from a previous marriage. He always had \"issues,\" according to his family, and I believe they did right by what they knew. Justin: I was a '90s kid with \"ADD/ADHD.\" So, my mom and dad had me seeing a doctor at the age of 6. From then until I was 17, I have been on every pill they could throw at you for ADD. Jordan: There was never any real improvement, and his family just started to ignore his perceived issues. He came back into my life five years ago, after I got divorced and while he was in the U.S. Navy. We all thought the Navy was going to be a godsend for him: structure, doing something he could be proud of. But he is one of the many that the military was not the greatest idea for, in regards to his emotional and mental health. In my most humble opinion, there is not enough screening for emotional and mental health for our servicemen and -women prior to joining. In 2009, Justin's second year in the Navy, he started to develop anxiety. Justin: I started having very strange thoughts. For example, I would be talking to someone I respect and would have a flashing thought: spit in their face. Of course I would not act on it, but sometimes the thoughts would get to the point that I would be mistaken as disrespectful because I would have to walk away from a conversation. This was the first time I really noticed something was off. Jordan: He, like many, went to his C.O. and to the Navy docs for help, and was put on benzos and painkillers, which are highly addictive. Justin got out of the Navy in 2011. Jordan: Even though it was hard at times, he missed his Navy buddies and that life so much. His self-image and self-worth declined rapidly as he became more anxious and dependent on the medicines prescribed to him. He had what we referred to as an alter ego, named Brett, when he would slip into his \"moods.\" It became clear there was something more going on. We went through the VA, like we were told, to get him help. The VA is the most depressingly unorganized joke of a hospital. They lost his chart and diagnosis multiple times. He was finally diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and on top of that was slowly becoming addicted to the Xanax and hydrocodone that they had him on. Jordan said the couple spent thousands of dollars on non-VA doctors, who all recommended lithium as treatment. The VA doctors wouldn't take the recommendations of the other physicians, but since Justin didn't have insurance, he kept going to the VA doctors, who prescribed several other medications. Justin: I truly believe that today I am still recovering from the effects of the poorly managed health care I received. There were so many nights adjusting to new medicines. I would wake up screaming, if I actually fell asleep at all, due to reactions to the pills. It would make my skin feel like it was crawling, like I had bugs living inside of me. I was having the worst nightmares you could imagine. It was absolutely terrifying to go to sleep. So they put me on sleeping pills. Jordan: It took the VA a year of failures and horrifying experiences to finally try lithium, which is one of the most common treatments for bipolar disorder. He went through so much. He would be so exhausted he couldn't get out of bed, would have emotional outbursts of every kind, would be super-needy all of a sudden and suffocating in the relationship, have insomnia spells, would go completely numb and coldhearted, etc. But through all of this he managed to get two degrees in school. Justin is no longer addicted to pills; Jordan says he got over the addiction relatively quickly with the help of a functional medicine doctor. Justin: I still have a hard time understanding what is my disorder and what is real. I have some of the most wicked depression, to the point it is not fair to a spouse. There are days when I have literally not been able to drag myself out from under the covers because the voice inside of me also likes to tell me how much of a failure I am and he likes to make sure I know when I am having an \"off\" day. While I am being consumed with my own self-loathing, my wonderful loving partner has no idea what is going on and doesn't hear from me for days. I will go without paying my phone bill on purpose because deep down, I do not want anyone to be able to get ahold of me. Jordan, are you able to reassure him when he's feeling guilty or seeing himself as a failure? Jordan: It is really hard to reassure him. Sometimes it's as simple as going on a date. Other times, no matter what I say or do, he still feels that way. I just try to not get sucked into it. If he isn't being receptive then I typically just stop. That is where I believe self-work and healing comes into play. I don't make him feel guilty; he has guilt. And since I cannot stop the guilt, he has to get healing from it, and I am not the one to do that for him. I had to learn so much about mental illness and health and learn not to take any of it personally. Jordan said that one of the main things that has helped her and Justin is when he's honest with her about where he is, emotionally, and now tells her when he's having a bad day and needs some space. The couple do not live together, which Jordan said is better for both of them right now. Jordan: He would try so hard to make a good day when his head was not in a good place, and it almost always failed. He has so much guilt about his behavior and is always waiting for me to \"wake up and move on to someone who is normal and can give me what I need all the time.\" What he doesn't understand is that the good days we have so greatly outweigh any day with anyone else.

When I text him a few times and he responds with something like, \"I haven't slept, I am lost in my mind right now and don't want to say something I don't mean,\" I know he needs space and can respect that. Are there any moments or experiences that stick out as things you wish you'd handled differently? Jordan: Oh god, so many. I put him in a place where my happiness relied on his and that wasn't fair to either of us. I wanted to save him, and if I couldn't it affected me. I thought he could be fixed. It wasn't until my mother, who is a nurse practitioner, said, \"Bipolar is for life, it doesn't go away,\" that it really sank in that I was in it for the long haul. Initially I was angry and insecure, because the person I knew wasn't there anymore. He was there sometimes, and I felt tricked. The more I read about mental illness, the easier it got to maintain my zen. I have been fortunate enough to come to a place where my happiness is first and doesn't rely on anyone else. That was hard, and it took 18 months of counseling. What do \"good days\" look like for you now? Justin: A good day generally consists of very limited stress. No panic attacks. Not having to worry about money or prescriptions or pain. Jordan and I and the kids have a good time as a family, not having any symptoms of mania. Jordan: He is very needy and affectionate, wants to do everything for me, cook, clean, build me a fire, things he knows I love. He spends a lot of money on the good days. My theory is it is to make up for the bad days. It is difficult for me, sometimes, to go from giving him needed space or fighting to being super clingy and openly affectionate. What do bad days look like? Jordan: He needs/wants different things, depending on his state of mind. That has been influenced by different meds docs have him on, or lack of meds or pain levels that day. A particular instance is when he was on a pill binge and we were supposed to be doing maternity photos for a friend and then going to my younger sister's high school graduation. Something snapped and he started arguing about god knows what and ended up leaving with our friend's husband and spending over $500 in crap we didn't need, and then taking my car so I couldn't go to my sister's graduation. Jordan, how do you practice self-care so that you can remain a supportive partner? Jordan: I make music. Justin has been my muse in a lot of ways. I am the lead singer of The High Moons, a four-part, all-female band in Dallas. I write about the things we have been through, and I have been able to reach people in many ways via music. I've heard people tell me their stories of their loves, parents, friends, etc. who have made them feel similar. If my pain can help one person make sense of theirs, I am doing what I am supposed to be doing.\n\nJordan: I also have a vision board and affirmation cards. I have a great therapist who is all about inward work and no blame. I surround myself with music and people who are good, and that heals me. [You have to] protect your children and loved ones as well as your own heart. The person you love is important, but so is everyone else affected by it. What advice do you have for couples going through something similar? Jordan: [When dealing with the VA], try to get a patient advocate on your side there. Usually they can help weed through the bullshit. Counseling is key, but don't just settle for the first counselor you meet. Both parties need to honor themselves by having time alone, or with others, to breathe. Have a nonjudgmental friend to talk to, one that will just let you vent and not try to fix or save it. And do not feel guilty about cutting people out who make the situation worse. Understand that it is for life. Even if a person gets on a good treatment plan, it isn't a cure. Do you have any advice for people with children, where one of the parents is dealing with mental illness? Jordan: Children are not choosing to be there. So they need to be protected and cared for, first and foremost. Try not to fight around them; be honest with them, but age-appropriate. Protect their hearts and minds and never, ever, ever allow the person with mental illness to drag them into anything. After a bad episode once, my daughter (4 years old at the time) said, \"Mommy, I wish Justin's head wasn't sick, I pray for God to make it better.\" Balance it all as much as you can and forgive yourself when you can't. What do you love about each other? Jordan: His wit, humor, manliness, beard, ability to probably survive a zombie apocalypse. He lets me be the strong-willed woman I am, he gives of himself and is willing to help anyone he meets, almost to a fault. He is a great dad and a brilliant mind. Justin: I love her because she accepts me. She has been my rock, my general grasp on reality since I got out of the Navy and rejoined \"reality.\" She has always been there for me to listen when I need someone to listen, to advise when I need advice, to tell me I am wrong when I think I am correct (I'm usually wrong), to call me on my shit and not be afraid to let the cards fall where they may. We have been through the good times and the bad and we're still here. Last but not least, she is an amazing mother and partner and I just cannot see myself without her in my life. She makes me a better person. Do you have any fears about the future? Jordan: Not really. Just, y'know, global warming and shitty music.

T: From the age of 15, I knew I was different. Being gay in the 1960s, you had to live your life in secret. I put my problems down to the fact I was gay and never [considered that it was due to] mental illness. I have suffered for 50 years with OCD and body image issues (anorexia and bulimia). I hid it from my friends and family and suffered many years without help and support. At the age of 43, I met Khakan. I hid from him my depression and other mental health issues, thinking he would never know. Khakan: I was introduced to T through a mutual friend. When I entered his flat that day, I was impressed by how pristine everything looked. I noted how quick he was to move things back into place. He would even plump up the cushions on the sofa if I left the room. As I got to know T over several months, I would see how he would be cleaning, polishing and buffering surfaces, vacuuming, washing down windows. I would wake up at night and find he wasn't in bed. I thought nothing of it, but he later admitted that he was cleaning the windows at 3 or 5 in the morning. I put it down to having a few restless nights. Around the same time, mutual friends told Khakan that T would make himself throw up after meals. Khakan: I didn't realize how bad it was until one evening, I could hear him in the bathroom and it sounded as if he was vomiting. I went into the room, but he shouted at me to get out. I saw that he was deliberately making himself sick. Family and friends would make jokes about his behaviour and say he was a \"nutter\" or laugh and say \"he's just who he is\" and let him get on with it. I couldn't figure it out. About two years later, I heard a psychiatrist on the television describing how some people constantly wash their hands, or switch their lights on and off, check the cooker, and repeat rituals or routines. He described it as \"obsessive-compulsive disorder.\" I researched it. What I read didn't quite match up with the behavior T was displaying. But it did start a discussion about why he did what he did \u2014 the cleaning, polishing, etc. I suggested he seek psychiatric help, but he repeatedly refused, saying that he wasn't crazy. I learnt that pushing someone to do something against their personal beliefs or opinion wouldn't help. So I decided that to leave T to do his own thing would work better for us. It was only a matter of time before I knew he would have to seek help. I had to demonstrate patience and understanding. At the same time, I had to express my feelings very clearly. Then, one day, we saw and heard David Beckham on a daytime show talking to a doctor about how he would line up food items in his cupboard and arrange his socks in his drawers, and the doctor diagnosed a mild form of OCD. T said, \"That's it! That's what I've got!\" We realized that he also had a form of OCD, but it manifested in a different way. T said he felt better knowing that a celebrity shared his \"illness,\" because he then understood that he was not alone. As we talked, it also made me question why he went to the bathroom. He admitted that he was conscious of his body image and had always wanted to be thin. He said he had been sick after every meal for many years. It had started in his mid-teens, when he felt \"image was everything\". I realized he had a severe eating disorder. After much persuasion, he was sent to a doctor who diagnosed bulimia. But the diagnosis didn't put him off. T had learnt to condition his body to reflux after every meal, but control it enough to sustain a relatively healthy-looking body. Things changed when he was about 60. He started to experience suicidal thoughts and took himself to the GP. They diagnosed an underactive thyroid. At the same time, they referred him to a counselor and an eating disorder specialist. The mental health team recognized some of the signs and symptoms that he had with his OCD and eating disorder. They provided invaluable support and encouragement. They discussed issues that he had developed since childhood and in his teen years. Most notably, coming to terms with being gay and wanting to be accepted. After many years and counseling sessions, we learned that T had been brought up in a culture in which being gay was not acceptable. I realized that it was about control. T needed to try and control who he was. Do you have any advice for other couples going through something similar? Khakan: I think in hindsight, the timing to seek professional help could have been better for both of us if he had gone in the earlier stages. But as I said, sometimes you have to learn to manage it as best as you can, especially if they are not willing to recognize they have an illness. Once your partner does accept they need help, grab the opportunity and work with them, support and encourage as best as you can.

For 50 years, I lived in total secrecy about my health issues. It was totally taboo for someone like me, growing up in the 1960s and over three decades, to own up to such health issues. You suffered in silence. Today, the different agencies where you can receive advice, guidance, and information are endless. Now, after receiving support from professionals, I openly tell people I have mental health issues or illnesses. I still suffer with OCD, bulimia, and body image issues, but telling Khakan (even though he knew and always seemed to know!) has helped me to manage my life better and cope with things I would otherwise ignore or hide. Khakan: I suppose some of the counselling sessions have helped. But I think having patience and understanding, and allowing T to describe his feelings or disclose to people who are close to him what he has, is even better. As a society, we are not encouraged to talk about mental illness, but T speaks about what he goes through to close friends so that people can develop a better understanding. Khakan, how do you practice self-care so you can be a supportive partner? Khakan: Communication, talk time, and being creative helps to alleviate the negativity \u2014 i.e., baking, cooking, gardening, art, decorating, listening to music, reading a good book, joining or starting a social/support group, or attending a course. We share the living space, but we also take time for ourselves. We have a cat, which helps to relieve any stresses of the day. I think self-preservation as a couple and as an individual helps to maintain good dynamics in a relationship. I try not to allow his OCD or bulimia to affect our being together. We try to be holistic in our approach \u2014 learn to live and love each other for our flaws, passions, idiosyncrasies, ideas, humor (very important to have in any relationship) behavior, attitude, opinions. The list is endless. What do you love about each other? T: Khakan is strong-minded, determined, and stands up for his convictions, even when it caused problems with his faith and family values. He is liked by everyone who meets him. His devotion to me over the past 24 years, the kindness he shows to others, and the love for me in the good and bad times we've shared. We both have become better people in trying to understand the cruelty that life can throw at you, and still we remain as much in love now as we were all those years ago. We've never tired of each other! Khakan: We are complete opposites yet we complement each other, like yin and yang. I'm much more of a creative dreamer, but he is practical and very down-to-earth. He keeps me grounded. I love his outlook on life, his sensitivities and generosity, his compassion and understanding, his \"orderliness\" in our home. We share similar tastes in music and fashion, but slightly different opinions and viewpoints when it comes to people and situations. I think we fit very well together. T: Without him by my side, I would never have survived to be the person I am today. It's been hard for Khakan to cope with my depression and addictions. But he stood by me! We've been together now 23 years, experienced racial abuse, homophobia, and our families turning their backs on us. We got through it and it made us both better people. Khakan: Maintaining, nurturing, and sustaining a good relationship is hard work. I would say we've worked very hard at our to make it last as long as it has. Twenty-three years in an interracial gay relationship is a very, very, very long time! T: We are still in love 23 years on, and never bored with each other. I cope with my depression and mental health illness knowing Khakan is by my side, my support, my soulmate, my life.

Nancy: I had my first panic attack in 2008, the spring my mother left me again. I felt like I was drowning, but having a heart attack at the same time. Later that day, I wanted to kill myself and kill somebody else, anybody. Daniel talked to me on the phone, reassuring me. But it wasn't enough. I went to the hospital and was diagnosed with anxiety. I got put on antidepressants, the first of many. I married Daniel in November that same year. Something about getting married set me off, and I ended up hospitalized with homicidal thoughts. When I was 11, I was raped by my good friend's stepfather. I've come to learn from therapy that many rape survivors feel anxiety about getting married. Being married made me feel trapped. I told Daniel these thoughts while in bed on Christmas Eve, in 2008. He didn't want to believe me. He tried to reassure me that my thoughts were normal, but I knew they weren't normal when I was having to stop myself from going to get a knife so I could stab Daniel and then myself. I made him take me to the ER, where I was then transported to the nearest psychiatric crisis center. Dan: I didn't really know how seriously to take it at first. I had had similar thoughts in the past, and thought maybe she was just obsessing over disturbing thoughts that popped into her head, afraid that they meant she was a bad person. It wasn't until she told me about the voices that I took it more seriously, and decided to take her to the hospital. It wasn't really a shocking or scary experience for me, to be honest. I'm self-aware enough to realize that I had a relatively sheltered childhood, especially compared to Nancy's. Nancy: I was at the local crisis center. I was terrified. I'd never been in a hospital like that before. I couldn't sleep in the bedroom they assigned me due to my anxiety about somebody hurting me, so I slept in the \"living room.\" They gave me Geodon, which got rid of the horrible thoughts, but made me a walking zombie. Dan visited me as often as he could. I called him as often as I could, crying all the way. Overall, I was relieved to be on a medicine that stopped the suicidal and homicidal thoughts, even if it did make me beyond sleepy. I was diagnosed as severe depressive with psychotic features. After my complaining, they put me on Abilify instead. Dan: The Abilify worked much better, but then she got pregnant and had to stop taking it. She did fine throughout the pregnancy, but she ended up getting postpartum depression, and hated herself for not feeling connected to our son. She woke me up one night, saying she heard voices telling her to kill me and our son, and she was finding it hard not to listen to them. She ended up in another crisis center for a few days, and her psychiatrist changed her medication. Nancy: It took me three years or so to get the proper diagnosis. Once I did, I was stable until just this year, when I had a relapse when we changed my meds. Dan: I should also mention that she really hates taking the anxiety pills. She is absolutely filled with hatred towards me and herself when she takes them sometimes. In late 2014, Dan changed jobs and took a big pay cut. He says Nancy started to get more stressed at her teaching job and decided to finish out the school year and then quit to focus on writing. She ended up in the hospital again before the school year was over, and almost immediately after the school year ended in summer 2015, she entered another manic phase. What do bad days look like for you? Nancy: My most recent manic episode, I slept with I don't know how many men (hypersexuality can be a sign of mania/bipolar disorder) and I wanted to divorce Daniel and get my own place. I don't like talking about it, because I'm so ashamed of it. I was making lifelong decisions in a matter of days. Dan: I didn't realize she was manic at first, and I didn't know how to react, but I knew I couldn't force her to stay with me, so I had to let her go. Fortunately we realized what was going on before she got a job or moved out. Her psychiatrist adjusted her medication, and changed her diagnosis to Bipolar I. Nancy: My psychiatrist upped my Abilify and as soon as that kicked in, I had the worst emotional hangover in the world. All the things I did suddenly hit me and I realized that the path I was on was very self-destructive. My psychiatrist and Dan helped me realize this, but so did the medication. Dan: She's doing better now, and is trying to focus on writing, but it's a struggle because she feels like she isn't contributing to the family. We did just get approved for Social Security Disability Insurance, however, so we are hoping that will help relieve some of the stress. Nancy seeing herself as a burden is one of the most emotionally difficult things for me to deal with. Last spring before she was hospitalized, she had a string of panic attacks and during two of those attacks, she begged me to let her kill herself. She tried to convince me that my life would be easier without her. But I don't see how my life could possibly be any better if she killed herself. Living with the guilt of failing her and the children would be a much greater burden, and I wouldn't have my best friend to help me through it. How do you reassure her when she's seeing herself as a burden? Dan: I remind her that the best thing she can do for all of us is to take care of herself. Me doing all the chores isn't a burden when I know that it frees her up to work on writing or spending some extra time with the kids. I've never seriously considered leaving Nancy, because I really don't think I would be any happier. I was actually somewhat depressed before I met Nancy, and she helps pull me out of my head and deal with life. Share On email Share On email\n\nShare On link Share On link Share This Link\n\nShare On facebook Share On facebook Share\n\nDan, how do you practice self-care so you can be a supportive husband? Dan: Most days I have to choose between getting a full night's rest or having some alone time for an hour or two before going to bed. It also helps that I have a long-term outlook on life, and I just keep telling myself that the kids will be old enough to get themselves ready for school and bed someday. I have a couple of friends I occasionally talk to about some of this stuff, but not very often and not in great detail. My parents are very supportive financially and with helping take care of the kids, but I think they struggle with taking her condition seriously sometimes. If you have friends or family that can help you take care of the kids, then absolutely use them. Don't think you're a bad parent if you need someone else to take care of the kids on a regular basis in order to relieve some stress. What do good days look like now? Nancy: Good days are me working on becoming a published author and actually getting a lot of writing done. Good days are me not having an anxiety attack or feeling worthless. Has her mental illness affected your sex life at all? Nancy: My medicine makes it hard to orgasm and it decreases my sex drive, so it has affected our sex lives in a negative way. And we have two kiddos, so that hurts it, too (lol). Dan: Before her manic episode last summer, we had sex maybe 10 times a year. We haven't had sex since her manic episode. It doesn't help that I have become a sort of parental figure in her life, because I spend so much time helping to take care of her. Do you have any advice for other couples going through something like this? Dan: Don't freak out and judge your spouse if they ever start having panic attacks or suicidal/homicidal thoughts. Take them seriously and try to help if you can. If the person can't be consoled, take them to the hospital, or call 911 if you don't think a car ride would be safe. For all mental illness, do not belittle the thoughts and emotions of your spouse. Don't tell them they just need to \"think positive\" or \"get over it.\" People have said similar things to my wife, which infuriates her and makes her feel like a failure at the same time. Nancy: My advice for couples is that you have to be able to communicate without repercussions. Daniel has never once used anything against me in our arguments. (\"Well, you know you once wanted to kill me...\" kind of thing.) The partner with the disorder has to realize that it can be managed, but when it can't, when the disorder is bigger than them, they need their spouse's support.

You can also get support via text from 3 to 11 p.m. on Samaritans Statewide Helpline, 877-870-HOPE (4673).

It's intended to be the first step in making information easier to access, the groups said.\n\n\"Clinical depression is a very common condition \u2014 in fact, approximately one in five Americans experience an episode in their lifetime,\" Mary Giliberti, CEO of the National Alliance on Mental Health, wrote on Google's blog. \"However, despite its prevalence, only about 50 percent of people who suffer from depression actually receive treatment.\" From Google's point of view, the questionnaire serves the double benefit of giving people a reason to spend even more time on search results. One in 20 searches are for health-related information, the company has said. So in early 2015, Google introduced blocks of information about more than 400 health and medical conditions \u2014 such as the one for depression \u2014 into its mobile search results. Search results aside, Google's parent company has also shown interest in treating depression directly. Thomas Insel, a top neuroscientist and former director of the National Institute of Mental Health, was recruited to Verily, Alphabet's experimental life-sciences team, to develop ways of using smartphone sensors to screen for signs of depression and mental illness. He left this year for a startup with a similar mission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStephanie Lee is a senior technology reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in San Francisco. Contact Stephanie M.

Here are some of their stories. Transitioning can mean many different things, and it's a unique process for each individual. Sometimes, it may be a social change (changing clothing, pronouns, and names). For others, transitioning may involve medical interventions (hormone therapy, surgery). Or it may be a combination of different things \u2014 it really depends on the individual to decide which changes (if any) to make and when to make them. A quick note: We included a range of people and experiences, but the stories below don't represent everyone who identifies as transgender, or everyone who struggles with mental health. And just a heads up, some of these submissions discuss suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders.

After transitioning, I started feeling things \u2014 even being sad was amazing because it meant I was alive.\u201d Before transitioning, I was completely numb. I didn't feel happiness or joy, nor sadness or sorrow. I felt dead on the inside, like I was acting out a script someone else had written for me. After deciding to transition, it was as if all my life the whole world had been a sepia movie, and all of a sudden it got colors. I started feeling lots of things for the first time \u2014 even being sad was amazing because it meant I was alive. I made lots of friends and discovered I'm actually kind of extroverted, even though I used to think I was rather aloof. Even my friends say I look noticeably happier this way. I feel more alive than ever, and I'm loving it. On the other hand, it was a huge change for my family, but once they learned I was better off this way, they were fully supportive. \u2014Sophie, 22, Woman Share On email Share On email\n\nShare On link Share On link Share This Link\n\nShare On facebook Share On facebook Share\n\n3. \u201cHaving to present female in public caused me so much anxiety that I just hid from everyone.

It took me a while to come to terms with being trans. In college I joined a sorority in hopes that I would feel more \"feminine\". That 100% did not work, and if anything it really helped me come to terms with my gender identity. Wearing female clothes and going by female pronouns caused me so much stress that I stopped going to class and speaking to people. I kind of just shut down. Having to present female in public caused me so much anxiety that I just hid from everyone. Now that I'm about a year and a half into my transition, my depression no longer consumes my life and is manageable. There are days when I still feel dysphoric, but when I look in the mirror and see the physical changes, it doesn't affect me as much as it use to. I still get anxious whenever I run into people from high school or from college who haven't seen me since I've transitioned. But thankfully I have an amazing group of friends who immediately started using male pronouns and called me by the name I wanted to be referred to. Overall, my mental health has improved drastically. Little things like going out with friends or meeting new people use to feel unbearable, but now I am more confident and enjoy being out and interacting with people. \u2014Kenneth, 24, Transman\n\n5. \u201cBefore, I had panic attacks when I had to say my name or state my gender\u2026 now the progress in my mental health is amazing.\u201d Before, I struggled with depression and anxiety, as well as self harm and suicidal tendencies. I was constantly nervous and uncomfortable, shaking and fidgeting all the time, and had regular panic attacks when I had to say my name or state my gender. I stopped eating and sleeping at a certain point, lost 15kg in two months, and ended up at a psychiatrist, who prescribed me antidepressants. So far, my transition has been only social \u2014 changing my haircut and clothes. However, I noticed that I can't help but smile and feel happy every time a friend or family member uses my correct name or pronouns. I'm smiling a lot, laughing with my friends, and eating normally. I still fidget a lot when out in public, out of fear of strangers who can get hostile and start asking me questions. Toilets are also a very unpleasant situation that gives me way too much anxiety, and I occasionally still get panic attacks when I have to use them. However, given that my transition has mostly been social so far, I think the progress in my mental health is amazing. \u2014Oliver, 18, male Share On email Share On email\n\nShare On link Share On link Share This Link\n\nShare On facebook Share On facebook Share\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. \u201cI still have clinical depression \u2014 I knew testosterone wouldn't cure me \u2014 but my depressive episodes are significantly less severe, and few and far between.\u201d I've suffered from severe clinical depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember. I spent half my life in denial about my gender identity, which exacerbated my depression. I self-injured for several years and attempted suicide. I hated every aspect of myself, especially my outward appearance, no matter how hard to tried to just accept the body I was born with. I spent a year socially transitioning before beginning my medical transition. Every time friends called me by my new name, it made me feel great. I started testosterone in February 2017. I'm now 2 days shy of my 7 months on testosterone and I continue to feel wonderful. I still have clinical depression \u2014 I knew testosterone wouldn't cure me \u2014 but my depressive episodes are significantly less severe and few and far between. The only thing that ever really gets me down these days is how out of reach top surgery feels. But otherwise, I'm so much happier since beginning my medical transition. I feel incredibly lucky to be where I am and to have such an amazing support system. \u2014Aiden Quinn P., 31, trans man Share On email Share On email\n\nShare On link Share On link Share This Link\n\nShare On facebook Share On facebook Share\n\n9. \u201cI am much more laid back and not as riddled with anxiety as I used to be\u2026 I even cut back on my meds.\u201d Before transitioning, I had a lot of social anxiety and very low self-confidence. In addition to these, I had \"therapy-resistant\" chronic migraines ever since first puberty. Every step of the way \u2014 coming out, socially transitioning, medically transitioning, and even just the steps to start a medical transition \u2014 has made me more comfortable with myself. Suddenly I find myself being okay with, and almost anxiety-free, when meeting new people. I am much more laid back and not as riddled with anxiety as I used to be. My chronic migraines have gotten better. I even cut back on my meds a couple of weeks ago. I have good hopes to be able to get off (almost) all of them. \u2014Jerome Abalone, 23, male, FTM Share On email Share On email\n\nShare On link Share On link Share This Link\n\nShare On facebook Share On facebook Share\n\n11. \u201cA major part of my transitioning has been getting a great therapist who has helped me deal with my mental health.\u201d Before, I was incredibly depressed and angry at all times. I honestly don't know how I was able to function. It felt like I was in a dark pit I couldn't see the end of. I felt completely alone and powerless. A major part of my transitioning has been getting a great therapist who has helped me deal with my mental health in general. Once I got on HRT [hormone replacement therapy] and got top surgery, it was like I suddenly could see the end of that pit I was in. My self confidence was boosted and I was able to function with a clearer and happier mindset. I still get depressed on occasion, but whereas before when I'd be depressed I'd hyper-focus on that fact I was trans, now I am able to love myself for who I am and not fall down into a really dark place again. \u2014Toby, 21, Trans Man Share On email Share On email\n\nShare On link Share On link Share This Link\n\nShare On facebook Share On facebook Share\n\nAdvertisement\n\n13. \u201cI still deal with a lot of anxiety about my identity and the way people perceive me, but I feel much less trapped than I used to.\u201d Before deciding to transition, I struggled so much to understand myself. I clung onto every new label I found, hoping that it would be the definitive answer I was seeking, but was always left unsatisfied. In high school I had a serious problem with isolating myself, since I didn't know where to fit in with my peer groups. It was very lonely and I struggled with a lot of suicidal thoughts and anxiety. I'm still in the midst of transitioning socially as a sophomore in college, and still trying to discern what lies in my future as far as medical transition. However, since I've changed the way I present I've never felt more like myself. I still deal with a lot of anxiety about my identity and the way people perceive me, but I feel much less trapped than I used to. The more that I move forward in my transition, the more confident I feel in myself and my identity. Dysphoria is a big struggle for me, but that's only because I've finally realized what was \"wrong\" with me and can now see a path forward. \u2014Anonymous, trans male/nonbinary Share On email Share On email\n\nShare On link Share On link Share This Link\n\nShare On facebook Share On facebook Share\n\n15. \u201cI struggle most in dealing with my family and their poor reactions to my transition. But overall, I'm so much happier.\u201d Before, I had chronic depression, dysphoria-induced low mood, and I avoided looking at myself in mirrors. Now that I'm seeing changes from the hormones, I actually want to look at myself in the mirror again. I don't get those random 'bad days' anymore. My self confidence is growing and I feel so much more comfortable and at ease. I struggle most in dealing with my family, and their poor reactions to my transition have led to a few minor depressive episodes on my end. But overall, I'm so much happier and I'm looking forward to seeing where my transition takes me. \u2014Sam, 23, trans man Share On email Share On email\n\nShare On link Share On link Share This Link\n\nShare On facebook Share On facebook Share\n\nAdvertisement\n\n17. \u201cBeing able to voice my true self, wear a binder, and go by correct pronouns has genuinely saved my life.\u201d My mental health was very, very poor. Keeping such a huge part of myself hidden before starting my transition was not only mentally straining, but it also made me constantly feel vulnerable, like at any moment someone might discover my secret. Being on high alert all the time was detrimental to my overall wellbeing. Just coming out made an immense difference. I am currently pre-hormones or surgeries, so as I have mostly just come out and started transitioning, that alone has helped. Being able to voice my true self, wear a binder, and go by correct pronouns has genuinely saved my life. My constant depression and anxiety has lessened, making it manageable to get through the day and stay confident and happy in myself. \u2014Malcolm, 21, FTM transgender man Share On email Share On email\n\nShare On link Share On link Share This Link\n\nShare On facebook Share On facebook Share\n\n19. \"My mental health was very poor.

I was crying every day, self harming, pushing away people who cared about me and I had extreme anxiety. I felt hopeless and I had no idea why. My body was a stranger to me. It seemed as though my life was coming to an end. Since I started transitioning, my mental health has dramatically improved! I feel genuine joy in life now that I have a future.

After, it was like waking up after a bad dream. I felt mentally strong and lucid for the first time in my life.\u201d Before transitioning, I was a terrible ball of anxiety and depression. I was so unhappy all of the time and I didn't know what to do about those feelings. Nothing made me feel even remotely okay. I tried therapy and antidepressants with no luck. I dreaded getting out of bed and having to leave my house. I looked in the mirror and hated everything I saw. I was so unhappy for so long I didn't see a way out of the misery. Within a few weeks of starting testosterone, I felt something I had never felt before: happiness. I felt a calm presence in my life. I didn't have the constant anxiety and fear or dread of something horrible around the corner. It was like waking up after a bad dream. I felt mentally strong and really lucid for the first time in my life. Transitioning and being on testosterone has given me something to live for.\n\n\u2014Britton, 26, TransMan Share On email Share On email\n\nShare On link Share On link Share This Link\n\nShare On facebook Share On facebook Share\n\n24. \u201cOnce I felt more comfortable living in my own skin, I was able to explore the things that hurt me before transitioning and make peace with them.\u201d I was a hot, angry, suicidal mess with a lot of explosive and self harming tendencies. I would regularly scream at other drivers or punch holes in walls out of frustration. Honestly, I was totally out of control. I was suicidal all the time even at the (then) height of my career, I just wanted to end my life without hurting my family. I think when I was further into my transition, it allowed me to see life from a new perspective. Once I felt more comfortable living in my own skin, I was able to explore the things that hurt me before transitioning and make peace with them. Transitioning was only a piece of the puzzle for me but nonetheless the biggest piece. Going from taking down mirrors in my home to being proud, happy, and connected to my body was something I never thought would happen. \u2014Harper, 25, transfemale Share On email Share On email\n\nShare On link Share On link Share This Link\n\nShare On facebook Share On facebook Share\n\n26. \"My depression is more manageable, but my anxiety has gotten worse. As the only out person in my office, I feel like I have to be an example for the whole trans community and I have to have all the answers.\u201d I've had a lot of trouble with my mental health. I've suffered with depression since I was 10 and I've had anxiety since I was 14. They have been constant companions, despite years and medicine and therapy. My depression has been more manageable since beginning transitioning. However, as I've gone through the process, my anxiety has actually gotten worse. At work, I went from a relative nobody to someone who's progress seems to be known by everyone. As the only out person in my office, I feel like I have to be an example for the whole trans community and I have to have all the answers. There have been times where I've been asked to do talks and interviews for work events when I really just want to hide away and be anonymous. There is so much hatred thrown around online that sometimes I'm afraid to even go outside with my binder on or without shaving. When I'm finally done with transitioning, I hope to feel more comfortable being myself out in the world. \u2014RW, 28, Male Share On email Share On email\n\nShare On link Share On link Share This Link\n\nShare On facebook Share On facebook Share\n\n29. \u201cI discovered a kind of confidence in myself I hadn't felt since childhood, and I finally started to understand that life was worth living.\u201d As soon as I hit puberty, my mental health went into rapid decline. I lost the ability to make friends and communicate with people because of the weight of my mental dysphoria. I figured, \"if I don't value myself, no one else ever could.\" I developed extreme anxiety and took part in many self-harming behaviors, and in the back of my mind I didn't expect to make it to my senior year of high school. As soon as I came out socially and started to make significant changes, it was as if a black and white filter had been removed from my vision. I discovered a kind of confidence in myself I hadn't felt since childhood, and I finally started to understand that life was worth living. My physical health has improved because I've been feeding and resting my body properly. For the first time in my life, I began waking up in the morning with the strength to take on the day. I was disappointed to realize that some parts of my mental health (phobias, obsessive disorder) would not be cured by transitioning, but they no longer feel all- consuming.

But looking back, I was probably depressed. I would cry over the tiniest things. I was known for being really quiet. I never participated in class. And I never wanted to go places or do things in public. I was so afraid they all somehow knew I wasn't a \"real girl\" or would find out I was trans. I came out and socially transitioned about three years ago. It was incredibly relieving to be myself around my friends. Suddenly I was able to participate and talk to my classmates. I started taking testosterone 6 months ago and at this point, most people assume I'm a cis guy unless I say otherwise. T has made me feel so much better about myself. It's insane to think of how much I've changed over the past few months \u2014 it's like a switch flipped. I'm motivated to work on things like my career, my health, and my relationships.

I felt disconnected from my job, my spouse, and my family; it was as though I was going through life in a numb haze without clear direction. I knew something was wrong with me but I didn't know exactly what it was. I consider myself fully transitioned to female now. While there were a lot of milestones during my journey, there were two key points where I noticed a big change in my mental health. The first was when I was able to clearly say to myself, \"I am a woman.\" That knocked me out of my haze and I felt like I had a clear purpose for the first time in life. I felt genuinely in tune with my emotions and my mental health and my life clicked into place. I realized I wasn't mentally ill, just different. The second turning point in my mental health came after my gender confirmation surgery. When the bandages came off, I looked down at myself and for the first time in my life I felt truly at home in my body. The dysphoria was now little but a whisper in my ear. The burden of living in a body that doesn't fit your own perception of who you are is a very real one. For me, surgery was an amazing psychological therapy that freed me from that burden.\n\n\u2014Melanie, 34, transwoman\n\n34. \u201cI'm no longer depressed to the point of suicide, but now there are many more decent and okay days rather than bad ones\u201d My mental health was very poor. I had been suicidal on and off (it seemed to be on for a month or two, and then off for a week or so) from about 13 until when I began transitioning last year. I'm no longer depressed to the point of suicide, although I'm still struggling with depression and a bit of dysphoria on and off. It depends on the day, but now there are many more decent and ok days rather than bad ones. Overall, I'm definitely happier, and I'm looking forward to feeling more and more comfortable in my own skin as I continue to transition. So far, I haven't done much beyond cut my hair, throw out all my skirts, and ask for people to call me Mike rather than my birth name, but it has definitely lifted a great weight off of me. \u2014Mike, 20, FTM Share On email Share On email\n\nShare On link Share On link Share This Link\n\nShare On facebook Share On facebook Share\n\n[Responses have been edited for length and clarity.]\n\nIf you need to talk to someone immediately, you can reach the Trans Lifeline at 877-565-8860, or any of the resources available through The Trevor Project here, including the Trevor Lifeline, TrevorChat, and TrevorText.\n\nCaroline Kee is a health writer for BuzzFeed News and is based in New York.

Kids go through ups and downs just like adults, but when those downs start causing problems in everyday life, it's probably time to talk to a professional, like us. Trouble paying attention, being disorganized, worrying, trouble sleeping. Whether you're a kid or an adult, everyone experiences these from time to time. But in mental illness, these symptoms are often more severe. In fact, when trying to figure out if you should go see a professional, think about whether these symptoms in your child are happening 1) more frequently than the average person of that age, 2) more severely than the average person of that age, and 3) if all of this is making it hard for your child to function in every day life. If all three add up, then it could be time to talk to someone who can help.

Kids as young as 2 can start showing signs of an anxiety or a behavior disorder. The signs may vary, but there are children who exhibit extreme tantrums or aggression, are completely avoidant of social situations, or show anxiousness over things that most other kids their age wouldn\u2019t be concerned about. We've literally seen 7-year-old kids worrying obsessively about the war in Afghanistan and the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. And when it comes to developmental delays, like those related to autism, they can show up even earlier, in a baby as young as 6 months old.

Because it's hard to know right away which particular disorder a kid has, we first narrow it down seeing which of two major buckets their symptoms fit into. We usually ask this question: Is it an internalizing disorder or externalizing disorder? Internalizing disorders are those only the person experiencing them can feel, like bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, and adjustment issues. Externalizing disorders are those like ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder, the symptoms of which are usually seen by people in that person\u2019s life. Since there are so many mental illnesses \u2014 and variations of them \u2014 fitting the symptoms into one of these two categories gives us a general direction to go in. From there, we\u2019ll be able to develop an evidence-based treatment plan.

We wish there was a one-size-fits-all way to go about treating kids, but there's not. So many parents come to us wanting concrete answers about what they and their kids are dealing with and how to tackle very specific issues, such as tantrums, but unfortunately it's more complicated than that. Some kids might need a certain kind of therapy \u2014 outpatient or inpatient therapy; family therapy, involving not only the parents and their child, but siblings, too; or cognitive behavioral therapy \u2014 while others might need medications plus therapy. Other kids, such as those with eating or mood disorders, might need a specialized program where only the child and their parents participate. No two patients will have the same exact treatment, and that's because every treatment plan is meant to teach your child the skills they need to develop into fully functioning adults.

If you think your child is showing signs of mental illness, talk to the other adults in your kid's life. We'll usually make a diagnosis based on the entire history of your child from birth, including their family, school, and social histories. So if you think your child is showing signs, talk to other parents to get an idea of how your kid might compare, developmentally; talk to their teachers/counselors, who spend lots of time with them every day; and talk to their primary care provider, who knows their medical history (and can refer you to a mental health professional). Taken together, these are all clues that will help you figure out what your kid is going through and how to help them.

The more parents and guardians can support their kids at home, the better. Ideally, everyone in the child's life \u2014 from siblings to teachers to babysitters and coaches \u2014 should be on board with helping the child with a mental illness thrive, but parents/guardians are their greatest partners in overcoming the difficulties of living with a mental illness. Share On email Share On email\n\nShare On link Share On link Share This Link\n\nShare On facebook Share On facebook Share\n\n7. And btw, if that sounds overwhelming, it\u2019s our job to help parents learn how to do this. Kids do not exist in isolation, so we work with their parents/guardians, too. That usually means figuring out the best ways for them to be partners in their child\u2019s care. As much as we provide treatment for kids, we provide resources and support for parents, too. Share On email Share On email\n\nShare On link Share On link Share This Link\n\nShare On facebook Share On facebook Share\n\n8. If we could recommend two skills for kids to learn ASAP, they\u2019d be communication and problem solving. If you set the foundation for communication early on \u2014 modeling deep listening and trying to understand where your kids are coming from \u2014 the door will be open for them to speak comfortably with you when it really matters, regardless of the topic or who starts the conversation. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to listen to them, rather than talk at them. Likewise, a lot of parents assume it's their job to find solutions to all of their kid's problems, but, in our opinion, that\u2019s not actually the best setup. At some point in their teen years, they\u2019ll need to start learning to solve problems on their own. For parents, that means asking kids to come up with solutions to their challenges and obstacles (within reason!), and then having them try things out on their own. Sometimes it might work and sometimes it might fail, but that's OK: The goal is to teach them resilience, not reliance. Share On email Share On email\n\nShare On link Share On link Share This Link\n\nShare On facebook Share On facebook Share\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. The other thing we need to ask parents to do: Be pretty involved in their therapy process. That means asking questions about literally everything, from what skills your child should be learning to the skills you should be working on with them at home. You want to have an idea of what the outlook is, and if, after some time, you don't see much improvement, then have a conversation with the therapist \u2014 you might realize, or they might even tell you, that it's time to see a specialist or get a second opinion.

We don\u2019t usually expect kids (especially younger ones) to be pros at articulating their inner emotional landscape. Developmentally, young children aren't ~there~ yet, where they're able to grasp and discuss abstract concepts. They also have limited insight and awareness of who they are and what's going on. So if they\u2019re always worried, for example, and you asked them to think about their negative thoughts and to talk to those thoughts, they probably wouldn't be able to put it into words. Share On email Share On email\n\nShare On link Share On link Share This Link\n\nShare On facebook Share On facebook Share\n\n11. But that\u2019s OK, because we are pretty good at getting it all out anyway. There isn\u2019t really a single specific way we\u2019d tackle this since it depends on the child\u2019s age and treatment, but to build rapport and open them up, we might try playing games with them or drawing. These are, themselves, therapies, but they also work to put the children more at ease \u2014 the child might feel more comfortable talking about their feelings while playing these games \u2014 and that can help them engage in the therapeutic process. Similarly, these techniques may expose certain behaviors (if the child gets frustrated, for example) and that can prompt a conversation, too.

There\u2019s always the chance that a kid\u2019s diagnosis might change. Treating mental illnesses often means treating the symptoms of the disorder as they appear, so that they're less of an impediment on the child's life right now. But things change \u2014 kids mature, their brains develop, and they\u2019re exposed to more and more things in the world. All these things can affect the symptoms they have, how they're able to talk about their symptoms, and, ultimately, their diagnosis. It's also worth mentioning that not all mental illnesses develop at the same speed \u2014 some may be more of a slow burn, with symptoms popping up over a few months or years, whereas the full scope of other illnesses can show up much faster. When this happens, it\u2019s not necessarily the fault of whoever made the original diagnosis \u2014 they were working with the symptoms that were present at the time... Unfortunately, this is one of the harder things we have to deal with since it can be so frustrating for parents.

We all go through similar training at first, but eventually each of us will choose a path to specialize in. Describe our schooling in one word? LENGTHY. It can take about six to seven years of training to be a clinical psychologist, and that might include clinical internships or postdoctoral fellowships. All this extensive training basically sets us up with the skills to provide therapy, psychological testing, and research. We all come out of that training knowing these things, but because there are so many mental illnesses out there, we usually find something to specialize in, whether that's mood disorders and severe pathologies or ADHD and behavior problems.

One of the biggest misconceptions about mental health professionals in general is that right away we're going to prescribe medication for whatever the illness is. Sometimes this keeps people from going to see a professional, and other times this is the first thing people ask about. Well, it turns out that psychologists cannot prescribe meds in the first place (we\u2019re not MDs!), and even if we could, they wouldn't be our first treatment option. Why? Because we know that there are all sorts of therapies that might work without having to resort to meds.

Consistency is huge when it comes to treatment being as effective as possible. When it comes to getting the most out of outpatient therapy, it's crucial that kids\u2019 visits are consistent \u2014 you can't just come by whenever there's a problem, especially if your child\u2019s issues are particularly serious. Oftentimes, the only thing a child needs to stay on track will be consistent therapy sessions. Without them, there's potential for conflicts to arise between family members or for the child to have a full-on mental health crisis, where the only way to stabilize them is in the ER or an inpatient hospital. And we definitely don\u2019t want that to happen. Share On email Share On email\n\nShare On link Share On link Share This Link\n\nShare On facebook Share On facebook Share\n\n16. Insurance coverage for mental health services is actually one of the biggest obstacles to consistent care. Sure, this is a problem for anyone looking for mental health treatment, but that doesn't mean it isn't important. Mental health care is covered at a lower rate than other medical illnesses \u2014 that ices out families who can't afford to pay copays or see a really good mental health professional. Sometimes insurance companies will even put a cap on the number of sessions a family is allowed to have. Unfortunately, with so many challenges to getting care, therapy ends up being a last resort for many families.

It's true: Teens can get moody, irritable, and argumentative. But when these behaviors become extreme or disruptive, it might be a sign of a bigger problem. All kids go through puberty, so there's bound to be changes in their behavior, whether that's teen angst, fighting for independence, etc. Of course, it's hard to tell what's \"typical\" teen behavior and what's next level, but go with your gut and also be aware of common warning signs. And don't forget you can always try having a conversation with them or looking into therapy options.

Lots of teens use social media as an emotional outlet, which we wish parents were way more aware of. It's really common in today\u2019s world for teenagers to use social media and the internet as an outlet for their emotional issues \u2014 whether that\u2019s just talking about being sad or even talking about suicide \u2014 probably because it\u2019s easier to say things more freely online than it is in person. But parents won't catch these things if they're not monitoring their child's social media. Instead, it'll probably be one of the kid\u2019s friends who reports the issue back to the parent, or to a teacher or counselor. Every family\u2019s values are different when it comes to privacy, so parents need to figure out what feels right for them in terms of staying on top of what their kids are posting online. Tracking how they expressing themselves online can help you keep tabs on their wellbeing and, if something they say sounds an alarm, you\u2019ll be able to check in with them.

From research, we know that there are A LOT of treatments that are effective. Of course, there are a bunch of factors that influence this, including the kind of therapy being used, the skill set of the therapist, the diagnosis of the child, and their consistency in going to therapy. But the bottom line is there\u2019s a very high likelihood that the child and their family will benefit and see improvements if they go to therapy.

There are definitely times when the job can be especially tough on our hearts. We are humans with our own emotions, too. So it can be tough seeing kids and their families dealing with so much hardship. For us, the hardest things are seeing patients admitted to inpatient facilities for their mental illnesses or dealing with a mental illness on top of another serious medical illness, like cancer. It\u2019s hard to see patients dealing with a lengthy hospital stay, unknown trajectory, or painful procedure, because it almost makes sense as to why they're having behavior problems, or are anxious or depressed. Share On email Share On email\n\nShare On link Share On link Share This Link\n\nShare On facebook Share On facebook Share\n\n21. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s all about helping this generation of kids feel better than the last. Regardless of our own feelings, it's our job to help our patients understand and process their emotions, and let go of unhealthy patterns. We do this because we truly care about helping families and their kids function better \u2014 and by extension, future generations who will learn these skills. If we do that, then we can work to erase mental health stigma and start appreciating people with mental illness for who they are, instead of focusing on their illness or symptoms.

That\u2019s the message from a pioneering clinic in Sacramento, California.\n\nBy the age of 15, Pangcha Vang was in serious trouble, weighed down by untreated depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Six years before, a male relative had started to sexually abuse her. But her family had rejected her cries for help. Some told her to wear different clothes and shout \u201cstop.\u201d Others called her a liar.\n\nVang\u2019s teenage years were chaotic. Her older brother struggled with drug abuse, and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. During psychotic breaks, he became paranoid and violent. Vang and her younger siblings would lock themselves in a bedroom, while their parents, ethnic Hmong refugees from the mountains of Laos who had fled persecution and war, toiled long hours in the fields of California\u2019s Central Valley. Vang sees her abuse, and her family\u2019s failure to confront it, as a symptom of a society in which women are subservient to men. \u201cIt turns into action. You get molested or you get beat,\u201d she told BuzzFeed News. Fortunately for Vang, at 15 she found help at the Transcultural Wellness Center in Sacramento, which adapts the practice of western psychiatry to the needs of the city\u2019s diverse Asian communities.\n\nEight years later, Vang is a poster child for awareness of mental health problems in the Hmong residents of California\u2019s state capital \u2014 literally. In February, her smiling face appeared on city billboards, with the words: \u201cSister. College student. Living with posttraumatic stress disorder.\u201d It was part of a publicity campaign by the Sacramento County Department of Health to battle stigma against mental illness. Alongside her studies at Sacramento State, Vang is now helping other Hmong use the counseling and psychiatric services of the Transcultural Wellness Center. It is vital work: Traumatic refugee experiences, lingering stigma against mental illness, and isolation from mainstream American society mean that elder Hmong, in particular, carry a heavy burden of untreated psychiatric illness. The Transcultural Wellness Center was born in 2002, a collaboration between the county health department, the nonprofit Asian-Pacific Community Counseling, and the University of California, Davis. Its goal is to break down the barriers that prevent underserved Asian communities from getting the mental health care they need \u2014 by working with their cultures, rather than imposing western ideas about mental health. \u201cWhat we call PTSD, a lot of my patients will also conceptualize as the loss of a soul,\u201d the clinic\u2019s medical director, Hendry Ton, told BuzzFeed News. And that\u2019s something that Ton, a Vietnamese-American professor of psychiatry at Davis, knows better than to dismiss. His center will even help arrange for a Hmong shaman to conduct a traditional \u201csoul calling\u201d ceremony \u2014 to help make patients spiritually whole \u2014 as well as providing medication and psychotherapy. What Ton calls \"cultural humility\" works both ways. He has seen some patients make huge progress after a shaman ritual, and it doesn't matter to him that science has no good explanation for that. \"Whenever I talk to my clients about options, I say 'Have you tried approaches from the community that you belong to? Can you help me understand those?'\" In turn,Ton said, \u201cthey become more open to what I have to say about my culture, which is the clinical sciences.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Transcultural Wellness Center serves about 250 people from communities speaking eight Asian languages, including the third-largest ethnic Hmong population in America. The first wave of Hmong immigration, mostly via refugee camps in Thailand, came in the late 1970s, following a disastrous alliance with the U.S. in the Vietnam War. From the mid-1960s, Hmong soldiers disrupted the Ho Chi Minh trail, which ran through Laos and was used by North Vietnam to supply the Viet Cong guerillas. After the U.S. military pulled out in 1975, their Hmong allies were persecuted and killed in large numbers by Laotian communists. Many Hmong elders bear the mental scars of this traumatic period. And having Hmong staff members who understand this dreadful legacy from personal experience is crucial to the center\u2019s work. Growing up in Portland, Oregon, psychiatrist Pachida Lo noticed that her Hmong community seemed to be \u201cstagnant\u201d and isolated, compared to other Asian Americans \u2014 even other refugees from the conflicts in Southeast Asia. \u201cThey had been so sad for so long,\u201d Lo told BuzzFeed News. This malaise still affects Lo\u2019s own family. She recognizes signs of PTSD in one family member, who has yet to accept that he needs help. His symptoms have eased from their peak \u2014 when he would hallucinate that \u201cghost women\u201d were trying to drown him. But it has been difficult for the family to discuss his problems in terms of mental illness, in part because untreated PTSD is seen as \u201cnormal\u201d among Hmong refugees. \u201cA lot of people had such similar symptoms,\u201d Lo said. As well as treating Hmong patients, Lo is conducting research to better understand how mental illness is understood in the community \u2014 finding that previous efforts to do so had gotten lost in translation. The few psychiatrists who had attempted to understand how depression is experienced by Hmong people, by doing anthropological studies in mountain villages in Laos, had been told about a condition called tu siab \u2014 or \u201cbroken liver,\u201d translated literally from formal Hmong speech. However, Lo\u2019s interviews with elderly Hmong patients have revealed that they actually associate depression with the heart \u2014 much closer to the way in which other cultures describe intense sadness. \u201cNo Hmong people really associate the liver with depressive or mental health symptoms,\u201d Lo said. The confusion probably arose because siab is also a slang word for the chest. But Hmong culture and language aren\u2019t just obstacles to better mental health \u2014 they can also be used to break down those barriers. In a poignant YouTube video posted in February, Vang recounted her brother\u2019s and her own experiences with mental illness by adapting a Hmong art form called a \u201cstory cloth.\u201d The lilting Hmong narration broke into English only for terms \u2014 like \u201cschizophrenia\u201d and \u201ccounselor\u201d \u2014 for which the community\u2019s native dialects have no word.\n\nTraditionally, story cloths are sewn using techniques similar to American quilting \u2014 but Vang can\u2019t sew and so painted hers instead. The video was later shown at a community event. \u201cI heard a lot of people said that it touched them,\u201d Vang said. \u201cOne lady came up and said she was willing to sew it.\u201d\n\nVang\u2019s outreach work is especially important to the Transcultural Wellness Center, because she has herself overcome mental illness. That not only sends an important signal to new Hmong clients, for whom she acts as a \u201cpeer partner\u201d \u2014 but also to the psychiatrists and clinical psychologists who work at the clinic. \u201cI remind the staff that recovery is possible,\u201d Vang said. It was a long journey. Vang\u2019s parents didn\u2019t view depression as a real illness, and denied consent for her to be prescribed medication. So her only option was cognitive-behavioral therapy, which slowly taught her how to replace her negative thoughts with positive ones. She would walk to to the clinic, to avoid the yelling that would ensue if she asked to be driven to her treatment sessions. As she sat down with BuzzFeed News at the Transcultural Wellness Center, Vang recalled what her parents told her at the time: \u201cYou\u2019re such a bad daughter, bringing shame, losing the family reputation.\u201d Stigma affected Vang and her brother in different ways. Because his symptoms of schizophrenia were more obvious, Vang\u2019s brother was allowed to take medication, which helped. But he was excluded from family and community events because of his erratic behavior. Eventually, he had to leave home \u2014 and securing a roof over his head remains a problem to this day. \u201cSometimes he goes homeless,\u201d Vang said. \u201cSometimes I have to feed him.\u201d It took four-and-a-half years for Vang to complete her own recovery. Gaining acceptance from her family has been even harder, but appearing on the health department billboard was a watershed moment. \u201cIt opened the conversation with my family again,\u201d Vang said. \u201cOne of my sisters, she used to stigmatize me so much. But now that she\u2019s seen it, she says, \u2018Wow, you convey the message that you can be happy, even after PTSD.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Transcultural Wellness Clinic has also made inroads into the Hmong community by forming a women\u2019s gardening group. For elder Hmong, it has provided a connection to the agrarian life they once lived in the mountains of Laos. \u201cImagine because of the war, you\u2019re displaced, you live in an apartment. You\u2019re in an identity crisis,\u201d Ton, the medical director, explained. \u201cThe kids don\u2019t see value in Hmong cultural beliefs. You feel you can\u2019t teach them anything. You have to ask them for help when the school sends home paperwork.\u201d \u201cThen you see the garden grow. You bring food home for the children,\u201d Ton continued. \u201cYou feel that the skills you developed continue to grow.\u201d For Ton, helping elder Hmong reconnect with the old life in Laos in this way is every bit as valuable as the medication and psychotherapy his staff can offer. The gardening group took a serious blow in 2013, when its urban farm was vandalized in an apparently racist attack \u2014 swastikas were scrawled at the scene. It was a dark day, but Ton was encouraged by the group\u2019s response to this outrage. Rather than feeling powerless, they came to clinic staff and asked for help in filing a police report in English. \u201cThey\u2019re starting to feel like they\u2019re part of the community,\u201d Ton said. For people who have for decades lived on the margins, wrestling with trauma spanning back for decades, that might be the best measure of healing of all.\n\nTo learn more about depression, PTSD, and schizophrenia, check out the resources at the National Institute of Mental Health here, here, and here.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeter Aldhous is a Science Reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in San Francisco.

The results had all these red markers.\u201d The tests, from an alternative medicine practitioner who was recommended by and paid for by a major charity, apparently showed that Layla\u2019s son, an autistic boy who was 3 at the time, had various issues with his gut and his metabolism. \u201cI was shocked,\u201d says Layla. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise \u2013 my son had all these deficiencies, these toxins in his system.\u201d The tests recommended a gluten-, casein-, and dairy-free diet. \u201cIt didn\u2019t seem like a really big deal,\u201d says Layla. \u201cI thought, gluten, it\u2019s bread and pasta \u2013 it\u2019s not a massive thing.\u201d The practitioner told her to monitor her son\u2019s sleep and behaviour, and to expect improvements in the symptoms of his autism if they followed the diet. But that\u2019s not all she told Layla. \u201cIn the first hour, she told us that there was a lot of science and research that proves that autism is caused by vaccines,\u201d she says. \u201cShe said if the child has lots of bugs as a baby, ear infections, and antibiotics, it crashes their immune system. Vaccinations cause them to regress. MMR [the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine] is the final thing that causes them to regress into autism.\u201d From there, the practitioner tried to lead Layla and her son down a rabbit hole of weirder, more intrusive supposed treatments for autism. \u201cShe asked me to join a forum, a Facebook group,\u201d says Layla. Facebook groups and, in earlier years, internet chat groups have been a vital source of support for parents of autistic children. But they have also been a key recruiting ground for quacks and charlatans, preying on parental desperation. The group Layla joined recommended \u201cbiomedical\u201d treatments \u2013 which included gluten-/casein-free diets, but also supplements, vitamin B12 injections, and, alarmingly, \u201cGcMAF\u201d or \u201cRerum\u201d, a dangerous stem-cell treatment that the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) calls \u201ca significant risk to people\u2019s health\u201d. Her practitioner also mentioned \u201cchelation\u201d \u2013 a potentially dangerous method of using chemicals to remove heavy metals from the bloodstream \u2013 and she was aware of another Facebook group pushing \u201cMineral Miracle Solution\u201d (MMS), a much-hyped cure-all substance that is in fact a form of chlorine-based bleach, often given as an enema. \u201cSome of [the group members] were doing lots of supplements, going to doctors in the US, being told all this stuff, sometimes for a number of years,\u201d says Layla. \u201cIt was overwhelming. It took a while for the penny to drop, but then I realised I couldn\u2019t believe the stuff that was going on. I just started to question it, to question what they were doing.\u201d Layla\u2019s story is not unusual. Pseudoscientific treatments exist for almost all diseases and conditions, but parents of autistic children seem to be disproportionately targeted by quacks and snake-oil peddlers, according to parents and experts spoken to by BuzzFeed News. \u201cThe targeting of parents who have recently diagnosed children is very insistent,\u201d says Sarah-Jayne Garner, a mother of an autistic son and campaigner for autistic rights, who is herself autistic. \u201cIt\u2019s constant. The first thing anyone says to you is \u2018Get them on a gluten-free diet.\u2019 It\u2019s not backed up by any kind of serious science, but parents who are new to autism just don\u2019t have the tools and knowledge to assess what\u2019s being presented to them as solutions to what they\u2019re told are their problems.\u201d There are hundreds of websites and Facebook pages that claim that autism is caused by vaccines, and which promote \u201ccures\u201d \u2013 often substances that can be bought via that website. And the stories they share are often hugely viral.

People gradually disappear into little bubbles \u2013 private email groups, Facebook groups. And then they seek confirmation.\u201d Dr Michael Fitzpatrick, a retired GP whose autistic son is now 25, says he used to see the effects in his clinic. \u201cI\u2019d come across parents who\u2019d been drawn into it to varying degrees,\u201d he says. \u201cI ran a baby clinic, giving immunisations, and all these nervous parents were coming in. I remember vividly one parent bursting into tears, saying she blamed herself, for giving her child the MMR. And others saying \u2018Can I get a prescription for XYZ?\u2019, whatever they\u2019d seen on the internet. Gluten-free diets or whatever.\u201d Discussion around autism can be seen as an early example of the filter bubbles online, where algorithms and content shared by like-minded people mean that many of us unknowingly see only things that reinforce our existing beliefs, leading us towards a polarised view of the world. The rise of social media has made it easy for these bubbles to form in recent years. But for parents of autistic children, it started much earlier \u2013 before Facebook even existed, and years before it reached its current ubiquity. Parents swapped stories via email and message boards, especially a bunch of sites on the Yahoo Health groups that sprang up in the late 1990s and early 2000s. They included places like as Environment of Harm, a Yahoo group set up to discuss \u201cvaccine damage and mercury poisoning and other environmental toxins as it relates to autism\u201d; GFCFKids, \u201ca discussion forum for parents of children on the autism spectrum who are avoiding gluten and casein and other substances in their children\u2019s diets\u201d; Chelatingkids2, \u201cfor parents and/or family members of children with autism who are seeking biomedical intervention\u201d; and Autism-Mercury, focusing on \u201cthe increasing incidence of autism [and] the potential link between excessive mercury exposure via thimerosal in infant vaccines\u201d. At their peak these groups had thousands of users each and thousands of posts a month. These numbers have since dwindled significantly. That is partly, says Fitzpatrick, because the anti-vaccination movement has lost a bit of momentum in the last 10 years \u2013 but it\u2019s also because much of the Yahoo groups\u2019 traffic has since moved to Facebook or the wider internet. In the new groups and sites there are memes that are used to quickly rebuff contradictory ideas. \u201cAnything that goes against it is \u2018tobacco science\u2019,\u201d says Stanton. \u201cIt\u2019s the drug companies financing the studies that tell you vaccines are safe, and of course they can\u2019t be trusted, because that\u2019s what happened with cigarettes.\u201d Jonathan Green, a professor of child and adolescent psychology at the University of Manchester, who specialises in autism research, says it\u2019s \u201coversimplifying\u201d to say that the prevalence of quackery around autism is the fault of the internet, but that there is some truth in the idea. \u201cLike a lot of things currently there\u2019s a culture, amplified by the internet,\u201d he says. \u201cA rebellious, anti-establishment, anti-expert thing around, saying the doctors and establishment don\u2019t get it, it\u2019s all a conspiracy. It\u2019s not specific to autism; it\u2019s even more virulent around chronic fatigue syndrome.\u201d\n\nThe origins of this rebellion against the medical and scientific establishment may be understandable. That establishment\u2019s role in the history of autism has not always been glorious and if any group is entitled to distrust scientists and doctors, it\u2019s the parents of autistic children. Parents have been \u201cblamed\u201d for their children\u2019s autism, which was thought to be psychological or even caused by parental neglect, and disbelieved when they disputed this. Parents had to do the spadework themselves to show that autism is a neurological condition.\n\nThis confusion and misinformation stretched back years. \u201cThe name \u2018autism\u2019, from the Greek \u2018autos\u2019, self, was coined in the early 20th century, to suggest that a person was locked inside themselves,\u201d says Green. \u201cIt\u2019s a misnomer, but it\u2019s stuck.\u201d In the same period, psychoanalyst Bruno Bettelheim was a key figure in promoting a hugely destructive image of autism: the so-called \u201crefrigerator mother theory\u201d. The idea was that parents of autistic sons and daughters were often cold and unemotional towards their children. \u201cInstead of thinking, Emotionally remote parent has emotionally remote child. Hmm. Genetics? Could be!, they went down the wrong path,\u201d Stanton says. \u201cBettelheim was particularly obnoxious about it. He talked about \u2018parentectomies\u2019, removing the parent from the child.\u201d Bettelheim was later revealed to be a fraud, using invented data and treating patients who were not in fact autistic, then claiming to have \u201ccured\u201d them of autism. But his ideas left a lasting impact, and a distrust of science around autism. \u201cParents had to battle against this,\u201d says Stanton. \u201cThey had to become \u2018warrior parents\u2019, to do their own research, to take on the science and argue that \u2018No, our children are not disturbed.\u2019 \u201cAnd it created a mindset. A psychiatrist told me once: \u2018We told them it was refrigerator mothers, and the parents proved us wrong. Now we\u2019re saying that vaccines don\u2019t cause autism, and they\u2019re determined to prove us wrong again.\u2019\u201d In an example of how complex this history has been, one of the very people who helped to overturn the refrigerator mother theory, Bernie Rimland, became an anti-vaccine advocate. Rimland was an American psychologist and father of an autistic boy, Mike. His 1964 book, Infantile Autism: The Syndrome and Its Implications for a Neural Theory of Behavior, was instrumental in moving mainstream science to treating autism as a physical, neurological condition. But having forced scientific thinking off one false path, he started down another. \u201cAfter he\u2019d disposed of refrigerator mother theory, he started looking for biological markers,\u201d says Stanton. \u201cHe got hooked into things like gluten-casein intolerances, or special diets and megadoses of vitamins to cure autism.\u201d And, perhaps most damagingly of all, he started believing that autism was linked to vaccines. \u201cThere\u2019d been an anti-vaccine movement in the US for a long time,\u201d says Stanton. \u201cThey latched on to the warrior parents, and persuaded at least some of them that scientists had always been wrong about autism, and that they were wrong now.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, Rimland thought that it was linked to thimerosal, a mercury-containing preservative used in some vaccines. Thimerosal is not and was never used in the MMR vaccine, but that didn\u2019t matter. When the now-disgraced British gastroenterologist Andrew Wakefield\u2019s \u201cfraudulent\u201d 1998 paper was published, falsely linking MMR to autism, Rimland appeared to endorse the fears it raised. Emails apparently from Rimland, published by an anti-vaccine campaigner on the site Age of Autism, link both thimerosal-based vaccines and MMR to autism. \u201cThese two vaccine scares are contradictory,\u201d says Fitzpatrick, but it didn\u2019t matter. Rimland\u2019s conversion appears to have been, at least in part, driven by the early Yahoo chatrooms. According to Age of Autism, a post on one of these groups helped bring him into the anti-vaccination camp. Rimland gave the vaccine conspiracy, and biomedical approaches to autism, a major boost, especially in the United States. \u201cHe was a charismatic figure, one of the founding parents of the US autistic community,\u201d Fitzpatrick says. \u201cWhen he endorsed the vaccine stuff, promoted all sorts of treatments, because of his status in challenging the refrigerator mother theory it had quite an influence.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe prevalence of unevidenced stories about autism, and parents\u2019 vulnerability to them, can also be explained by the nature of the condition itself. A diagnosis often hits parents without warning, and leaves them desperate for some control over their children\u2019s lives and their own. That combination can leave parents looking for answers, and looking for solutions, that mainstream medicine is unable to offer.\n\n\u201cOne of the curious features about autism is the way it develops,\u201d says Fitzpatrick. \u201cMost autistic children seem to develop perfectly normally until about 15 or 18 months of age. \u201cThat insidious nature lends itself to speculative theories about what causes it and how you might treat it.\u201d Children get several jabs around this age, making the visible onset of autism easy to link to vaccines. More than that, it can be a profoundly difficult condition for parents. \u201cIt\u2019s a very profound and intriguing disability, in the sense of how it impacts on very basic social capacities,\u201d says Green. Other neurological and mental conditions are more \u201cunderstandable\u201d to neurotypical parents: \u201cIf you imagine a kid with ADHD,\u201d says Green, \u201cthey\u2019re impulsive, they get into trouble, they have short attention spans.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not downplaying ADHD, but the way autism affects social capacity is at a different level. It affects parents profoundly, and raises questions of \u2018Why on earth this is happening?\u2019 \u2013 it leaves people speculating, in a vacuum.\u201d\n\nAnd what makes parents more desperate, says Fitzpatrick, is that they often feel like they have no way of helping their child at all. \u201cIf you bring your autistic child to your GP and say you\u2019ve got a problem, the GP will say \u2018We don\u2019t know what causes it and we can\u2019t treat it.\u2019 That\u2019s very hard to live with,\u201d says Fitzpatrick. \u201cSo if someone comes up to you and says \u2018Your GP is useless. I know what causes it,\u2019 or \u2018take these tablets\u2019, or \u2018swim with dolphins\u2019, or whatever, then at least you\u2019ve got something.\u201d He thinks that\u2019s why dietary plans are so popular among parents of autistic children. \u201cIt gives you a feeling of control, and that\u2019s exactly what the child denies you, because they\u2019re so difficult to manage,\u201d he says. \u201cThe one thing about having an autistic child is that you feel so impotent. Nothing seems to work; doing anything ordinary is so difficult. \u201cAt least you can say \u2018I\u2019ll follow this diet, avoid these foods, have these foods, give these supplements.\u2019 It\u2019s very specific. It\u2019s a programme that involves a lot of parental effort, and parents welcome that.\u201d A complicating factor in all of this is that autism is heritable \u2013 an autistic child is quite likely to have autistic parents. \u201cThis is generalising massively, but when autistic people find a problem, they try to fix it,\u201d says Garner. \u201cIt\u2019s how we\u2019re wired, it\u2019s one of our strengths. \u201cBut when you\u2019re told your child isn\u2019t going to develop according to the norms and they\u2019ll suffer and struggle, you desperately look around for any solutions.\u201d Parents who struggled socially at school themselves \u2013 and especially those who haven\u2019t yet realised that they are autistic \u2013 \u201ccan become terrified when our children don\u2019t behave in ways that are accepted by other parents, at parties or in the playground,\u201d she says. The situation isn\u2019t helped, Garner says, by an obsessive focus in the education system on milestones. \u201cI\u2019m an English teacher,\u201d she says. \u201cAny teacher will tell you that there\u2019s a ridiculous focus on children meeting externally prescribed markers, so that school budgets are maintained and teachers are rewarded. Autistic children will fall outside those markers, often substantially. So the education system fails our autistic kids, and isolates them, and creates that terror and fear.\u201d Any scared parent would be vulnerable to charlatans selling quick fixes for their children\u2019s problems, but it\u2019s even more the case for autistic parents, says Garner. \u201cWe can be articulate, but we are vulnerable, we have social deficits, so we are rich pickings,\u201d she says. \u201cRich\u201d is the word. The industries that have sprung up around so-called autism cures are lucrative \u2013 another reason why people have swooped in to take advantage of parents\u2019 desperation. \u201cA lot of it is market incentives,\u201d says Green. In 2015, 10,000 vials of GcMAF were seized by the MHRA from a site in Cambridgeshire. AutismCD has 8,600 members; the website that sells MMS itself claims to have treated 75,000 people for several conditions (not just autism) in Africa alone. Dozens of books offering dietary and medical \u201ccures\u201d for autism are available on Amazon. Garner told BuzzFeed News that people she knew had been offered autism-treating foot baths at \u00a32,600 a go. The mother in the Yahoo groups infiltrated by Left Brain Right Brain in the early 2000s was spending around $3,000 (\u00a32,300) a month on her child\u2019s treatments, to no effect.\n\nAnd most important of all, there are devastating, human consequences when autistic people are subjected to these treatments, which are often intrusive or even dangerous, and have no good scientific evidence for benefit. One autistic woman, who wished to remain anonymous for fear of online retribution from anti-vaccination campaigners and would only speak to BuzzFeed News via an intermediary, said that she had been subjected to cold baths \u2013 a procedure known as \u201cpacking\u201d \u2013 and bleach enemas. \u201cSome enemas were with castor oil and diluted bleach,\u201d she said. \u201cBleach burns, and has a pungent odour. The enemas were once a week and I would run to get away as I couldn\u2019t tolerate it. They\u2019d hold me down. The enemas were very painful and had awful stuff that hurt. It made you shit a metre of poo.\u201d\n\nShe was also forced to eat MMS: \u201cMy foster parents used to soak my food in it. They said it was to purify my insides.\u201d Her experience is not uncommon: Garner says that she knows practitioners who offer MMS or chlorine dioxide enemas for their children. She told BuzzFeed News that being told she needed to be cured made her feel \u201cawful \u2013 like I\u2019m somehow not worthy or good enough to be treated as equal by so-called \u2018normals\u2019.\u201d The message that this gives the wider autistic community is psychologically painful as well \u2013 they are being told that they are \u201cdamaged\u201d, a claim that an increasingly large number of autistic people reject. \u201cThere's this big movement, especially among the more able, to say \u2018I'm not a damaged neurotypical, I'm a functioning autistic person,\u2019\u201d says Stanton. \u201cIt\u2019s a movement away from seeing autism as a pathology. There\u2019s a whole world out there of people arguing for autism acceptance, that autistic people have value and aren\u2019t just damaged goods.\u201d Garner agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we don\u2019t see autism as a disability,\u201d she says. \u201cThe community is very honest about the fact that we\u2019re disabled. But we don\u2019t need our children being prescribed bleach enemas.\u201d\n\nStanton says that while autism brings with it real problems, autistic people see it as part of them. That\u2019s why, he says, the community rejects the \u201cperson-first language\u201d that is often preferred when talking about people with disabilities: \u201c\u2018I'm not a person with autism, my autism is part of who I am, it helps to define me, I am autistic,\u2019\u201d he says. He tells a story he heard from a professor: \u201cA young autistic man came into his lab, and the professor asked: \u2018If there was a pill for autism, would you take it?\u2019 And the young man said \u2018I\u2019d take half the pill.\u2019\u201d BuzzFeed News spoke to Fiona O\u2019Leary, an autistic woman and anti-pseudoscience campaigner who has five children, two of whom are autistic. She agrees that the suggestion that she and her children were \u201cdamaged\u201d was enormously painful. \u201cIt hurts us a lot personally,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel outraged, and I fear for the autistic community. I don\u2019t think that people see us as worthwhile. \u201cMy son is 13, he\u2019s autistic, and he\u2019s able to read this stuff. He\u2019s scared. It\u2019s making unnecessary mental health issues for people, adding to the challenges we have \u2013 and we do have challenges. The quacks are waging a war on us.\u201d She says that the rhetoric around the biomedical and anti-vaccine movements makes it sound like \u201cautism will come in the night and change your child in the crib. It hurts when people say these things about your child, and it hurts him too. People don\u2019t think autistic children are aware, but they are. Every day you get a new scar.\u201d Recently there have been real breakthroughs, scientifically informed breakthroughs, in improving the lives of autistic children and their parents without attempting to \u201cremove\u201d the autism. Green has been involved in the Pre-school Autism Communication Trial, which teaches parents effective ways of interacting with their autistic children, and which has seen significant reductions, persisting for several years, in the severity of some of the more negative symptoms of the condition. \u201cThe basic idea is that it\u2019s altering the social learning environment of the child, and we do that through using the parents as co-therapists,\u201d he says. \u201cNot saying there\u2019s something wrong with the parenting. It was amazingly effective. It doesn\u2019t cure autism, but it helps things get better.\u201d He says there may in future be effective biological treatments as well, and the two would be used together. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely that there will be any miracles,\u201d he says, \u201cbut over time, it could be fairly transformative.\u201d But after all this troubled history, the tide of quackery may be ebbing \u2013 at least in Britain. Andrew Wakefield himself has moved to Texas with several other British anti-vaccination campaigners, including the Autism Trust\u2019s Polly Tommey. Internet groups are much less active than they were before: \u201cIf you see the JABS forum [a prominent anti-vaccine group], it\u2019s treading water compared to 10 years ago. Tommey couldn\u2019t get much traction here so she went to the States. Lots of the clinics are just operating out of someone\u2019s back room.\u201d That\u2019s partly, says Garner, because more information is becoming available. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lack of good info for parents,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we\u2019re now starting to see things like non-speaking autistic people writing about their experiences of the treatments of these quacks. It\u2019s still quite new, and their voices haven\u2019t been amplified in the way that those of the wealthy groups supporting \u2018cures\u2019 have.\u201d But it\u2019s a start, she says. Layla\u2019s son is now 6. After those first few weeks three years ago, he didn\u2019t undergo any more biomedical treatments. \u201cI go to a lot of parent meetings, coffee mornings with parents of autistic children,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think they really know about all this stuff that\u2019s going on on the internet. It\u2019s still going on underground. \u201cMy son goes to a special school. I speak to a lot of parents, a lot of staff, and I don\u2019t know any kids there on a gluten-free diet. He\u2019s doing really well now.\u201d Additional reporting by Tom Phillips\n\nOutside Your Bubble is a BuzzFeed News effort to bring you a diversity of thought and opinion from around the internet.

Here's what they said: 01. It's common to struggle with mental health at Uni, even if you never have before. \"As someone who had never experienced mental health in my life, it was such a shock when I suddenly had depression. I wish I\u2019d known how likely it was to happen. The sheer amount of people it affects while at Uni is insane. I wish I was more aware of it prior to it hitting me with full force.\" \u2013billieh4c2f03c05 02. Uni is a chance to get to know yourself better, and that includes getting familiar with the state of your mental health. \"For me, Uni was the time when I discovered what was really going on with me. My friend took me to see the student support team, and it allowed me to open up about everything, to go on to be referred to specialists, get a diagnosis and finally get help. I'm not 100%, and never will be, but it was relieving knowing that I had support and that I could begin to understand myself in a safe way, even during those stressful years.\" \u2013Anonymous\n\n\n\n03. Know the signs of depression and other mental illnesses. \"After failing my workload again and again I dropped out thinking I was just too lazy, I realised I was in the middle of a depressive episode.\" \u2013arewedoneyet 04. Take advantage of the help available. \"It is important to seek help if you aren't feeling right, and there are often more resources for mental health whilst you're at Uni than when you leave so use them if you can.\" \u2013Anonymous\n\nAdvertisement\n\n05. Reach out for help early. \"I have severe and complex mental health issues; by not reaching out things were allowed to escalate. I would advise make use of the uni support systems, your GP and those around you. No one is expecting you to have it together yet. In fact there\u2019s no shame in admitting you can\u2019t cope\". \u2013amyy4e1823486\n\n06. Starting uni is just really hard, and it's OK to be honest about that. \"I wish someone had said that the first few weeks of uni are actually really, really hard, whether you have mental illness or not (but especially if you do). Everyone talks about how incredible Fresher\u2019s Week is, but if you have social anxiety and you don\u2019t know anyone there, you\u2019ll be plunged into the socially anxious person\u2019s wort nightmare. But you\u2019d be amazed how many people, when you actually take the time to ask, are just as terrified as you are. Everyone finds it challenging, and there is SO MUCH help available, you just have to take it into your own hands and be brave enough to ask for it.\" \u2013meganmcg998\n\n\n\n07. It's essential to keep an eye on your stress levels. \"Do not leave it to the point where your only sleep is when you physically crash! I was lucky; I got physically frog-marched to the Uni doctor by my friends before I really started to seriously harm myself.\" \u2013surikune\n\n08. It's OK to accept help, even if it's not in the places that you thought you'd find it. \"I made use of advice and counselling and student support in my faculty while going through depression at uni, but one of the best people I told was my manager at my student job. It was important to tell him because my behaviour was erratic, but he actually ended up being a huge part in my recovery. He helped me focus on the small victories (literally as small as pouring a good pint or making a customer laugh) and helped rebuild my confidence outside of academic grades.\" \u2013Anonymous\n\n09. Know how the system works. \"When you arrive at uni, even though you may not feel like you're struggling yet, go straight to the student support services, explain your situation, ask what support is available and say \"can I fill in the forms for mitigating circumstances and DSA (Disabled Students Allowance) now, and if I feel I need them at a later date they're there\". These things can take time, and you don't always realise you need them until it's too late.\" \u2013Anonymous\n\n10. Know what your Uni offers in terms of mental health resources. \"Years after a silent struggle with depression in Uni, I went to my Uni\u2019s website to look what might have been available to me then \u2013 and there was pretty much nothing! No counseling, no \u2018we\u2019ll help you find help\u2019. Nothing. So future students: Look out for things like that before you choose a Uni, even if you think you won\u2019t need it!\" \u2013arewedoneyet\n\n11. Don't go it alone. \"The pressures of university can be huge. I wish I\u2019d known it was OK to ask for help. I also wish I\u2019d known how to tell my friends what I was going through. Instead I pushed them away when I needed them most.\" \u2013rosamundm\n\n12. It's OK to go at your own pace. \"I wish I had people who could have told me beforehand that it might not live up to your expectations. That you could have a bad time and it wouldn\u2019t be the end of the world if you changed your mind, took some time for yourself and gone back when you\u2019re truly ready to face the demands of a degree.\" \u2013rockyy\n\n13. There are safety nets for when things get bad. \"A mental break does not equate to an automatic fail. Mitigating Evidence is just one of your safety nets; this allows for the re-taking of parts/years of degrees without consequence.\" \u2013surikune\n\n14. Keep trying, and be kind to yourself. \"This is the most important and a big life lesson for living away from home in general. Keep going, you can do it! Uni will still be there tomorrow and after an hour's distraction and self care you may feel more able to handle the world. If you need medication, that's OK. The days it doesn't work out and don't go the way you expected are fine, so long as you want to make tomorrow, next week, next year better. Mental health is a marathon, not a sprint.\" \u2013Anonymous\n\n15. Don't be ashamed of what's going on with you. \"I got diagnosed with depression halfway through my second year at Uni. Feeling able to talk about it and removing the stigma have been really helpful for me. Once I realised that I shouldn't be ashamed of what I was going through, I felt like I could acknowledge and confront it. I spent ages too embarrassed to admit there was something wrong and being unwilling to tell any of my friends that I wasn't OK. Probably could have coped a lot better if I'd admitted I wasn't OK.\" \u2013Anonymous 16. Give yourself a chance. \"My first year of university did not go well. I am very lucky and I come from an incredibly loving family so when it came to leave them and move out on my own, my incredibly high expectations were not met. I expected the people I met to be like minded and enthusiastic (basically clones of people I\u2019d gone to school with). I found it so difficult to interact and to fit in; I was depressed and I was self-harming almost daily. Eventually I sought help, randomly passing a MIND van that visits once a term. I picked up a leaflet, as nonchalantly as I could. I went back to my room and forgot about it. It wasn\u2019t until weeks later that seeing the leaflet actually woke me up. I thought about what I was doing, I stopped what I was about to do and read. That changed my life. I will always have the ugly scars to remind me of this time, but I\u2019ve also kept the leaflet. Mental health services at universities are essential. I dread to think what I would have done had I not stopped by the MIND van, but I know I would not have consulted my doctor, sought counselling and I would not be making a recovery now.\" \u2013annieelizabethm4ab72576b\n\n\n\n17. And seriously, talk to people about what's going on with you. \"Trusted friends, co-workers, bosses, lecturers, essentially anyone you feel safe with. Even if it's just so people are aware that you may cry at the smallest of things, not want to go to all the parties, and sometimes just be alone in your room watching Netflix. And sometimes just admitting that something is wrong can work wonders to helping you start your own recovery.\" \u2013Anonymous\n\n\n\nContributions have been edited for length and clarity.

And all too often, they are neither obvious nor visible in presentation. All too often, they are stigmatized, or silenced altogether. As a writer, performer, and body empowerment advocate, I have spent much of my life sharing my eating-disorder survival story. And still, it feels impossible to perfectly articulate the deadly mental illness that is an eating disorder, as the journey of survival is uniquely personal. We heard from a diverse array of individuals worldwide who have experienced various eating disorders and experiences with body image, who describe their survival in myriad ways. Here are some of the many stories we received. \u2014Caroline Rothstein\n\nAs a 12-year-old with full-blown anorexia, I was involuntarily institutionalized after having an eating disorder\u2013induced seizure. The institution was not equipped to deal with eating disorders, and their only plan of action was to watch me eat, shower, and sleep to ensure I didn\u2019t throw up, exercise, or throw my food away. I was treated less as a medical patient and more like a criminal, unable to privately mourn the loss of my innocence and adolescence. This was my first insight into how our health care system is unprepared to treat eating disorder survivors, a travesty compounded by society\u2019s rigid physical ideals for women. Survivors could best be served by the development of new treatment options targeted at modifying harmful behaviors and by eroding patriarchal visions of the female body. Instead, we are treated like social outliers who are shamed and told we have taken things too far. Denying the existence of sexism is a historically convenient method of the ignorant, and to tell an eating disorder survivor that our plight is of self-creation is to validate the disproportionate and unrealistic physical expectations for women that have permeated every aspect of society. I will never forget the first time I saw my own reflection without wanting to see less of it. It took years for me to regain control of my life and body, both of which deserved respect and love after having spent years as a battleground. Sharing my story was the first step toward total recovery and remains my personal form of resistance. By speaking out, we can reduce the shame and stigma associated with eating disorders and give courage to millions of survivors. \u2014Jaclyn Munson\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy story begins at age 4. I was extremely underweight for my height and age; however, my grandmother told I had \u201carms like ham\u201d and was \u201cgetting chubby.\u201d I spent my entire childhood surrounded by weight stigma \u2014 whether it was from my grandmother constantly telling me to \u201cgo on a diet\u201d or comparing my own body to my friends'. At 12, I went on what I described as a \u201cvery strict diet.\u201d I had no clue what anorexia was. I thought it was when someone literally never ate anything due to some underlying emotional problem, when, in reality, accordingly to my personal understanding and experience, it\u2019s a disease that manifests in the mind; an utter fear of weight gain. It does not have a specific physical appearance. It does not pick particular races or genders. It just is. My \u201cdiet\u201d left me with a failing liver, a problematic heart, hair loss, and osteopenia. I went into treatment for anorexia and fully came to terms with my disease, and began to believe that I did not choose this. Anorexia was like a light switch that lived inside my brain, turned off for most of my life. The stigma surrounding my weight is what turned it on. For me, I will never turn my anorexia off. It\u2019s always going to be a struggle. I can, however, dim the lights. Now, at 16, I remain recovered without relapse. Although every day I see girls in magazines and in person with tiny waists, I am fighting. I am alive. I almost lost my life, and my life is much more important than my weight. Someday, I think I will 100% believe I am beautiful, and I will do that on my own terms, without the help of a boy or Instagram likes. Until then, I remain a 16-year-old girl still surrounded by weight stigma and slowly, but surely, learning to be comfortable with myself. \u2014Meg Masseron\n\nMy eating disorder was a unicorn in shape. I was never terrified of certain foods. I never truly thought I was fat. While I didn\u2019t use my mathematically inclined mind to count calories, I used it to balance an equation in my head: an equation of worth. Growing up, food was taken away when I was bad. In my mind, I equated it to not being worth food at all. I took that mind-set to college, with a bit of freedom, resulting in a streak of bingeing. Each episode left me with this feeling of worthlessness. One might say it contributed to my leaving college after a violent sexual assault campus police refused to do anything about left me feeling even more worthless. But I was worth the physical demands of the military. I was worth the possibility of dying. During my time in the Air Force, I was told repeatedly that I was nothing. Things I recited to myself for years were now coming out of the lips of those in charge of me. If there was any doubt I didn\u2019t deserve to be alive, let alone eat, it was eradicated. Ultimately, I was kicked out for having an eating disorder, deemed unable to deploy and unfit for service. As a parting gift, the military paid for my first treatment stint. A couple of years passed before I needed treatment again, this time due to a severe heart problem from malnourishment. I have never been so humbled and humiliated as those days I had to go into work with a feeding tube. I think I needed that. I couldn\u2019t hide the fact I had an eating disorder by lying or saying I had a fast metabolism. I had something sticking out of my nose that couldn\u2019t be ignored. After six months in treatment and the best psychiatrist I have ever had, I have been weight restored and behavior-free for two years. I have found balance. I have found that you assign your own worth. By assigning your own worth, you afford and deny yourself opportunities. So set that worth high. Happiness is not a destination, it\u2019s moments. You won\u2019t get moments of happiness if you feel worthless, because you won\u2019t believe you deserve them. I want you to know: You deserve them. \u2014K.F.\n\nWhen I was in college, I developed a binge-eating disorder. As a transgender man, my body already caused me a great deal of discomfort and emotional pain, and it seemed almost natural to take my stress and anxiety out on my physical self. The summer after freshman year of college, I was living at home, binge-eating most nights. In my mind, I was weak; I didn\u2019t have the discipline to restrict eating, and I was running to try to counteract the eating. Almost a year later, back at college, I woke up and couldn\u2019t make myself eat. I just sat staring at my kitchen, crying. The Emily Program in St. Paul, Minnesota, might be the greatest place in the world to learn how to save your own life. My therapist and nutritionist were patient, constantly morphing a treatment plan to fit where I was at. They helped me understand binge eating, and gave me the strength to identify my bingeing as a disorder, not a weakness, and work to relearn healthy habits. While in recovery, a teacher/mentor suggested I take steps to look into hormone therapy, that maybe making such positive changes might help me have a healthier relationship with my body. I\u2019ve been on testosterone injections for two years and can honestly say testosterone is the reason I\u2019ll never have an eating disorder again. Putting such positive and affirming energy into my body and into making slow and steady changes to how I see myself pushes me to take care of myself in every aspect of life. I no longer see my body as something to fight against. I no longer see food as a weapon or as a punishment. Sometimes, when I am anxious or sad or stressed, I find myself getting a small urge to binge, but now I know I can trust myself to take care of myself. When I look at myself now, I notice how I finally have a beard growing in, or how my face is sharpening and my hips are narrowing to a more masculine shape. I don\u2019t see a weak binger or someone who is nothing but an eating disorder they\u2019ll never crawl out of. For the first time in my life, without any second thought, I see someone strong who has survived and thrived. I see someone who has taken control of themselves and their body in a healthy, positive way. I see me. \u2014Miles Walser\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was no real moment when my recovery began. Where I said, \u201cI\u2019ve decided to get better\u201d or could magically shut off the voice in my head. Simply facing the possibility of recovery was a long process in itself, like a flower sitting in the cold of winter and painfully turning toward the sun. Done so carefully, in fact, it doesn\u2019t even register the movement. But there was a moment when I felt things shift; I was sprawled out in my college dorm room, workout clothes on, reprimanding myself with the typical shoulds and shouldn\u2019ts, when a part of my mind or body or soul that I didn\u2019t know still existed burst bright and asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d I didn\u2019t have an answer, but my eating disorder had plenty. All the answers I knew so well. The ones that haunted me in my sleep and stole me from the day. The answers that had driven me to destroy myself for years. Somehow, though, while my mind continued relentlessly, I realized my answer didn\u2019t matter just yet because the question itself was strong enough. The place from where it came inside me was strong enough. When I started my recovery, I had lost so much of who I was that, in order to find myself again, I had to start with what I knew: I love the sound of rain through an open window, I love my dog\u2019s sweet kisses, I love how the sun looks in winter. In the beginning, that I was all I could recall, but the more I recovered, the more I remembered. What was even more exciting were the things I started to learn about myself for the first time. And even though they might look minuscule \u2014 like why I dance while making dinner, why I laugh so loud, why I asked \u201cWhy?\u201d that day \u2014 I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re the only things that really add up in the end. \u2014S.E. Carson\n\nIt was the mid-'60s, the Sexual Revolution was gaining traction, freedom was all around, and Twiggy hit the world stage, revered for her gaunt, skinny look. Suddenly, \u201cthin was in,\u201d and I was an anomaly in a family of tall and rail-thin or short and petite; I was just an ordinary child in an ordinary body. I am a survivor. I have more early memories of my eating disorder than I do of my siblings and family and school. At no point during the more than four decades following my initial hospitalization at age 6 was I able to get properly diagnosed and treated for my eating disorder, despite numerous attempts and cries for help on my part. This was my survivorship, to continue to excel until a major occupational fall from grace in my late forties found me in the treatment system \u2014 a system designed for teens and young women that did not want to hear how my older adult struggles and needs were different. Now I am a survivor of the \u201ctreatment\u201d system, a graduate of inpatient admissions where I learned new methods of self-destruction and hatred, where I was never skinny enough, sick enough, needy enough. I have become an \u201cuntouchable,\u201d whose needs exceed the capacity of treatment services, so they offer next to nothing. I am back in a race to the bottom, wondering, perhaps if I get sick enough, will they try to help me again? \u2014Sally Chaster\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGrowing up in a Jamaican-American household, food was an integral part of my childhood. I remember my grandmother preparing fried dumplings and plantains, church hymns playing in the background. Food was our greatest treasure. Food brought the family together. Food celebrated new beginnings and eased the wounds of life\u2019s untimely endings. When I was 8, I was diagnosed with dermatomyositis, a muscle disease that caused me to spend most of my childhood in hospital rooms and wheelchairs, slowly gaining weight whilst swallowing prednisone hidden inside mint chocolate chip ice cream. My mom made it her duty to help me lose the weight through fad dieting. I\u2019ve tried every single one. In fairness, my mother did the best she could. As a single mom, she felt the camaraderie of these shared diets brought us closer. However, as an adult, I began to experience a paralyzing fear of food. My \u201cI\u2019ll start a new diet on Monday\u201d mind-set lasted for 16 years as I compulsively ate and deprived my body. I was worried that I was not attractive enough. So obsessed and afraid no one would hire me as an actor if I didn\u2019t win the battle with the numbers on the scale, in February 2011 I attempted suicide and landed in the hospital for multiple days. We do extreme things to our bodies because of those numbers. Numbers that cannot talk with us or love us. On March 20, 2014, I threw my scale in the trash, and to ensure I wouldn\u2019t rescue it, I threw chicken stock on it. I have had to practice looking in the mirror and telling myself I am beautiful. I have had to stop judging my belly, stop starving myself, stop getting on the scale and staring at those numbers. It took me years to find the courage to stop pressuring my body. Food is still an integral part of my life, and I still struggle to this day after living a life of \u201cquick fixes.\u201d But, I have come to the realization that my life is more important than those numbers on the scale and that the quality of the life I live is more important than how I look in the mirror. \u2014Danielle Pinnock\n\nIf the hardest part is recognizing you have a problem, exercise addiction is the hardest problem to recognize. Only when mine descended into an eating disorder did I become fully aware of the power and control this condition had over my life and me. We are bombarded with health and fitness in the media to such an extent that even the most intense, devoted training programs seem acceptable and normal. Even whilst running and weight lifting far more than any man ever should, it wasn\u2019t until my weight started to dip alarmingly that anyone around me recognized I had a dual battle on my hands: exercise addiction and anorexia. My story with this battle began with a lifelong fight against anxiety and depression. As someone who, excuse the pun, tends to run away from his problems, jogging and the gym became a sanctuary away from the intrusive thoughts, anxieties, and low moods. It was my buffer against the world. As the world became a scarier place, I felt the need to continually strengthen that buffer. No doctor or psychologist would explicitly tell me to stop exercising so much; they were conditioned to believe in the ample mental health benefits of it, even at my extreme end. By the time I decided I needed to take time off, my body was broken. I cried as I ran, hating myself for putting my body through hell. Unfortunately, that\u2019s when the eating disorder took over. If I wasn\u2019t exercising, I wasn\u2019t allowed to eat. I\u2019d never experienced such a strong force in my life, and I gave in to it, allowing it to control everything I did, thought, and said. My life turned around when I was threatened multiple times with inpatient treatment. However, my recovery has been hard-fought. I never lost that eating disorder voice, and it still screams to this day. What has helped most is recognizing life is made up of an infinite number of choices, whether we make them consciously or subconsciously. Eating is one such choice. By recognizing I had control over these choices, I was able to modify my eating and behaviors around exercise so I regained control of my body and life. Every meal, I choose to eat and eat well. If I have to do this for the rest of my life, so be it. Recovery is not an easy path, but it is the right one, and the one that takes the most strength to walk down. \u2014Ben Carter\n\nMy eating disorder was an evil, manipulative \u201cfriend.\u201d One of those mean-girl characters you see from afar kicking others when they\u2019re down. You think, Oh man, thank god that chick\u2019s not in my life \u2014 and then all of a sudden you\u2019re holding her bag and buying her lunch and chasing her to hang out. She makes fun of you, tells you you\u2019re worthless. Makes you cry and gets everyone to hate you. But you keep going back. Again and again. You know she\u2019s toxic and ruining your life, but you\u2019ve given her the reins. The first time I binged I was 7, and for a brief moment nothing else mattered. It made me numb and full and empty and outside of myself all at the same time. I had just been through multiple traumas, and that feeling was all I wanted. For the next 14 years, I chased the dragon. Into pre-diabetes and sleep apnea. Into being unable to fasten the seatbelt in my car. Into two suicide attempts and five hospitals. I chased it until I built my guard up so much I never had to worry about relationships, responsibility, or sex. I chased it until my friends left and my parents sought therapy. I chased it until it became my chosen identity, until the real me was so hidden I had no idea who she was. One of the many things people don\u2019t get about an eating disorder is that it takes on a life of its own. It\u2019s bigger than anything you\u2019ve ever seen. Bigger than you, your family, and the things you love. It has nothing to do with food. It is an illness, a disease, an addiction. A way to gain and lose control. To fill a void, mask a pain, punish, self-harm. Despite all of the darkness, it also gave me a gift. It gave me recovery and the ability to be forced into learning how to love myself. It was survival for me to learn that I\u2019m worthy. That I deserve to see how beautiful I am. That I deserve to let other people see it as well. My recovery allowed me to see how strong and amazing I am, and I\u2019m forever grateful for my disorder. She was a mean bitch who kicked me around, but I stood up to her and gave her a hug and let her know everything was going to be OK. Like all mean girls, she just needed to know she was loved. \u2014Sara Romeo-White\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor decades I kept my eating disorder a secret. I felt ashamed of the anorexia I developed at 11. The secret was like a bully in my mind. I envied anyone who could eat lunch and not feel guilty about it. I will never forget the awfulness of wanting to be like others, to be carefree, instead of caught in a vicious cycle with the eating disorder, not knowing which way is out. I waited many years, until I was 55 and feeling recovered and strong within my sense of self, before publicly sharing my story. Throughout my journalism career of more than three decades, I did not disclose my illness to employers, because I wanted to be considered \"normal,\" even though I was functioning on 5% of my brain at times. I also feared discrimination for disclosing a mental illness. Unlike other serious illnesses that are considered acceptable, an eating disorder continues to face stigmatizing put-downs. Secrecy can seem the easier option. But the cost of trying to keep the illness hidden is that the illness is not dealt with fully and has permanent residence in the brain. To remove the stigma that causes much silent suffering, we need more people who have recovered to stand up and show this illness and the community at large that we are perfectly able to recover and live full and rewarding lives. Recovery from an eating disorder requires a lot of courage; and for best results, to maintain recovery, it requires openness and acceptance in a village of people who understand and who care. We hear a lot of stories about people who are suffering, anorexia in particular. To counter this we need more people who have recovered, not only from anorexia but from all eating disorders, to share stories of life beyond the illness. By showing they are celebrating life deeply and meaningfully, people who have recovered can inspire and offer empathy and support in a way that those without experience of the illness may never know. Eating disorders need to be acknowledged openly. This is the best way to reduce their impact, the stigma, fear, loneliness, and isolation. \u2014June Alexander\n\nThe hardest part about having had an eating disorder was not knowing I had one. As a man and a person of color, I never had the space to be vulnerable and acknowledge my problem. The first thing you think with eating disorders is \u201cwhite woman with body-image issues.\u201d As a late teen, all I saw were Cosmo covers outside of my community and friends experiencing this issue. I struggled with eating, thinking, I\u2019m not bad\u2026 I\u2019m just skipping breakfast and maybe lunch. Plus, minority communities weren\u2019t pushing kale chips, affordable vitamins, and chia-seed drinks. I grew up with quarter-water juices, microwaveable chicken nuggets, and mom\u2019s \u201cclean your plate\u201d mantra with her heavy-handed servings and large decorative plates. I was chubby in childhood \u2014 the side effects of asthma medicines that lasted well after I grew out of severe asthma. My mom called me \u201chusky,\u201d just so I wouldn\u2019t think I was fat. I wanted to be normal, but nothing about looking in the mirror and suffering from depression is normal. I only now realize I was in denial, as I started taking it out on my body from 17 to 22. College didn\u2019t help, but somehow I took control. I did that alone and I\u2019m lucky. I wish we privileged the safety in masculinity to speak about this stuff, especially in communities of color and neighborhoods where healthy diets are a Catch-22. It\u2019s in no way a privilege to have gone through this as a man. My masculinity is and was constantly challenged by other men to have more bravado or by what women want or expect a man to be. If anything, being a black man makes the isolation worse. It creates a silence that many men haven\u2019t been able to emotionally maneuver. Manhood is often toted as something you need to prove. So men who have felt denied emotional vulnerability try to prove that they are actually hurting, perhaps masked by projecting, drugs or drinking, and being miserably violent to themselves and others. People think it\u2019s failing to achieve \u201cbeach body\u201d that affects men in this way. But many roads to depression are brushed off: Be a man; be silent. I still suffer from being through all that in silence. Being intentional on not eating alone or rewarding myself with particular types of food is how I started to challenge feeling alone in the mental fight. I realized the disorder went hand in hand with other issues. Ultimately, feeling comfortable with giving my all to fight the habits and healthily respond to obstacles \u2014 even something as simple as meditating prayer \u2014 is what brought me through. \u2014D.K. Wright\n\nI\u2019ve always felt like a fraudulent bulimic. Like I wasn\u2019t sick enough on some imaginary eating disorder scale. Like it never happened. The reason I felt this way was because I never sought any help. There is nothing in my medical records to say how many years bulimia took hold of my life. Nothing to show how unhappy I was for so long and how it affected me almost every day throughout my adolescence and twenties. No medication or rehab. No family intervention. Bulimia didn\u2019t even change my body shape. Nobody knew but me. So I played it down in my head. Like it wasn\u2019t a big deal. In my twenties, being bulimic was just this thing that I did. I knew it was something I needed to deal with, but I still didn\u2019t like or love myself enough to take care of my own body. It was my way of punishing myself. I often think of all the years I wasted and wish I'd spoke to someone earlier. It\u2019s only now I can acknowledge what I was doing to myself. You don\u2019t have to be on your deathbed to be experiencing those awful thoughts that flood your mind and the dangerous behaviors that go with them. I wonder how many other people are out there like me, who haven\u2019t spoken up. There is no clear route out of an eating disorder or for pulling yourself out of that dark place. Recovery itself is a process. I am not bingeing and purging anymore, but have to work hard at it some days. Focusing on eating well and choosing good foods to fuel me. Having a support system. Speaking up when I need help. Not leaving it until it's too late. \u2014Nikki Wilson\n\nMy treatment, along with a degree in sociology, has taught me I starve, binge, purge \u2014 all in an attempt to gain control of something elusive but with the power to defeat me. Like any long-term relationship, negotiating my eating disorder with my body over the past 15 years \u2014 or even not having an eating disorder \u2014 has ebbed and flowed. There have been times I\u2019ve soothed myself to sleep rubbing my fingers against a protruding hip bone, as if it were an analgesic pumice. At other times, I\u2019ve pinched the excess fat above my hips between those same fingers in self-repulsion. Then there are times I\u2019m free from all that; I\u2019m in this world, making sense of it, living in it, my body navigating like a trusty companion to the thoughts, feelings, and desires it houses. I\u2019ve been a runner throughout my disease and recovery, and some of my happiest moments are when I\u2019m running uphill in the park smelling honeysuckle and priding myself on feeling strong for pushing through the wind, the incline, and feeling my muscles at work under my skin. Then I\u2019m like, Hey, body, we\u2019re in sync, and I feel present in the world. But what happens when that world is nonsensical? No matter how many sociology courses I\u2019ve taken, or years in treatment I\u2019ve spent, our culture rewards the discipline of dieting/juicing/detoxing and triangulates a relationship between thinness, success, and power. As much as my brain tells me not to read those headlines \u2014 to stay away from the Bermuda Triangle, sometimes, it sucks me in. But then I tell myself that I\u2019m in recovery, and as long as I\u2019m living, I\u2019m recovering. To me, recovery is about being present and feeling powerful because of what my body can do, not what it looks like. Eating disorders are distractions from being present. Everyone manages recovery differently, and I\u2019m making my way, trying my hardest not to damage my body. If I slip up today, I\u2019ll try again tomorrow until I find balance, and I\u2019m not thinking about the size of my body, but rather the scope of the world. \u2014Jill Di Donato\n\nI always thought my eating disorder started in college. I now see how my thinking was distorted growing up; the behaviors just didn\u2019t manifest until college. I became a binge drinker and used alcohol to feel comfortable around people. When I went home during summer and was no longer drinking, the beginning of my eating-disorder behaviors began. I hid my eating disorder for years, while loved ones only saw my drinking as out of control. Flipping between eating-disorder behaviors and drinking became my entire existence. I am lucky to be alive. In my late twenties, my parents threatened to drop me off at the county hospital or rehab; I chose rehab. When I went to rehab eight years ago, I left sober, yet incapable of eating without crying. I had no idea how to recover. I had a therapist, but felt alone in my journey, not yet knowing the evidenced-based treatment for eating disorders: It takes a village of therapists, psychiatrists, dietitians/nutritionists, coaches, and mentors. I scrambled alone for a year, relapsing over and over, until one day I had an aha moment driving by the beach: I had everything to lose and everything to gain by fighting for recovery. What ultimately saved me was finding a voice for myself and being loud with it; by becoming an activist I had to stop hiding and worrying about how I was perceived. I told my parents what support I needed and we learned together. Since I felt alone in my dual diagnosis, I became a \u201cvoice in recovery\u201d on social media, documenting my journey to educate myself about eating disorders, addictions, mental illness, mood disorders, and more. Today, I am seven years booze-free \u2014 happy, healthy, and definitely far from perfect. I have days where I may struggle with body image, but I no longer seek to control my feelings through alcohol or food; I utilize healthy coping skills that work for me, and seek to be vulnerable with my activism and voice. It is OK to not be OK, OK to ask for help, OK to fall, fail, crash and burn, and relapse; recovery isn\u2019t a straight line, and it can be a long journey, but I wouldn\u2019t change it for the world. I am who I am due to all I had to work through. I love and know myself. My life is a gift, and I am forever grateful to live it fully, with love and kindness toward not only myself but in giving toward others who may struggle as well. \u2014Kendra Sebelius\n\nI first had what I call \u201cenergy\u201d around food after my mother died when I was 13. Undergoing puberty, all of a sudden I lost my original shape, the one that resembled childhood and being with my mom. Bitter breast cancer took my mother\u2019s life, I was sick of uncontrollable things happening, and I craved a sense of control. Food, exercise, and my body were things I could control. I was held captive by my disorder in college and even through culinary school. By then I had developed osteoporosis, and I honestly was fed up (pun intended) with over-exercising and eating huge meals that left me bloated and tired. I checked myself into inpatient rehab and began recovery. I got my period and boobs back and started to feel somewhat at peace. I gained more than just weight \u2014 I felt like I gained back my identity. Although I looked healthy physically, I still had \u201cenergy\u201d around food. I\u2019d eat cookies and take days off from exercising, but I still felt guilty. Recovery to me meant I would be free of that guilt. When my father died a few months after being diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, I re-evaluated that \u201cenergy\u201d I had around food and weight. I was 24 and essentially an orphan. I saw my parents have their lives cut short and realized I was living \u2014 for nearly a decade \u2014 in a slow suicidal state. More than ever, I want to live. I wanted to be alive. Not just for me, but for my parents. I needed to be alive because they didn\u2019t get the chance to. Last year, I had a preventative double mastectomy because I carried a high-risk hereditary breast cancer gene. I didn\u2019t exercise for weeks and didn\u2019t feel guilty about it. Being free of the disease that haunted my mother was more important. I finally got a taste (pun sort of intended, again) of real recovery and empowerment. It was a big F-you to cancer, my eating disorder, and my fears. I can\u2019t believe I spent so much of my life wanting there to be less of me. I don\u2019t regret my eating disorder because it shaped who I am today. I\u2019m proud of the woman I am. I plan on being here for a while, and I still have so much more to gain. \u2014Eden Dranger\n\nI struggled with anorexia as an adolescent and for many years as an adult, after already being well. Many people trying to help me didn\u2019t believe I would have lasting recovery. I am now fully recovered and live free of eating-disorder thoughts, behaviors, and feelings. Now, as a counselor, coach, advocate, and storyteller, I draw on my experiences and struggles to be an ally to others. While people struggling with food, weight, and body issues and their families appreciate my \"insider\" knowledge and example of recovery, clinical professionals are more reserved, acknowledging my experiences but remaining cautious of my helping others as a \"peer.\" They forget that I am a peer to them, offering a unique ability to bridge the gap between both worlds. I speak up in places and with people that are receptive while still pushing the envelope. Current ways of understanding and treating people affected by eating disorders need to be challenged and expanded. It is important they hear stories based in strength. That they see a path to recovery focused on all aspects of life and experience, where bodies are not only restored but where lives are reclaimed. Where people are not seen only in light of their struggle but as whole beings able to live the life they choose. \u2014Ellie Hodges\n\nRainer Maria Rilke says, \u201cLive the questions now. Perhaps then, someday far in the future, you will gradually, without even noticing it, live your way into the answer.\u201d I have recently gathered enough courage to ask: What would be possible if I truly loved every single part of myself unconditionally? Who would I be hurting if I stopped apologizing for the amount of time and space I fill? How explosively liberating could it feel if I stopped believing that my beauty and worth are created only by a man\u2019s desire to see me naked? What would be possible if I allowed myself to deeply, honestly, radically, vulnerably, and unconditionally live these questions? Every so often, I pause to listen to the way I speak or observe the way my hands move. Every time, I am overwhelmed that my body, exactly how it exists at this moment, is the converging point of all the interactions I have ever had with every person I have ever met. My sense of humor has my sister\u2019s laughter seeping out of it. I peel Fuji apples with the same technique I watched my mother use during her elementary school lunch-packing years. My story, as I tell it these days, is a moment of gratitude for all of the women throughout my life who have helped to build the spaces in which we can begin to love ourselves. I carry all of them, and all of our sacred spaces, in the deep core of my being. To my mother, grandmother, and sister: You remind me that the skin on my bones was made possible by a long lineage of women who believe that the act of feeding others and sharing food is an intimate act of love and communion. To honor my body is the best way I know how to say thank you. \u2014Melanie Hsu\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCaroline Rothstein is a New York City-based writer, performer, body empowerment advocate, and educator.

On the one hand, that's amazing news for fans of Sylvia Plath's classic novel, especially since the 1979 made-for-TV movie adaptation didn't do it justice. But on the other hand... oh god please don't mess this up. Kirsten Dunst and various screenwriters, I hope you're listening, because here are the ten things I want to see in the Bell Jar movie.\n\n\n\nLook, I understand that it's no easy task to translate literature into film. Film is an entirely different medium. Some scenes that work on the page have to be nixed or entirely rewritten for screen. I get that. But if you're adapting something like The Hunger Games or Game of Thrones, it's easy enough to put most of the major plot points up on screen. They mostly involve people getting stuck with swords or arrows (no disrespect to either Game book). With a book like The Bell Jar, however, the plot revolves around Esther Greenwood's inner thoughts as she struggles with clinical depression. Esther is brilliant, talented, beautiful, and having a breakdown.\n\nIt's a tall order to do that story justice in just two hours on screen. But it's happening, so here's what I want to see:\n\n1. Esther eating all the caviar\n\n[Embed]\n\nSay what you want about the asylum and the suicide attempts. For me, the true set piece of the book is that scene when Esther eats all the caviar at one of the fancy intern dinners, even though the caviar is meant for the whole table. And she's excited about the avocados stuffed with crab. It's just such a human, identifiable moment. I want to see Dakota Fanning eat a bowl of caviar surreptitiously.\n\n2. Awkward intern life\n\n[Embed]\n\nLet's face it: most internships are garbage, no matter how prestigious. Esther gets it. She's supposed to be having the time of her living at this ritzy magazine in New York... but she's not. To fully understand Esther, the film has to show us just how phony and soulless her internship is in the beginning. That's where so much of the book's humor is, too (please don't give us a humorless version of The Bell Jar).\n\n\n\n3. Some version of \u201cthe fig tree\u201d moment\n\n[Embed]\n\nThe fig tree metaphor is one of the most famous passages from The Bell Jar, and with good reason. It encapsulates so much of Esther's crisis in that moment, as well as the crisis that all young people have on the verge of adulthood. What do I do with my life? What if I can't choose a path, and thereby lose every possible path?\n\n\n\n4. Sexism\n\n[Embed]\n\nI don't want the movie to be sexist, but I would like it to address sexism. Esther's breakdown has no one cause, and no easy solution. But boy is sexism a factor. Repeatedly, Esther brings up how she feels trapped by gender roles, how she's expected to cater to men, and in one scene she's physically attacked by her date. The sexism isn't all specific to the '50s, either. Hopefully a female director will get it.\n\n5. Academic pressure\n\n[Embed]\n\nEsther's a scholarship kid and a talented student, but she feels boxed in by higher education. The relentless drive to succeed is taking a toll on her mental health (glad that totally doesn't happen anymore, amiright?). She feels like all she's good for is winning academic accolades, and that toxic learning environment should come across in the film. Thousands of stressed out, unhappy students will identify.\n\n6. A nuanced portrayal of mental illness\n\n[Embed]\n\nThis should go without saying, but I'm going to say it. Esther isn't \"crazy\" or simply \"sad,\" she's suffering from depression. She's suicidal. That's a serious subject matter to take on. The Bell Jar is not just about Esther's suffering, though, it's about her recovery, and I hope the creative team is up to the challenge when it comes to painting a nuanced, non-romanticized portrait of illness and recovery.\n\n7. No sexy crying\n\n[Embed]\n\nI mean it. No sexy crying. Not once. No crying in the bathtub or in a state of undress. Only ugly, realistic crying, or I will walk out of the theater. Don't test me, filmmakers.\n\n8. Buddy must still be the worst\n\n[Embed] I don't want to see a love story shoved into The Bell Jar, guys. No thanks. Esther's kind-of boyfriend Buddy is your classic \"nice guy\" who's secretly the WORST, and that's how I want to see him portrayed. I mean (SPOILER ALERT), after his other ex-girlfriend commits suicide, he goes to Esther to ask if he drives women \"crazy.\" Um?? Make everyone's mental illness all about you much? And then he asks Esther who will marry her now that she's been institutionalized. UGH. 9. That scene where she hangs up on the math professor\n\n[Embed]\n\nEsther sleeps with a math professor who is also a little bit the worst, and who is not very helpful during a medical emergency. During a phone call he asks when he can see her again, and she says, \"Never,\" and hangs up. Please put that scene in the movie so I can high five the person next to me in the audience.\n\n10. A hopeful ending\n\n[Embed]\n\nThe book ends on a hopeful, if ambiguous note. And that's what I want to see onscreen. The story of a young woman who struggles with mental illness, but who recovers from an episode and looks to the future with hope. Let's not allow Sylvia Plath's own tragic death to overshadow the message of her writing. You got that? No downer endings.\n\nImages: mybookbath/Instagram, Giphy (10)", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/180917-the-bell-jar-movie-needs-to-include-these-10-things-to-do-the-story-justice", "summary": "The Bell Jar is being adapted for the big screen with Kirsten Dunst as the director and Dakota Fanning rumored to star.\nKirsten Dunst and various screenwriters, I hope you're listening, because here are the ten things I want to see in the Bell Jar movie.\nWith a book like The Bell Jar, however, the plot revolves around Esther Greenwood's inner thoughts as she struggles with clinical depression.\nSome version of \u201cthe fig tree\u201d moment[Embed]The fig tree metaphor is one of the most famous passages from The Bell Jar, and with good reason.\nBuddy must still be the worst[Embed] I don't want to see a love story shoved into The Bell Jar, guys.", "timescraped": 1513838516.823066, "category": {"words": 975, "personal": 20, "thirdperson": 30, "condition": 4, "recovery": 0}}, "be4382c79eb3092aa6c29ab23c6c2475": {"title": "24 Things You SHOULD Know About Mental Health", "image": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2013-11/campaign_images/webdr02/13/15/24-things-you-should-know-about-mental-health-1-24031-1384375477-13_big.jpg", "text": "2.

Delaney, $220 per month after insurance coverage Age: 22 Location: Cincinnati, Ohio What that covers: Therapy, medication, psychiatrist appointments \"After I was hospitalized, I was recommended to begin dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) to help treat borderline personality disorder, depression, anxiety, and self-harm. My insurance was great about covering my hospital stay and helping find and cover a psychiatrist, but when it came to seeking therapy I was given limited options that didn't include DBT. I have to pay $15 per session for my individual therapy and $40 per session for my group therapy. So it is $200 a month for me to receive therapy. Which puts a strain on my already tight budget. I am fortunate in the fact that my insurance completely covered one of my medications and a bit of my other two medications. I end up paying roughly $20 a month for my medications.\" Share On email Share On email\n\nShare On link Share On link Share This Link\n\nShare On facebook Share On facebook Share\n\n2. Dan, $90 per month after insurance coverage Age: 28 Location: New Jersey What that covers: Therapy \"I had to switch therapists this year because I changed jobs and thus my insurance changed.

My mother is a health insurance broker and as a result I have an exceptionally good health insurance plan through her job. I pay about $6 for a one month supply of generic Citalopram and the rest is covered by my insurance. The fact that I can afford my mental health care is pure luck. I happened to find the right people at the right time, and was fortunate enough to have parents willing to cover nearly 100% of the cost. Most people aren't so lucky.

Hannah sits alongside Amina, silently sketching out the word \"peace\" in large letters. Around her wrists are bandages, and a few small cuts can be seen starting to heal on her forearms. Home for Amina and Hannah right now is Elysian House, a type of mental health facility known as a \"recovery house\", where they, and ten others recovering from periods of being severely mentally unwell, have their own private rooms. Amina was referred to the recovery house four weeks earlier after being treated for extreme anxiety in nearby Barnet Hospital's psychiatric ward. \"I wasn't scared of going outside,\" she says, \"but in my flat I didn't feel safe and would have horrible panic attacks and palpitations. It was terrifying.\" Hannah does not feel up to talking. A recovery house acts a stepping stone for \"not actively suicidal\" mental health patients who no longer need to be on a hospital's psychiatric ward but are not considered ready to return to their homes. Round-the-clock access to therapeutic support and psychiatric services is available, but residents live independently \u2013 cooking their own food, maintaining their own rooms, and, most important, coming and going as they please. Social workers are also on hand to provide assistance to the many residents who find themselves homeless or unemployed as a result of being unwell. It is hoped that spending time in this halfway house will allow a more meaningful recovery that will prevent a patient from relapsing and returning to hospital later on. \"I saw an 18-year-old girl who'd originally been sent straight home from hospital after faking wellness just to get out, but before long she ended up back there because she wasn't ready,\" the service manager at Elysian House tells us. \"Without somewhere like this, you end up with a revolving door to the hospital.\" Elysian House is one of nine recovery houses in England run by mental health charity ReThink Mental Illness, all of which have up to 20 beds and are supported by local NHS trusts. Three of them, including Elysian House, are in north London. Several other similar facilities also exist, such as the Mosaic Clubhouse in Brixton, a partnership between South London & Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust and the Lambeth Living Well collaborative; and Tile House, a project providing supported accommodation for people with long-term mental health issues run by Camden & Islington NHS Foundation Trust and One Housing Group. But because recovery houses are provided by a mixture of the NHS, charities, and the private sector, establishing a national picture of how many are available and where is difficult. The Department of Health, while acknowledging the existence of this kind of mental health facility, says it does not keep central records on how many there are, or the costs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"There isn't consistency with mental health services provision at all, frankly,\" Brian Dow, director of external affairs at ReThink, tells BuzzFeed News. \"Depending on where you are, and the nature of your condition, you could end up with great treatment or nothing.\" The patchwork nature of provision also makes recovery houses extremely vulnerable to spending cuts. Since February 2014, 27 national bodies involved in health, policing, social care, local government, and the voluntary sector have signed the Crisis Care Concordat, a government initiative to ensure the quality and availability of crisis and emergency care, as well as access to pre-crisis and recovery support. But despite David Cameron's call to create a \"parity of care\" between mental and physical health, around 40% of mental health trusts saw a cut to their funding in 2013-14, according to a recent study by independent healthcare charity the King's Fund. Such cuts have led to community services such as recovery houses being placed under huge strain. The merging of crisis-resolution home-treatment teams and early-access psychosis services also meant that many patients in crisis or with severe mental health problems were not being provided with the correct mental health support, the King's Fund found.\n\nThe government pledged to put \u00a3600 million back into mental health in its recent spending review, but the sector has seen funding cut by roughly the same amount since 2010, according to ReThink, and it is still not clear how the money will be spent. A detailed outline of the government's plans for mental health spending over the next five years is expected in early 2016. \"Extra money in the NHS as a whole is obviously welcome,\" Paul Jenkins, vice chair of the Cavendish Square Group, a collection of London's NHS trusts responsible for mental health, tells us. \"But the government is upping support for a system that's under a lot of pressure, so there'll be a lot of things that need funding still.\" He expresses concern that this new funding could simply be a \"rebadging\" of money already promised to mental health services. At Elysian House, all twelve beds are filled when BuzzFeed News visits, mostly by patients diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or personality disorders, which the service manager says are the conditions she sees most frequently. Its contract for NHS funding, which will be decided by the local clinical commissioning group, is up for renewal next year. And while the house is considered to be performing well according to referral and discharge targets, as well as patient feedback, there is no guarantee that it will continue to be supported. Without NHS funding, the future of Elysian House and the services it provides is unclear. \"It's difficult, because commissioners are quite right to want to make sure they're getting the best value for money, but sometimes complex services like recovery houses really benefit from having a longer contract,\" ReThink's Brian Dow says. \"It can take time to get the service right, and people need to get continuity of care as well.\" Dow tells us that the mark of success for recovery houses will be seeing them provide a consistent level of care throughout the UK, but the disparate availability of this type of service means this is not currently possible. \"Having something that's between a hospital and home that helps people get back on their feet is probably the best chance somebody has of a long-term sustained recovery,\" he says.\n\nFor former Elysian House resident Matthew, spending time there last summer (after a short spell on a psychiatric ward where he'd been admitted for depression) gave him that chance. \"Just spending a few days in hospital wouldn't have changed the reasons for me being there,\" he says. \"Having the opportunity to take some more time at a recovery house to sort more things out and understand more about how I could recover helped me a lot in my process.\" During his time there, Matthew met David, who was referred to Elysian House when a difficult period coming off long-term medication for bipolar disorder and suicidal thoughts led him to hospital. He too found the house's environment far more conducive to recovery than hospital. \"In hospital there's a tremendous amount of stress because of the fact that it's housing anybody with a severe mental health need,\" David says. While David and Matthew give huge credit to the staff at Elysian House for the role they played in their recovery, both feel that a greater connection between hospitals and community care afterwards is needed, allowing patients to be treated by the same doctors throughout their illness and recovery, for example. \"You need someone to be able to see you through your entire journey to recovery so that you don't have to keep recounting your story again and again at each stage of treatment,\" David says. \"By the time I arrived at the recovery house it was probably the fourth time I had had to go through it, and that was very stressful.\" He and Matthew agree that having the opportunity to support each other at Elysian House was key to their successful recoveries. But they count themselves lucky to have ended up together in a house with the kind of communal environment that allowed them to do that. \"We could have easily slipped through the net, as a lot of people do,\" David warns. \"A lot of people become lost souls.\"\n\nLaura Silver is a reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in London.

Symptoms, which usually begin between ages 16 and 30, primarily include hallucinations and delusions, but access to therapy, medication, and effective support systems allows people with schizophrenia to successfully manage those symptoms. Still, misconceptions \u2014 like the belief that schizophrenia makes people inherently violent (it doesn't) \u2014 persist. Mental illness looks different for every person who experiences it. Below are three honest accounts from people who live with schizophrenia \u2014 what it's actually like, how it affects their lives, and what they wish people understood about it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCan you tell me about when you were diagnosed? What led to it? Ashley Smith: I was 20, and I had a psychotic break \u2014 hallucinations, paranoia, everything but sanity. I ended up on a high-speed chase with the police because I thought everyone was against me. I thought everyone was demonic, and I thought I could protect and save myself if I kept driving. It wasn't a plan, or anything like that. I just happened to see a pickup truck in the airport parking lot \u2014 I was trying to get back home because I dropped out of college and I relocated to California to be with family \u2014 and I ended up jailed for two months, hospitalized for three, because I failed the competency test, which asked simple questions like who's the president, what's the date. I couldn't answer. Had you ever experienced anything like this growing up? AS: No, this was all shocking to me and my family. I had never been arrested or jailed or even hospitalized for something that serious. What happened once you got in the hospital? AS: I became catatonic. I wouldn't move \u2014 literally sitting in my chair, or laying in my bed for hours at a time, days on end, and I lost a lot of weight. I was under 100 pounds at one time. They had to keep me hydrated via IV; they gave me protein shakes to drink to gain my weight back. It was a process. I was in group therapy but didn't really participate because I thought it was beneath me, and then I realized I had this diagnosis, and that I needed to be there. Was it hard coming to terms with your diagnosis? AS: Yeah, but there's no way around it. No one could lie to me; I was in jail. So that was a hardcore lesson learned \u2014 but it actually turned out to be a miracle in the long run, because at least I didn't do anything else with the law. At least it happened sooner rather than later. I could've had a family, gotten married, and then have this hiccup. Instead it turned out to be my new career, being a peer counselor, certified peer specialist (CPS). Tell me about that. AS: I was certified in 2012, but I've actually been a peer counselor since 2009 because I started doing NAMI groups in the community, and also my own support group, which I started with the support of my therapist. I learned how to manage groups with her; she helped guide me into my CPS position by giving me the application, and by helping me, and started that in 2009.\n\nHow did you start? AS: After I was diagnosed, I got my sentencing reduced from a felony to a misdemeanor, because of my diagnosis of schizophrenia, and because I had a clean criminal record and good references from my church family and my family. My social worker in jail referred me to an outpatient program that offered housing, so I was there for almost a year, probably about seven or eight months, but when I went back to Atlanta \u2014 my family is in California, but I was raised in Atlanta \u2014 I was really isolated. I had disability income but no health insurance, and no program to attend. So I actually pushed myself out of my comfort zone to go to seek group therapy and that worked in the long run for me. I had thoughts of depression but I learned a lot of coping skills. Having this diagnosis, as well as the privilege and opportunity to work in this sort of recovery, is actually very enlightening and supportive and healthy. I'm able to share my experiences with clients, or peers, rather. And then we're able to connect and to have a sense of hope, and have that understanding of what we're capable of, you know? Do symptoms still arise for you? AS: I have depressive symptoms, but my schizophrenia is in remission. I haven't hallucinated or been delusional since 2007. I've been on antipsychotics that help me maintain and manage my symptoms. My biggest struggle today is my depression, but I'm doing so well with my coping skills that I'm no longer taking my antidepressants. But I will fall back on them if I need to in the future. What sort of coping skills do you use? AS: It's a ritual, almost. I create thoughts for the day, or affirmations. I think about my mom, I talk to my mom, who passed from breast cancer a couple years back. She was my biggest cheerleader, my biggest support with my diagnosis and what I was trying to do in the community, and in life. I journal, which is one of the best coping mechanisms for me \u2014 it really does work to vent, to release that negative self-talk. During the day, if I feel my energy about to drop, I take a walk around my agency building, and I just get some fresh air and feel the weather on my skin. It isn't a cure-all or anything, but it helps me in that moment of anxiety and depression. I definitely talk to my friends and family who know about my diagnosis, like recovery partnerships, peers.\n\nHave friends and family been supportive? AS: Oh very much so. In the beginning, my family and friends did not understand what schizophrenia was, and we're still learning together, but I have a lot of support. My family is actually back in California. I live in Atlanta by myself, which shows the support that I have here in Atlanta through my colleagues and other peer counselors. You're obviously really open about this\u2014 AS: Oh, yeah, it's my job. Do you find people are surprised to hear you have schizophrenia when they find out? Do you still encounter stigma? AS: Stigma is kind of limited because of the environment I place myself in; I'm very much involved in the recovery community here in Atlanta, so I don't experience a lot of stigma, but it doesn't mean it's not there. I definitely have encountered it, especially in regular settings, like in housing \u2014 when I've had to apply for housing here in Atlanta and back in California. How did the people you were applying to know your diagnosis? AS: Because of my income. They asked me my source of income, and I'd say social security disability, supplemental security income, and they'd ask why \u2014 which they're not supposed to ask, but they do. I was very naive and I told them my diagnosis and then they started to talk me out of it, and ask me these questions, implying I'm not well, because they don't know what recovery looks like, or that recovery is even possible with schizophrenia. A lot of people still don't know, which is very disheartening. What's something you wish more people understood about schizophrenia? AS: I wish that people would have a more open mind to the fact that people with mental illness \u2014 any mental illness \u2014 can and do get better, with proper treatment, adequate support systems, and access to care. And because of my experience, I can say there's hope for everyone within this diagnosis. I was so far gone \u2014 I was catatonic; I was not in reality \u2014 and now, I'm a single parent. My son's about to be 4. I live in a tenement; I rent a house. I work full time. I have a book out; I self-published it last year, and now it's used at conferences for recovery, and it's in every jail or prison in Georgia. I manage my depression with daily coping mechanisms and partnerships with my friends who are also recovering. I do things in the community, which I enjoy and love. I'm living my life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen were you diagnosed? Michelle Hammer: I was diagnosed schizophrenic at 22, but I was diagnosed as bipolar when I was 18 or 19, in college. I was living with some roommates at the time and, after college, when I was living with the same people, I told them, \u201cHey, so they found out I\u2019m actually schizophrenic,\u201d and they were like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s what we always thought you had.\u201d So it was kind of like I was the last person to know. How did you handle being diagnosed? MH: I was upset for a bit, but what are you going to do? It\u2019s not going to go away, so why be depressed about it? Why not turn it into something good? Which is what I\u2019m trying to do with [clothing line and advocacy organization] Schizophrenic NYC. How does schizophrenia manifest for you? MH: For me, I kind of zone out, daydream, and what looks to other people like talking to myself. But really, it\u2019s a very vivid daydream. As long as I know what\u2019s real and what\u2019s fake, I know I\u2019m OK. Do you feel like you are able to tell the difference between what\u2019s real and what\u2019s fake? MH: Yes. I hope so! How has schizophrenia affected your relationships? Is your family supportive? MH: No one\u2019s really said anything too bad to me. Most people have been supportive. When I was diagnosed, my mom gave everybody a book about schizophrenia to read but with a generic book cover on it, so no one knew what they were reading. But then there are people who thought it meant I was batshit crazy. Have you come up against the stigma, either about schizophrenia specifically or mental illness in general? MH: I meet a lot of people with my pop-up shops, so I hear a lot of stories about people\u2019s friends, family, acquaintances. Sometimes I just like to hear the stupid things people say. Like what? MH: I was talking with one woman for a while and I asked her, \u201cHave you ever met a person with schizophrenia?\u201d and she said, \u201cNo, and I never want to.\u201d And I didn\u2019t tell her, you are right now! But yeah, I hear a lot of stupid things.\n\nWhat\u2019s your treatment been like? MH: Well, I go to a psychiatrist every other week, and, like I said, my friends and family help, but really my treatment is just taking my medications. Were you resistant to medication at first? MH: Oh yeah. Absolutely. When I was 19, I took something that made me horribly angry, miserable. But I was just taking the wrong thing. It\u2019s hard to find the right one, and it\u2019s a long process, because you take one thing for one problem, and then another thing for the side effect from that one, and then another one\u2026 Do you feel like you\u2019ve found the right mix? MH: Oh, definitely. Definitely. Without these medications, I\u2019d be living on disability, in some halfway house. I\u2019d never be able to function, have a job, not even for one day. Can you tell me more about Schizophrenic NYC, why you were inspired to launch it? MH: I wanted to spread awareness about the mentally ill homeless. I was on the subway one night, and I saw a homeless man who was clearly schizophrenic \u2014 zoned out, talking to himself, had no idea what was real and what wasn\u2019t. And I realized \u2014 I know that if I didn\u2019t have my family, my friends, my doctor, I could be that. I could so easily be homeless. It\u2019s about getting that support. When did you start? MH: I started in May 2015, after I was fired from my seventh job \u2014 you know, I was curious so I counted it up recently, and it\u2019s seven jobs I\u2019ve been fired from since my diagnosis. Do you think there\u2019s a correlation there? MH: I think schizophrenia definitely affects the way I can work. I feel like I don\u2019t have that normal mindset \u2014 waking up, getting to work on time, sitting at a desk, leaving at the same time every day. It\u2019s not my kind of work flow, not my situation. It wasn\u2019t very creative. I\u2019ve realized the best thing is for me to be my own boss, so I wanted to start my own business. But I do have a new job, too, a graphic design job. So you're doing that on top of the shop? That\u2019s probably a heavy workload. MH: It is, but I like it! I love the pop-ups; it\u2019s fun. I get to chitchat with a lot of people. Right now, I\u2019m running the business by myself. People ask me where I\u2019m based, do I have internships, but really, it\u2019s just me \u2014 for now. I have plans to expand. What\u2019s something you wish more people understood about schizophrenia? MH: They don\u2019t realize how common it is, how many people with schizophrenia are walking around them. Nobody that I currently work with knows I\u2019m schizophrenic. I don\u2019t tell anyone, because of the stigma. It\u2019s funny, my whole life people have told me I\u2019m weird. Now, when I tell them I\u2019m schizophrenic, they say, \u201cBut you\u2019re so normal!\u201d\n\nHow old were you when you were diagnosed? Daniel: Around 7 to 10 years old. How did you handle receiving the diagnosis? D: I didn't realize understand what it meant, though when I looked into it more in my teen years I began to privately embrace it. I've only been open about my schizophrenia for the past few years. How does schizophrenia manifest for you? D: Well, when I was younger it was especially bad \u2014 auditory and physical hallucinations, and states of dissociation. Nowadays, I've been coping with it, and the hallucinations aren't so often. A lot of my symptoms recently have been states of delusional thinking or dissociation. For example, I might have a delusion of grandiosity or power that isn't really there. Can you tell me more about that? What might happen when you have a delusion of grandiosity? D: Nothing too bad, I'll just somehow convince myself that I am somehow above others around me, that I'm worth more than others. Some people with that delusion may even convince themselves they're a god, or some other divine being.\n\nHow has schizophrenia affected your relationships, if at all? D: Maintaining friendships can be very complicated, and romantic relationships even harder. Since I'm quite emotionally detached, maintaining a romantic relationship with someone who doesn't quite understand me can be hard. They tend to think I don't care enough about them, when I just have a hard time showing that affection. I don't talk much, and when I do I tend to be very repetitive with my words; I keep to myself, so others may become distant because of that. I'm very detached from others around me, even my own family. Most of my family will hug or nudge each other around playfully \u2014 they have this sort of physical connection with each other. I do not. I don't really hug my family. I don't even touch them; I just don't feel that connection. Has your family been supportive? D: Family has been as supportive as they can be. If I have a breakdown, I tend to retract, keeping to myself, or my friends. Schizophrenia runs through one side of my family, so they have a decent understanding of my situation.\n\nAre you in school, or working? D: I am both a college student and have a part-time job at a pizza chain. How does schizophrenia affect that? D: It can add extra stress onto school and work, though I've learned when to pull back so I won't overwork myself. Since I've had it my whole life, I'm very aware of what I can and can't do. What's your treatment been like? D: I don't believe in or agree with the medication used for schizophrenia; I think it more so dulls your emotions. So, much of my treatment has been coping with my symptoms, and finding those who are understanding and trustworthy enough for me to talk to. Did you have a bad experience with medication? D: Not me personally, but with others I have met. I understand medication being used in extreme cases, but for many, it isn't necessary, in my opinion. I disagree with much of the medicinal practice \u2014 again not based on experience, rather research.\n\nDo you often encounter stigma? D: Yes. When I open up about having schizophrenia, people often think about school shooters or \"psycho murderers\" you'll see in movies and books. There is a lot of social stigma surrounding schizophrenia, that we're all \"crazy,\" or that we're harmful in general. Many times, schizophrenia itself will be used as the antagonist in horror stories or movies, and it's been used so often as a trope that schizophrenic patients start to become demonized for it. What's something you wish more people understood about schizophrenia? D: I wish people understood we are not like you see in the movies. We are real people, with real emotions, and a real desire and need to be understood. More than anything, being understood is what I long for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement", "url": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/ariannarebolini/this-is-what-its-like-to-live-with-schizophrenia", "summary": "Below are three honest accounts from people who live with schizophrenia \u2014 what it's actually like, how it affects their lives, and what they wish people understood about it.\nMH: They don\u2019t realize how common it is, how many people with schizophrenia are walking around them.\nD: I don't believe in or agree with the medication used for schizophrenia; I think it more so dulls your emotions.\nWhen I open up about having schizophrenia, people often think about school shooters or \"psycho murderers\" you'll see in movies and books.\nThere is a lot of social stigma surrounding schizophrenia, that we're all \"crazy,\" or that we're harmful in general.", "timescraped": 1513838529.2273889, "category": {"words": 3029, "personal": 211, "thirdperson": 27, "condition": 8, "recovery": 4}}, "40fcaf044fd5aad953691cf710d068a8": {"title": "Here's How Ten Countries Approach Mental Health", "image": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2015-12/14/14/campaign_images/webdr04/heres-how-ten-countries-approach-mental-health-2-16656-1450122036-0_dblbig.jpg", "text": "We asked our colleagues in ten BuzzFeed offices to talk about what mental health is like where they live.\n\nThe ways people perceive, talk about, and treat mental illness vary around the world.

Attitudes around mental health and access to treatment also vary widely within each country by gender, age, cultural experience, geography, income, profession, and so many other factors. This conversation is a starting point based on our own experiences and reporting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJenna Guillaume: I think it's still very much a taboo topic. While people are becoming more open about it \u2014 especially younger people \u2014 and campaigns like Mental Health Week (in October in Australia) and organisations like Headspace and the Black Dog Institute are helping to destigmatize mental health issues, I would say many people still find it hard to talk about. Personally, I have spoken to close friends and family about my anxiety, and have asked a close friend for a therapist recommendation as she was dealing with similar issues. But for a long time I was ashamed to talk about it, and I do think that is partially because of the stigma that still exists in Australia.\n\nIran Giusti and Flora Paul: It's hard to be open about it. If you're on medications or go to therapy, it's not something you usually talk about. And if you talk about it, it's usually in a very casual way, like, \"Oh, I have such anxiety.\" You don't usually ask friends or family for recommendations, and even health professionals don't usually recommend mental health treatments, unless you ask.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKat Angus: While there is a fair amount of social stigma surrounding mental health issues in Canada, it definitely feels as though people are slowly realizing that mental health concerns everyone and that mental illness is nothing to be ashamed of. Don't get me wrong \u2014 it's still rare for people to speak publicly about their struggles, but I personally have discussed my past with depression and my suicide attempt with family and friends, only to find out that many of them also struggled with mental illness. It's easier to understand that we're not alone. Elamin Abdelmahmoud: There have been a lot of campaigns to work on fighting stigma around mental health in Canada recently, and that's positive. But we need those campaigns because stigma is strong here and there isn't an ease with which we talk about mental health.\n\nMarie Telling: It's not openly discussed that much, although people tend to be more open about it in big cities, especially Paris, where it's more common to admit seeing a therapist and to ask for recommendations from friends. Mental illness is still stigmatized a lot and associated with notions of danger, social exclusion, irresponsibility, and unreliability. According to a study from 2009, almost 70% of French people believe mental illnesses \"aren't like other illnesses.\" So there is still a lot of stigma, shame, and secrecy surrounding the recognition and treatment of mental illness, which often prevents people from getting treated right away, or at all. There is also the idea that you should \"be strong\" and \"get over yourself\" when you're depressed or anxious rather than \"medicalize\" it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDani Beck: It really depends on your environment. Some people are very open and understanding; others don't know how to handle it. If you feel comfortable with a friend, it's fine to ask for a recommendation. If you work for a company that looks after their employees' (mental) health, you might even be able to ask there. But generally it seems safer to keep it a secret. Friends and family often believe clich\u00e9s the media spreads, such as people who are depressed just need to \"cheer up.\"\n\nAndre Borges: I do believe that there are some people in India who are open to having discussions on depression, PTSD, substance abuse, and social anxiety, but for the majority of people these disorders are still quite stigmatized. I think people feel the need to hide their social anxieties, not so much from their parents, but from their peers and friends. When it comes to therapy, people don't talk about it while they're in it, but maybe once they're done with it, they'll tell a close friend or a relative. The biggest stigma out here is probably the fact that if you admit you are diagnosed with a mental illness, people think you're crazy. People don't equate mental health with being a medical issue. So it seems like something outside the vein of normal. Hence to get treated for these ills makes you a pariah at times.\n\nBaxter Aceves: Going to therapy or accepting that you need guidance/counseling has become more and more ~acceptable~. However, there are still a lot of cases (with more complicated issues, like autism) where families choose to \"hide\" the patients from society. So, in a nutshell, people are opening a little bit more to this, but there is a long way to go on this subject.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeatriz Serrano: People feel kind of ashamed to say openly that they go to therapy, and you usually only talk about big mental health topics with close friends and family members. The way people perceive mental illness has changed a lot over the past few years, but while people believe it's ok to go to therapy if \"something happened to you\" (if someone close to you died or you got a divorce, for instance), things are different when you have a mental illness \"out of nowhere.\" There is a lack of information about it in general.\n\nEllie Bate: I think, while we're getting better at talking about it and campaigns such as Time to Change have been launched to put an end to the stigma associated with mental health, it's definitely considered un-British to openly discuss your mental health. Before I moved to London, nobody I knew had ever attended therapy, and talking about mental health issues was pretty much taboo. It's more of a behind-closed-doors kind of thing, and that's if it's talked about at all. There's definitely an attitude in Britain of keeping your problems to yourself and maintaining that traditional British stiff upper lip, and I definitely think that extends to discussions of mental health.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSusie Armitage: I can only speak from my own experience as a white woman who was born here. These stories about mental health by writers of color explore a much broader range of experiences, including how the immigration system and racism can have an impact on mental health. I sought help when I was in my early twenties for anxiety and depression. One friend who knew asked me for the name of my doctor. But mostly it felt like something I had to hide. I was living in Washington, D.C., where a lot of jobs require security clearances and extensive background checks. I never actually went through that process, but it felt like everyone had a \"permanent record\" somewhere. I worried about employers finding out. I do think there's a pro-self-help mentality in American culture, and that extends to mental health. More and more, seeking help is becoming seen as a positive thing. But there's still stigma.\n\nJG: I think on the whole the mainstream media in Australia has made a concerted effort in the past few years to report on mental health issues in an open and frank way. During Mental Health Week in October, the ABC dedicates a whole week of programming to the subject, called \"Mental As,\" and there are shows like Josh Thomas's Please Like Me that tackle mental health in a sensitive and authentic way. There've been a few high-profile people speaking openly about their mental health \u2014 actors like Ruby Rose, TV presenters like Jessica Rowe, and sports stars like Matthew Mitcham and Buddy Franklin. The response of the public has been quite reassuring and supportive on the whole. But this is mostly after an awful incident in 2014 where model and TV personality Charlotte Dawson ended her own life after she was open about her depression and faced extensive online bullying. It did lead to increased awareness and more open conversations.\n\nIG and FP: The media only covers mental health on rare occasions, and there's usually something glamorous about it. Famous actor Ana Paula Ar\u00f3sio quit a telenovela on primetime and news reports said she was suffering from depression, but she never talked about it. A model named Cibele Dorsa killed herself after her boyfriend's suicide. Caras, a Brazilian magazine (similar to Hello), had her on the cover with the headline \"She died for love.\"\n\nKA: The most high-profile mental health initiative in Canada is Bell Let's Talk Day. Every year since 2010, the Let's Talk initiative has used one day each January to encourage people to speak openly and honestly about their experiences and struggles with mental health. It has been a hugely successful initiative that has helped raise money, awareness, and compassion for mental health across the country. But while Bell Let's Talk Day has been a big success in Canada (the initiative recently extended its commitment through to 2020 with $100 million), it can sometimes feel as though discussion of mental health during the rest of the year is often swept under the rug. It's certainly better to have one day of discussing mental health rather than zero days, but when so much focus is put on one specific day, it can seem as though that is the only time to discuss the issue.\n\nMT: According to Viviane Kovess-Masfety, an expert in epidemiology in mental health, the French media \"never talks about mental health in a positive way, but always in a dramatic way. It has very negative and dangerous consequences on the patients and their families.\" French media has participated in the stigmatization of mental illnesses, and French news usually covers the issue only after something tragic happens. Several French celebrities have talked about living with depression and going to therapy. But in the press, depression is always reported as being the consequence of a tragic event \u2014 this one celebrity was depressed after breaking up with her boyfriend, this other one after his movie flopped, etc.\n\nDB: Some sports stars have been very open about mental health. Sebastian Deisler, for instance, quit his successful career because of depression. Bruce Darnell who used to be on Germany's Next Topmodel and is a judge on Germany's Got Talent (Das Supertalent), also spoke about his mental health. Generally the media assumes, but no one really admits. Eating or drinking disorders are pretty much the only thing people admit to having. Nothing like autism, depression or OCD is ever publicly discussed. The public believes clich\u00e9s such as OCD is like Monk, and depression is something every VIP has about four times a year when a photo of them looking sad is taken.\n\nAB: It hasn't been touched upon much in Bollywood. There are a couple of films, like Barfi, Hasee Toh Phasee, and Taare Zameen Par, that have touched upon autism, ADHD, and dyslexia. But those are the outliers. Most films don't talk about mental health much. The industry is pretty vocal about problems like depression, and other illnesses, though. Over the past few years, several celebrities have spoken out about depression, anxiety, and other struggles. Shah Rukh Khan, Anushka Sharma, and most notably Deepika Padukone have been extremely vocal. Deepika has even started a foundation to help people deal with depression.\n\nBA: When celebrities have a breakdown, they mostly become religious. But there haven't been many examples of celebrities actually accepting mental illness. A TV host named Mauricio Clark said he was suffering from addiction and \"emotional illness\" on TV, and said the reason for his addiction was that he didn't accept his homosexuality and was struggling with society's prejudices.\n\nBS: I asked the rest of the newsroom and it's weird how we can remember celebrities speaking about fighting against cancer but not fighting against depression, for example. From time to time, lists about \"celebrities with mental illness\" are published, but they are all from the U.S. or the UK. There is a lack of information about it, but it's changing. Since depression is one of the most common illness, the media is starting to talk about it, though it's still not a \"popular\" topic.\n\nEB: There are often storylines in our big soap operas that deal with mental health issues, and at the end of the episode they will advertise hotlines and websites for people suffering with similar problems, which I think is great. There have been a few big celebrities open up about their issues with mental health, like J.K. Rowling, and recently Tom Fletcher from McFly talked about his depression. Now that the internet is such a huge platform, as well, it's definitely become easier for people to share their experiences with mental illness. One of the most prevalent ambassadors for mental health care in the UK, for example, is YouTuber Zoella. Again, I think British media has improved a lot in terms of speaking out about mental health, but we still have a long way to go before it's completely accepted.\n\nSA: A good number of celebs are speaking about their own experiences with mental illness and getting mostly positive feedback. I think the tendency of American culture toward openness and personal stories helps foster that. But there's still a lot of work to do. For example, the Associated Press Stylebook, which is used by journalists across the U.S., didn't have a section on mental illness until 2013.\n\nJG: A National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing conducted in 2014 found that almost 1 in 7 (14%) of 4- to 17-year-old Australians were assessed as having a mental health disorder in the previous 12 months. But there is more help at hand than ever before. A family general practitioner (GP) is still one of the best service providers for young people in need. And at Kids Helpline, young people can speak to a counselor on the phone 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The service talks with more than 5,500 kids each week. There are school counselors in high schools. However, when I was at school, there was definitely stigma around it, and people gossiped if you went to see the counselor. I think it has probably lessened somewhat since then, but with the increase of mobile phone usage and the internet, bullying and associated mental health concerns seem to have gotten worse.\n\nIG and FP: It isn't very common for kids to go to therapy. If your parents are divorcing, maybe, but even so, you have to be from a very upper-class family to do so. In general there are no counselors in high school. If a kid \"causes trouble,\" the school will likely just call the parents.\n\nEA: Here's a wild statistic: in Canada, 70% of young adults living with mental health problems say their problems started in childhood. That's a high number and one that isn't talked about a lot. Canada is in the middle of a (slow) cultural shift to talk about mental health more openly, but children's mental health is not a significant part of that conversation. KA: As a depressed and suicidal teenager in Ontario, I was lucky enough to get the help I needed when I asked for it. My guidance counselors were open to discussing my issues with me, and helped me talk to my parents about the support I needed. From there, I was given access to social workers, psychiatrists, and therapists who were vital to my recovery. My university also offered personal and mental health counseling to its students, though it was well-known that the wait time for an appointment could be lengthy. As is frequently the case, there often aren't enough resources to handle the demand.\n\nMT: There is a real fear of over-medicalizing the behaviors of some children. Another challenge is ideological and the source of many debates: The vast majority of child psychiatrists belong to the psychoanalytic movement and are therefore strongly opposed to cognitive behavioral therapy, a method used in many countries to treat children and teenagers dealing with mental illnesses. A study from 2012 also underlined the lack of mental health practitioners in schools and the weaknesses of their training when they were there. School psychologists do exist in France, but they're not present in every school. I personally do not remember ever hearing about a psychologist at my school, and I honestly cannot remember ever talking about mental health in class or being taught anything about it before college.\n\nDB: Children's mental health care is perceived the same way mental health care in general is perceived, and faces similar challenges. When I went to school (1992\u20132005), it was never discussed at all. There were some teachers you could go to, but not really any \"experts.\"\n\nAB: It's actually a lot better in schools these days. There are procedures in place to flag children who might have certain problems. A lot of schools are also organizing mentor programs in which the older students are trained to help other students with problems. Apart from that, schools are also hiring staff counselors to speak to students who are distracted, to find the cause of distraction in class and figure out what the underlying problem is.\n\nBA: Every school has a psychologist, because it's mandatory in middle school and there are some schools that start in kindergarten up to high school. Their job does not involve full-on therapy, however, but rather is to identify children's problems and redirect them to specialists who can address them. Obviously, this happens only if the family has enough resources to pay. The main reasons kids go to a psychologist are derived from their parents' relationship status: domestic violence, divorce, having their parents split because of economic reasons (father crossing to the U.S. in order to provide for his family, etc.).\n\nBS: We had \"counselors,\" and the funny thing is that they were all psychologists but we never called them that. Mental health isn't discussed at all at school. If a kid has a problem, they can go to the counselor and maybe after that to a psychologist. But it's not a topic discussed at school. In Spain we have national insurance, and the doctor can guide a child to a therapist.\n\nEB: According to the British Association of Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP), between 64 and 80% of secondary schools in England have some kind of access to counselling. However, there is still a long way to go to improve children's mental health care in the UK. In a 2015 report, the Department of Health advocates, among other things, for a hard-hitting anti-stigma campaign, better access to effective mental health support, and the integration of mental health specialists directly into schools and GP practices. When I was growing up, no one ever considered that I or any of my friends could have any problems with their mental health. I have never known a child to go to therapy. There definitely wasn't an onsite psychiatrist in mine or any of my friends' schools. I think it's always just assumed here that \u2013 unless they're showing very clear signs of some kind of mental health issue \u2013 kids are all fine.\n\nSA: We had a peer-counseling program in my high school that trained kids to talk to other kids, including when to notify an adult if the problem was serious. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as many as 20% of children in the U.S. \"experience a mental disorder in a given year.\" A review of children's access to mental health care found that a lot of kids who need mental health services don't get them, and when they do, it's not necessarily with the right specialists or for enough time.\n\nJG: Finding a therapist is really easy \u2014 if you know how! You can go to your GP directly for treatment, and if they think you require additional help, they will refer you to a specialist. This usually involves a mental health care plan, which will include up to 10 free sessions of counseling per year. The GP may refer you to someone in particular, or you can choose to find someone on your own. But most people don't realize that GPs are there to help you with mental illness as well as physical illnesses. Lack of education and awareness is the biggest barrier. The funny thing is I think we actually have some pretty good mental health care options available \u2014 from dedicated organizations to government-subsidized therapy sessions \u2014 but because it's not talked about too often, I feel like a lot of people don't even know what options are available. On the plus side, I feel like this is improving as the stigma decreases more and more, but there is still a lot of work to do in this area.\n\nIG and FP: When you're looking for a mental health practitioner, in general you look for recommendations on private care services or online. Private health care has a limit of around 10 therapy sessions a year and you can only get them if you have a medical recommendation for it. When it comes to psychiatry, the public and private health care systems usually deal with it the same way: You just go there to get your prescription meds and that's it, not much talking.\n\nKA: Although Canada does enjoy universal health care, mental health is largely not covered by our health care system, forcing most who require mental health services to pay for it out of pocket. Some workplace health insurance plans do provide coverage for mental health services. However, the extent of these plans depends on what the employer has subscribed to. Some workplace plans will cover enough for a few appointments with a psychiatrist or therapist, but often not enough to allow for ongoing visits \u2014 and many workplace health plans don't cover mental health at all. Access to free services also depends on location, as rural communities frequently struggle to provide services to residents. The northern Canadian territory of Nunavut currently has the highest suicide rate in the country, and its remote location makes it even more difficult to provide mental health resources to the people who live there.\n\nMT: Paris and other major cities have way more mental health practitioners than the rest of France, making it much easier to get access to mental health in these places than in smaller cities and rural areas. The French health care system only covers being treated by a psychiatrist, not by a psychologist, which makes access to therapy harder for many people. And even with a psychiatrist, you may have to pay part of the cost yourself if the doctor decides to charge more than what is covered. A big part of the issue also has to do with information. The stigma surrounding mental health is still very much there and people don't often think about going to therapy or seeing a mental health practitioner to get better. Eighty-five percent of the psychotropic drugs sold in France are prescribed by general practitioners. That's because general practitioners often prescribe medication themselves to patients who are anxious or depressed rather than send them to a mental health specialist.\n\nDB: You usually go try to find a therapist yourself, simply calling whoever you find on Google, etc. Health insurance providers can help too \u2014 for example, I called mine and they sent me some names. I also asked some friends, and what I've experienced is that once people notice you might need help, they often know someone. Health insurance covers the cost, and you're even allowed to see a therapist/psychiatrist up to five times before you decide to do full therapy with them. So you can try many and see if you get along with them \u2014 and when you've found one, the doctor will fill out all the forms and only then request the actual therapy.\n\nAB: Mental health isn't covered under health insurance here. People pay for their own costs. Certain hospitals do have consultants, but most people get help through private clinics, although there aren't many. People do preliminary Google searches, but again, since there are so few private clinics, there aren't that many search hits. The most common means of finding a therapist is through word of mouth and asking close friends or people you trust.\n\nBaxter: Coverage depends of the type of insurance you buy, but it's rare. In Mexico, people self-medicate all the time. There are indigenous medical treatments that have been around for thousands of years, and also you don't actually have to go to a doctor in order to get medicine. In recent years, the controlled medication law has gotten a bit more strict, but you can still get prescription drugs anywhere.\n\nBS: People normally go to private therapist because it's easier. Normally you ask a friend or a member of your family for a recommendation. A one-hour session with a private therapist typically costs between 50 and 90 euros. You can also go to a doctor covered by Social Insurance, and they can refer you to a therapist. This process is normally very slow, so people often go with the first option instead.\n\nEB: Our health care is free (yay NHS!) and offers access to free counselling, therapy, and treatment. But the waiting list to see a psychotherapist, for instance, is sometimes long and can limit access to care in some situations. In this case, people can see a private therapist if they wish, but it will cost from \u00a340 to \u00a3100 per session. In my experience it's also less likely for someone dealing with mental illness to seek help than it is elsewhere, because it's just not talked about. Brits are difficult when it comes to asking for help with physical illnesses, so opening up to a professional about your mental illness is even more difficult. We're a lot more likely, on the whole, to try to manage it ourselves than we are to go to therapy, but it is definitely available, and more of us should seek it out!\n\nSA: Health insurance in the U.S. is, shall we say, ~complicated~. The implementation of the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, did get more people covered who previously didn't have insurance. All plans in the government's health care \"marketplace\" have to cover mental health. U.S. law also requires what's called \"mental health parity,\" which means insurance providers are supposed to cover mental illnesses the same way they cover physical illnesses (so your copay or deductible to see a mental health specialist should be comparable to the one you pay to see a physical health specialist). This law still doesn't require all providers to offer mental health coverage, just to make it comparable if they do. Even if you have insurance, it's often still hard to access treatment in practice. Navigating the system takes a lot of energy and persistence, which generally isn't easy for someone who's living with mental illness.\n\nWe'd be happy to hear more in the comments about what the mental health situation is like where you live, especially if your country isn't listed here!

And while they are adjusting to a new community, responsibilities, friends, and schedules, some of them will develop anxiety disorders, including OCD, PTSD, panic disorder, and society anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the U.S., affecting 18 percent of the population \u2014 yet only one third of those suffering receive treatment. Many individuals with anxiety disorders are also high achievers, whose mental health disorders are often misdiagnosed \u2014 and worse, often encouraged \u2014 as symptoms of a Type-A personality.\n\nThough many high-achieving anxiety sufferers are able to mask their disorders during childhood or high school, the transition into college and away from the comfort of family can bring these issues to the surface \u2014 and make them suddenly impossible to ignore (according to a recent survey of more than 750 college students with mental illness conducted by the National Alliance for Mental Illness, 64 percent of respondents who had dropped out did so due to mental health issues). For high achievers who may be suffering from an anxiety disorder, here are eight things you need to know \u2014 from two writers who have been there, and can promise there\u2019s a healthier future on the other side.\n\n\n\nI (Caitlin) struggled with anorexia, anxiety, and PTSD during middle school and high school. I had received treatment, but it was always because my parents forced my hand. My disorders were a source of shame for me, so when I relapsed during my freshman year of college, I did everything in my power to hide it. Away from home and my usual support system, my mental health declined rapidly and I eventually suffered a medical emergency due to my eating disorder. My college told me that I needed to receive treatment in order to return for sophomore year and, at that point, I realized that I was going to miss out on amazing opportunities if I didn\u2019t prioritize my mental health. I\u2019m so grateful they intervened, but I wish that I had known it was OK to ask for help the moment I sensed I was headed towards a relapse.\n\n\n\nI (Nile) have suffered from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder for as long as I can remember, characterized by extreme germophobia, intricate rituals, uncontrollable thoughts, and, of course, anxiety. Though these issues plagued me through middle and high school, it wasn\u2019t until college that I hit my breaking point and finally got up the courage to seek professional help. In no uncertain terms, getting into therapy and on medication has changed my life \u2014 though I will always have OCD, I am now functioning at a level that I did not necessarily think would ever be possible. Though I know I wasn\u2019t \u201cready\u201d to seek help earlier, it\u2019s hard to think that I spent so many years suffering in silence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. There's A Difference Between A \"Type A\" Personality & An Anxiety Disorder\n\nThere\u2019s a difference between having a \"Type A\" personality and an anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorders are often mistaken for \u201cnormal\u201d symptoms of \"Type A\" personalities, making it difficult for high achievers (who often also fit this personality style) to realize that they need help. But anxiety disorder goes beyond being intelligent, detail-oriented, and organized \u2014 and should not be ignored. Getting to know the signs of anxiety disorder \u2014 including restlessness, uncontrollable thoughts, sleep issues, and/or feelings of fear, helplessness, and panic \u2014 and separating them from high-achieving characteristics, can help individuals better understand their own mental state.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Experience:\n\nGrowing up, I was always extremely driven, organized, and obsessively achievement-oriented\u2014yet my Type A personality was, in many ways, inextricably tied to my Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. This made it particularly difficult to separate what was attributable to my disorder, and what was attributable to my personality type\u2014and kept me from admitting that I needed help for a long time. By the end of my senior year of high school, I had a 4.8 GPA and was bound for my dream school, UCLA \u2014 but I was also struggling with severe Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, which often inhibited my ability to enjoy daily activities and develop an identity apart from being a straight-A student.\n\nYet I had spent so much time focused on getting to college, that once I was there, I no longer had an excuse to not address my disorder and recognize the issues I had for so long masked as simply another consequence of my Type-A personality. It wasn't until this point, when I was removed from the environment in which I had developed both Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and high-achieving behaviors, that I was able to separate my personality from my disorder, and realize that treating my mental illness would not mean jeopardizing my academic or professional success. \u2014Nile\n\n2. Mental Illness Is Not A Sign Of Weakness Or Failure\n\nJust as certain people are born with a genetic predisposition to diabetes or other chronic physical conditions, some of us are genetically more likely to develop anxiety disorders . Be gentle with yourself and never chalk up your struggle to weakness or inadequacy. When it comes to mental illness, the old adage \u201cpull yourself up by your bootstraps\u201d doesn\u2019t really apply.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Experience:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a perfectionist and high-achiever, I felt incredibly ashamed to admit there was something \u201cwrong\u201d with me and I viewed it as a personal failure that I needed to fix on my own. Needless to say, I couldn\u2019t single-handedly \u201cfix\u201d my anxiety or PTSD on my own, because I required therapy and medication for the disorders. For a long time, I was afraid to seek help because I thought doing so equalled an admission of failure or defeat. In fact, the opposite is true \u2014 facing your illness and accepting the help of doctors, family, and friends is a brave thing to do. \u2014Caitlin\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Acknowledging That You Need Help Is The Most Important Step\n\nAgain, we wouldn\u2019t expect someone with a physical illness to simply \u201cfigure it out\u201d or \u201cfix it\u201d on their own. High achievers often think of themselves as able to handle any problem on their own, and blame it on themselves when they are unable to do so. If you suspect that you have an anxiety disorder, don\u2019t just buy a self-help book and attempt to go it alone. Find a good therapist \u2014 there are a wide variety of anxiety disorders, and it\u2019s important to be assessed by a professional who can properly diagnose you and help you put a treatment plan in place.\n\nMy Experience:\n\n\n\nAnxiety disorders don\u2019t just \u201cgo away\u201d on their own. I knew that I needed help, but I kept putting it off because, in my mind, everything was fine as long as I maintained great grades and engaged in extracurriculars. After I collapsed from malnutrition in my professor\u2019s office, my college told me that I needed to seek treatment. It was humiliating at the time, but it was also the best thing that could have happened to me. Entering therapy finally forced me to confront all the deep-rooted issues that I\u2019d ordered myself to ignore. And, although the medication route isn\u2019t for everyone, I encourage you to be open to considering the idea if your doctor suggests it.\n\nSeeking treatment initially challenged my concept of myself as high achiever, so we addressed it in therapy. It takes strength to admit you need help and work towards recovery, so treatment forced me to reassess my idea of what \"strong\" and \"capable\" meant \u2014 and that was a positive thing for me. I hit rock bottom before I got help in college, but it didn\u2019t have to be that way \u2014 if I had sought help sooner, I would have been spared a lot of unnecessary suffering. I urge anyone who is dealing with anxiety or any mental illness to seek treatment sooner rather than later. Life has so much to offer and you\u2019ll be able to seize the most amazing opportunities if you\u2019re healthy \u2014 and, more importantly, you\u2019ll be able to really enjoy them. \u2014Caitlin\n\n\n\n4. Don't Let Stigma Inhibit Your Recovery\n\nYes, the stigma surrounding mental illness does exist and we all know certain people who may be judgmental \u2014 but you may be surprised about how many others will support you through your recovery. Thanks to the Internet and an increased number of conversations surrounding mental illness, the stigma around these types of disorders is slowly being broken down. So many college students struggle with mental illnesses \u2014 in fact, one in four young adults between the ages of 18 and 24 have a diagnosable condition. If we speak up, we're in a better position to help ourselves and each other. The more comfortable you become in your own skin, the more comfortable your friends and family will become around you.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Experience:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI was afraid that my new college friends would look at me differently or label me as \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201cattention-seeking.\u201d I definitely did not give them enough credit \u2014 they were beyond supportive and my best friend even came to a therapy session with me once so she could chat with me therapist about how best to support me. If a \u201cfriend\u201d judges or gossips about you because of your illness, it\u2019s incredibly hurtful \u2014 but it says everything about their character and nothing about yours. True friends will stick around, support you during rough patches, and recognize that you are an amazing person who is not defined by your illness. \u2014Caitlin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. It's Okay To Open Up At Your Own Speed\n\n\n\nIt can be difficult to find the right time to open up, seek help , or, perhaps the most challenging, admit to yourself that you may be suffering from a mental disorder \u2014 but that's okay, as each individual will hit those markers at a different time. But when you do feel ready, don\u2019t be afraid to open up to your friends or family about what you\u2019re going through. One of the most common surprises experienced by people with mental disorders \u2014 especially something like anxiety, which is extremely common \u2014 is discovering the number of people that have struggled with similar issues. Once you begin to open up, there\u2019s a good chance that other family members or friends will begin to open up as well \u2014 about their own struggles with mental illness. Talking (or, in our case, writing) about mental illness can be incredibly cathartic and therapeutic, and help remedy feelings of loneliness. But you also shouldn\u2019t feel pressured or obligated to share with others; opening up is a process and should be done at your own pace, according to your own comfort level.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Experience:\n\n\n\nIt took me over 10 years to finally acknowledge \u2014 and seek \u2014 help for my OCD, and even longer to open up to those around me about it. But doing so has been immeasurably helpful in my recovery \u2013 after writing about my disorder, I\u2019ve had friends open up about their own mental health struggle, and even received emails from people who identified with things I said. There\u2019s no better feeling than being reminded that you\u2019re not alone, even in this. \u2014Nile\n\n6. Find Healthy Coping Mechanisms\n\nWork with your therapist to come up with a list of coping strategies for the moments and days when your anxiety is taking over. A therapist can also help you identify your triggers, so you can jump into coping mode before you\u2019re hyperventilating and feeling as though the world is about to end. Whether it\u2019s yoga, a walk with a friend, or doing a crossword puzzle, it\u2019s important to find the specific things that work for you; everyone has different triggers, responses, and coping mechanisms, so it\u2019s important to tailor your recovery to your individual experience. High achievers sometimes have a hard time giving ourselves a break in order to engage in self-care \u2014 so it's important to remember that any activity that helps your anxiety is absolutely productive and worth your time. And improving your overall mental health will make it easier to function and thrive in your academic and extracurricular pursuits.\n\n\n\nMy Experience:\n\n\n\nWhen my anxiety took over during freshman year of college, I would hide in my single room and pace in circles anxiously for hours at a time, pull at my hair, and hyperventilate. Needless to say, this pattern of behavior wasn\u2019t especially helpful. My therapist helped me identify my triggers and strategize about how to handle the rough patches. Once I\u2019d opened up to my friends, I felt comfortable asking one or two of them to take a walk outside or sit with me and watch a funny movie. If no one was around at the moment, I learned coping mechanisms that could be done in solitude, such as breathing exercises, journaling, and drawing. It\u2019s not a magical cure and these rough patches will still be tough to navigate, but using coping skills beats the heck out of the alternative. \u2014Caitlin\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Take Recovery Into Your Own Hands\n\nThose with anxiety disorders can often trace the origins to childhood, even if they don\u2019t identify their mental illness and/or seek help until later in life. Yet because anxiety is so deeply rooted and integrated into an individual\u2019s personality and identity, it can be difficult to feel in control of your own recovery. This is especially true for those transitioning from high school to college, whose rituals, comfort zones, and familial enablement may be disrupted when leaving home for the first time. No matter what point in life you\u2019re at, an important step towards recovery is taking accountability for your mental health status. Working towards finding autonomy in your mental health can help take the pressure off the other relationships in your life.\n\n\n\nMy Experience:\n\n\n\nThough I\u2019d been exhibiting signs of OCD since early childhood, I was too embarrassed and scared to ask my parents to get me help \u2013 and too good at hiding my symptoms for my parents to make that decision for me. It wasn\u2019t until I was in college as an adult, and had the ability to really seek help on my own terms \u2013 that I made the decision to finally get the help I desperately needed. It was an empowering experience, and helped me establish this as an individual path to recovery, instead of one dependent solely on the opinions and support of those around me. \u2014Nile\n\n\n\n8. Anxiety & Achievement Is Cyclic\n\nUnfortunately, anxiety is often unconsciously encouraged via positive reinforcement for high-achievement related successes, often in the form of competitive college admissions, awards, recognition, and good grades. For example, if you're staying up all night to perfect a project that then receives an A+, this can incidentally reinforce the negative behaviors that helped you get this positive reaction. In this way, achievement and anxiety can be cyclic \u2014 with high achievers often being caught up on the pattern of unhealthy behavior, successful outcomes, and positive support. Because of the nature of high achievers, this type of anxiety presentation can both be difficult to identify and difficult to change \u2014 but the first step in being able to disrupt the cycle is to recognize it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Experience:\n\n\n\n\n\nYears into my recovery, this cycle is still one of the things I struggle with the most. It\u2019s incredibly difficult to change behaviors that have been encouraged your entire life, and to separate unhealthy achievement behavior from healthy achievement behavior. But it\u2019s a process, and I\u2019ve learned a lot about myself and the ways of working, completing tasks, and scheduling that allow me to be successful while still keeping my anxiety at bay. \u2014Nile\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you arrive at college and find yourself developing symptoms of an anxiety disorder (or relapsing after a period of doing well), don\u2019t hide in silence and shame \u2014 college is an amazing experience and you\u2019ll miss out on so many wonderful opportunities if your mental health is compromised.

Really. And because she is doing so well, she wants to help others who have struggled like she once did when it comes to sharing the same joy. Demi Lovato launched a new mental health campaign to help raise awareness and also to take away the negative stigma that often accompanies mental health issues. And since she has overcome struggles that fit this description, it is personal for her. She told People,\n\n\n\nI'm living well with my mental illness \u2014 I am actually functioning like a very happy person would. I couldn't be happier today. Life is really, really great. I have a brand-new puppy and I'm able to not only take care of myself but take care of him as well. I'm living my dream. Life is pretty amazing.\n\n\n\nThe singer, who announced her partnership with five mental health organizations, called Be Vocal: Speak Up for Mental Health on May 28, was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in the past. Now, she has opened up about how she was able to pursue her dreams and be the best performer she could be despite her diagnosis. Of course, this is far from the first time the 22-year-old has opened up about her struggles. She has long been a champion for raising awareness about different mental health issues, and has also spoken frankly about her struggles with an eating disorder. But this time, she is not only taking an activist approach, but inspiring others to become activists, as well.\n\n\n\nAs part of the campaign, Lovato is encouraging others to speak out about their mental health and help them improve access to treatments in their own communities by suggesting they write letters to Congress. The Camp Rock star revealed that her father suffered from schizophrenia as well as bipolar disorder, and that she had to watch him lead a very sad life due to lack of access to treatment and help. Sadly enough, if others see people with mental illnesses not doing well, they may assume that everyone with an issue is beyond help, which is, of course, not the case.\n\n\n\nAs Lovato has clearly shown with her great success, it is absolutely possible to thrive despite having a mental illness. And since she has such a wide platform, she can lead this campaign more successfully than the everyday person could. But, as she clearly recognizes, only if enough everyday people speak out about mental illness, can a major difference be made.

In my life, I have dealt with anorexia nervosa, orthorexia, exercise addiction and immense body shame. I have been underweight. I have nearly passed out at the gym more times than I can count. I have abused my body in more ways than one. I have spent hundreds of hours with therapists, doctors, nurses, psychiatrists, dietitians. I spent years living a numb, gray, miserable life, feeling like I had been visited by a Dementor from Harry Potter. And I have recovered \u2014 gaining back my weight, my life, my happiness and becoming a (non-diet) Registered Dietitian myself.\n\nToday, I spend much of my time spreading awareness through my blog and my Instagram, and I regularly come into contact with people who make it clear to me that our society still does not understand eating disorders. So to help, I have compiled a collection of eating disorder myths that I think need to be busted ASAP.\n\nEating Disorders Are Not Dependent On Size\n\nYou can be a size 00 with an eating disorder or you can be a size 28 with an eating disorder \u2014 and your size does not determine the severity or \u201ctype\u201d eating disorder. Don\u2019t assume that someone who is in a bigger body suffers from binge eating and don\u2019t assume that someone in a smaller body has anorexia. Weight stigma is something that our culture teaches us from a young age, and one of the most common misconceptions about eating disorders is that they have to look a certain way.\n\nAnd believing that to be true is not necessarily our fault; ever since health class in grade school, we have been told that all people with anorexia are skeletal-looking, with dry hair and cracked skin. That image is sold to us everywhere in our society. Just look at the pictures that accompany most articles on eating disorders \u2014 a black and white photo of a skeletal woman hunched in the corner or a bigger woman looking guiltily at a cupcake. That is not the reality of most eating disorders. As the Center for Eating Disorders says, \"the bottom line is that you cannot define someone\u2019s health by how much they weigh and you cannot determine whether they have an eating disorder just by looking at them.\"\n\nEven though my eating disorder was screaming at me not to, I told the resident there about the problems I was having with food. But when the doctor came in, there was no mention of them. Not a word.\n\nAnd this isn\u2019t just a problem in our society \u2014 it\u2019s a problem in the medical community. As someone who suffered from anorexia, my eating disorder was not taken seriously for years because I was not significantly underweight. When things started to get bad, I tried to reach out to my doctor. Even though my eating disorder was screaming at me not to, I told the resident there about the problems I was having with food. But when the doctor came in, there was no mention of them. Not a word.\n\nAs she started to walk out of the room after my appointment, I sheepishly stammered out, \u201cDid um...the resident uh\u2026tell you about my eating thing?\u201d to which she responded, \u201cOh yeah, just don\u2019t lose any more weight, you\u2019re fine.\u201d And this was said to someone who was underweight. Think about all the women and men in bigger bodies who have eating disorders \u2014 they suddenly lose a lot of weight but instead of concern, they\u2019re met with praise. No one questions it when they \u201cneeded\u201d to lose the weight, which is why it is so important to find medical professionals who understand and ideally have a background in eating disorder treatment. Fortunately, there are organizations that are dedicated to helping people find treatment teams and other professionals in their area \u2014 like this help finder from Recovery Warriors. The fact is anorexia, bulimia, binge-eating and eating disorders not otherwise specified can look different on every body. What determines eating disorders is not weight; it is your actions and behaviors around food.\n\nEating Disorders Don\u2019t Discriminate About Race Or Socioeconomic Status\n\nFor so long, eating disorders in general (and anorexia particular) have been considered a sickness for wealthy, typically young white girls (insert eye roll here). Television is filled with characters that fit this mold \u2014 think Emma from Degrassi , Cassie from Skins and Hannah from Pretty Little Liars. A quick Google image search of eating disorders yields thousands of pictures of young white women (note: do not do this if you yourself have suffered and could be triggered).\n\nThe idea that eating disorders are just for straight, white women is one that desperately needs to be put to rest.\n\nIn reality, eating disorders do not discriminate; they do not care about your race, ethnicity or socioeconomic status. A 2013 study showed that Latina and Asian women are more likely to report body dissatisfaction than white women and information from University of Chapel Hill shows members of the LGBTQ+ community are more likely to develop anorexia and bulimia than people who identify as heterosexual. The idea that eating disorders are just for straight, white women is one that desperately needs to be put to rest.\n\nIn fact, the National Eating Disorder Association has a whole section of their website devoted to diversity in eating disorders. A quick glance and it will become clear to you that not all people who suffer from eating disorders are rich, young white women. Eating disorders affect people with bodies of all different colors, from all different backgrounds and with all different stories. Anorexia is not just for \u201cwhite girls trying to look better\u201d and similarly, those with binge eating disorder are not just \u201clazy\u201d and those with bulimia are not just \u201cgoing through a phase\u201d. Eating disorders are real, they are serious and they need to be talked about in a way that honors that.\n\nEating Disorders Are Not Here To Be The Butt Of Your Jokes\n\nThey are also not here for hyperbole. Saying that you \"binged\" last night because you ate slightly more than usual is not a true binge \u2014 and spreading the message that it is is dangerous and confusing for those people who truly do suffer from binge eating. Joking that you\u2019re just going to lose the weight by \u201cturning bulimic\u201d reinforces the false idea that being bulimic (or having any eating disorder or mental illness) is a choice. People with eating disorders don\u2019t suddenly \u201cdecide\u201d that they are going to have one; it\u2019s a mental illness and like all mental illnesses, it\u2019s not something that can be chosen.\n\nLikewise, joking that you\u2019re just going to \u201cstop eating\u2019 is not clever or cute or funny. These kinds of statements are dangerous and normalize eating disorder behavior that has already become so normalized in our society. So many eating disorder behaviors are considered standard, praised even, in our \u201chealth\u201d-obsessed culture \u2014 small portions, hours at the gym, obsessing over our weight. All of this reinforces the idea that the \"right\" thing to do is spend our days in the gym, cut out many foods from our diet and eat smaller meals \u2014 actions which, to any eating disorder professional, are cause for concern. But all of these things have been established as normal to some extent in our society. We do not need any more conversation that\u2019s going to contribute to that idea.\n\nSo what can we do? What can we do, as people and as a society, to talk about eating disorders?\n\nFirst and foremost, if you think you have a problem with food, think you\u2019re using unhealthy behaviors, or feel like your relationship to food or your body is \u201coff\u201d \u2014 get help. The National Eating Disorder Association has a screening tool on their website that takes less than three minutes and can evaluate your risk for an eating disorder. They also have links to get help and find treatment near you. No matter what you\u2019re dealing with, you are always worthy of getting help.\n\nThe second thing we can do is stop glamorizing eating disorders. We can stop telling people that they are \u201cso good\u201d when they eat little or skip dessert. We can stop congratulating weight loss. We can stop praising people for spending hours at the gym or following whatever diet is trending. We can stop demonizing foods, so that when we see a celebrity eating a cookie, it doesn\u2019t have to be a big deal worthy of tabloid coverage. We can stop congratulating each other on \u201cwillpower\u201d if we refuse a donut in the breakroom. During my training to become a dietitian, I saw other professionals praising clients who ate smaller meals, cut out sugar and dedicated themselves to \"clean\" eating. But there is an abundance of research that shows approaching health and diet with a Health at Every Size perspective, which stresses intuitive eating, body trust and embodiment, leads to better health outcomes than the dangerous dieting fads that are so often splayed on the cover of magazines. Instead of approaching people who are skipping meals or obsessed with what their body looks like with accolades, we can start approaching them with gentle concern and compassion.\n\nLastly, we can invite people with stories to come forward and share them without judgement or criticism. Eating disorders are still considered a taboo topic. When I share with others that I have dealt with an eating disorder in my past, I can often see them visibly trying to figure out how to react or what to say. And it\u2019s not their fault \u2014 we live in a culture that has such a stigma surrounding mental illness, we still don\u2019t know how to talk about it in a helpful or productive way. As someone who has publicly shared her story through Instagram and blogging, I also know how cruel people can be \u2014 trolls have told me that I recovered \u201cwrong\u201d or that I looked better before. They\u2019re a product of our thin-obsessed culture but that means it is more important than ever to keep talking about it. If we stop talking about it now, they\u2019ll never stop and we\u2019ll never advance our understanding of eating disorders as a society.\n\nAnd if you haven\u2019t suffered from an eating disorder, try to stop using language that reinforces the stigma around them. Do a little research into eating disorders or recovery stories if you\u2019re interested. Let\u2019s continue to use our voices, share our stories (and the stories of others) and bring eating disorders into the light.\n\nImage: Pexels", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/201496-a-registered-dietitian-eating-disorder-survivor-debunks-these-eating-disorder-myths", "summary": "It\u2019s National Eating Disorder Awareness week and as a dietitian and an eating disorder recovery advocate, I have a lot to say about eating disorders and the way our society talks about them.\nSo to help, I have compiled a collection of eating disorder myths that I think need to be busted ASAP.\nEating Disorders Are Not Dependent On SizeYou can be a size 00 with an eating disorder or you can be a size 28 with an eating disorder \u2014 and your size does not determine the severity or \u201ctype\u201d eating disorder.\nIn fact, the National Eating Disorder Association has a whole section of their website devoted to diversity in eating disorders.\nThe National Eating Disorder Association has a screening tool on their website that takes less than three minutes and can evaluate your risk for an eating disorder.", "timescraped": 1513838510.0853372, "category": {"words": 1780, "personal": 67, "thirdperson": 23, "condition": 4, "recovery": 3}}, "affd114d114c735a930958f1d2504072": {"title": "What's The Difference Between Bipolar & Borderline Personality Disorder?", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost%2F2016%2F9%2F13%2F8fa77802-4095-44f7-883c-b019b111c16f.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "text": "On the surface, it might seem like there's not too much of a difference between bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder. Both mental health disorders can involve mood shifts and problems with impulse control \u2014 so much so that even doctors in a clinical setting can sometimes have a difficult time telling the two disorders apart when making an initial diagnosis. Though bipolar disorder involves a series of manic or depressive \"mood episodes,\" while borderline personality disorder is more about an ongoing pattern of behavior, the extreme ups and downs that sufferers of both disorders must deal with can make them look awfully similar from the outside. If you have questions about a loved one's unpredictable moods \u2014 or even your own \u2014 you might have a hard time figuring out which disorder seems more applicable to your situation.\n\nWhile they have many similar elements, bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder are different disorders \u2014 and their differences are important. Understanding those differences is most important, of course, in making sure sufferers get the right treatment. Managing bipolar disorders (which include bipolar I & bipolar II, as well as cyclothymic disorder) involves different medications and therapeutic techniques than managing borderline personality disorder, and undergoing psychological treatment for a different mental health condition than the one you have can cause a lot of problems \u2014 for instance, antidepressants can actually make some people suffering from bipolar disorder feel worse.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding these differences is important for people who don't suffer from either of the disorders too; it helps us understand how complex mental health is, and how complicated it can be to find and get the right treatment. What someone dealing with a mental health issue seems to be going through is only part of the story, and people who appear to be battling the same symptoms can be dealing with very different problems inside. Knowing this can help us become more understanding, more empathetic, and (perhaps most importantly) more likely to believe people struggling with mental illness when they tell us what it feels like.\n\n1. Each Disorder's Depression Feels Different\n \nPeople dealing with borderline personality disorder and people dealing with bipolar disorder will both sometimes suffer through periods of intense depression. However, the details of each kind of depression are different. According to a 2014 article published in Current Opinion In Psychiatry, \"in contrast to 'typical' depressive features (e.g. decreased self-esteem, self-criticism) frequently associated with BP II, BPD depressive states are often more characterized by emptiness, shame and 'painful incoherence'.\" (As per the article, the \"painful incoherence\" that many depressed BPD sufferers feel is \"emotional pain related to a fragmented sense of self.\")\n\nThis means that while depressive periods for sufferers of both disorders may involve common elements, like changes to sleeping habits or appetites, they lead to different kinds of feelings. A person dealing with bipolar disorder may spend their depressive episode feeling guilty and thinking about perceived past mistakes, while a person with borderline personality disorder may experience depression as more of an abstract feeling that also includes elements of anger and frustration.\n\nA report published in the Israeli medical journal Harefuah also found \"BPD patients reporting higher levels of cognitive and anxiety-related symptoms\" than patients with bipolar disorder during depressive periods, further painting a picture of a different kind of depression than what's usually associated with bipolar disorder.\n\n2. BPD Is More Constant Than Bipolar Disorder\n\nBPD and bipolar disorder are so often mistaken for each other because of the way that the two disorders cause a sufferer to shift between moods. But the way the disorders actually play out in the sufferer's life is different. While folks who have bipolar disorder experience depressive and manic or hypomanic episodes, they also experience periods where they are not undergoing any kind of episode, and feel that they are at an emotional \"baseline.\" In contrast, borderline personality disorder doesn't afflict sufferers on an episode-by-episode basis; that disorder's impact on the sufferer's life is more consistent.\n\n\n\nAs Lecia Bushak wrote in a 2015 piece for Medical Daily:\n\n\"Experts note that one of the main differentiating factors between bipolar and borderline personality disorder is that symptoms of personality disorder are pretty consistent and ongoing, while people with bipolar disorder appear to have 'breaks' between their extreme mood swings, in which they experience a mid-range mood where most of the symptoms that are confusing between the two disorders (impulsivity, anger, irritability, extreme emotion) aren\u2019t present.\"\n\nSo while a person with bipolar disorder will likely experience a period of time in which their disorder won't necessarily guide their feelings or daily life, a person with borderline personality disorder feels the impact of their disease most of the time.\n\n3. BPD Has More To Do With Interpersonal Relationships\n\nOne of the key differences between these two disorders is the role that other people play in them. Bipolar symptoms can manifest in the total absence of interpersonal interaction; though some mood episodes will be triggered by a stressful or emotionally loaded interaction with another person, mood episodes can also come seemingly out of nowhere \u2014 a product of pure biochemistry.\n\nConversely, borderline personality disorder is a disease that has a lot to do with how the sufferer interacts with others (in addition to how the sufferer views themselves). According to Current Opinion In Psychiatry, \"Individuals with BP II are more likely than those with BPD to have autonomous mood episodes and lacking an interpersonal context...By contrast, symptoms of BPD are usually reactive, generally triggered by a psychologically salient interpersonal event such as frustration, rejection or a sense of abandonment.\" Or, as author Randi Kreger put it in Psychology Today, \"The moods in people with BPD are more dependent, either positively or negatively, on what's going on in their life at the moment\" than those of people with bipolar disorders. While bipolar disorders are diagnosed by a pattern of mood episodes, borderline personality disorder is diagnosed by a consistent pattern of behavior that involves, according to the National Institute of Mental Health, \"A pattern of intense and stormy relationships\" and \"Extreme reactions\u2014including panic, depression, rage, or frantic actions\u2014to abandonment, whether real or perceived.\"\n\nHow Can I Make Sure I'm Getting The Right Diagnosis?\n\nObviously, a psychologist who's been through medical school knows more about diagnosing mental illnesses than a random blogger like myself. But if you or a loved one has been diagnosed with one of these disorders, and you feel like something's a bit off \u2014 for instance, if you've been diagnosed with a bipolar disorder, but you feel like your mood shifts are always the result of an emotional interaction with another person, don't be afraid to ask for additional testing. You spend every day in your own skin, and you may notice things that your clinician misses.

The best things really do take time.\n\nI have suffered with an eating disorder for over six years, and only in the last year did I begin to realize what a toll it was taking on my life and happiness. It\u2019s only once I began to truly recover that I realized all the things the process has taught me (albeit under the most unfortunate circumstances). Here are seven life lessons that I learned (and am still learning) from my battle with anorexia.\n\nI first started engaging in eating disorder behaviors in the first couple years of high school. I am only now starting to truly recover at age 22. For me, it feels like I\u2019ve been on this journey for far longer. At times, it has reduced me to nothing but a shadow of my true self. It has made me feel small; it has shrunk me down both physically and mentally.\n\nAs I\u2019ve embraced the recovery process, I\u2019ve seen parts of my life come back that I forgot existed. I am slowly gaining pieces of life back. As with most worthwhile endeavors in this life, I can tell the road is long but the reward is worth it.\n\n\n\n2. Sometimes healthcare professionals don't know best.\n\nI have a great deal of respect for those in the healthcare profession. But the truth is, when it comes to eating disorders, they don\u2019t always know best. Eating disorders are very specific and complex. Even today, they are far from fully understood. It is imperative during recovery to seek professional help through the recovery process with therapists, dietitians, doctors, psychiatrists, and whomever else your journey may require. However, it is important that you find professionals who understand, or hopefully specialize in, eating disorders.\n\nAlthough you may not agree with everything they have to say, you have to find someone with whom you are comfortable speaking openly about your eating disorder with. This is essential to the recovery process. I say this because I legitimately once had a doctor tell me, \u201cwell, you sure don\u2019t look anorexic!\u201d This was the epitome of unhelpful.\n\nBottom line: find professionals you like. Find professionals you trust. Listen to their advice, be open and be willing to make changes. But at the end of the day, your recovery needs to feel right to you. Trust yourself (as long as you are indeed honoring your recovery and not your eating disorder).\n\n3. You need to give yourself permission.\n\nThis is perhaps the biggest lesson I have learned throughout my eating disorder, and one that I\u2019m still learning every day. No one is going to give you permission to recover. No one is going to give you permission to eat the pizza. No one is going to give you permission to buy three pints of ice cream when it\u2019s on sale (which I did this week, by the way). No one is going to give you permission to take a break from exercising. No one is going to give you permission to eat two dinners. And even if they do, you won\u2019t listen.\n\nYou need to grant yourself that permission. You need to find it within yourself to give yourself permission to do everything recovery entails. You can spend a lot of time looking for permission in other places \u2014 or you can save yourself some time and grant it to yourself.\n\n\n\n4. You have to make it happen every day.\n\nRecovery is not something that \"happens\" to you. You do not get to recovery by mere happenstance. Recovery is a decision, and one that you have to make every single day. In my case, it took months and months of a sort of \u201cquasi-recovery\u201d before I could finally commit myself fully to eating disorder recovery.\n\nThe decision was liberating. I sat in my bed, crying \u2014 because I was done, and because I was just beginning. Since that day, things haven\u2019t gotten magically easier. I make the decision to recover every day, just as I did on that first day. It\u2019s hard, but it\u2019s also incredibly powerful. It\u2019s not enough to simply decide; recovery, as I'm learning, takes hard work and determination.\n\n\n\n5. You cannot please everyone.\n\nI am a people-pleaser. It is both my greatest blessing and my fatal flaw. My whole life, I have always strived to make everyone in my life happy. Not just the people closest to me \u2014 my family, my boyfriend, my best friends \u2014 but everyone. Sometimes, this can work to my advantage. It enables me to be a good friend, a hard worker, and a pleasant person to be around.\n\nBut when it comes to body shape and size, aiming to please others simply is not healthy. In a world where thinness is idolized and thigh gaps are sought after, you simply cannot live to please everyone else. And you have to accept that. Striving to please everyone will only result in disappointment, frustration, and ultimately, failure.\n\n6. You need to be your own top priority.\n\nPutting others first has always been my approach to life. For all of you out there who are also the caretakers, the \u201cmom\u201d of your friend group, the ones who strive to make sure everyone is taken care of before you think about yourself: I see you and I am with you. But as I began the recovery process, I learned that I needed to make myself my number-one priority.\n\nRecovery is a long process, and it is not something that can be done passively. It is something that you must take an active role in to be successful, and something that you need to work at all day, every day. In order to do this, you need to put yourself first. You need to put your meal plan first, you need to put your own mental health first, and you need to make sure that all your needs are being met in order to stay true to your process. Although putting yourself first might feel all kinds of wrong, it is imperative to your recovery.\n\n\n\n7. You have to trust the process.\n\nThe process of recovering from an eating disorder is long, exhausting, frustrating, empowering, liberating, and a million other things all wrapped into one. There will be days you feel like you are doing great, and there will be days that you feel so down, you can\u2019t imagine ever getting better. Recovering takes trusting yourself and trusting your body to do what\u2019s right, and that\u2019s terrifying for anyone who has ever suffered from an eating disorder. You need to trust your body and you need to trust that the process is going to help get you to that place you really want to be.\n\nThat's what I trust, anyway.\n\nEditor's note: If you're struggling with body image or an eating disorder, know you're not alone, and help is available.\n\n\n\nImages: Pexels; Giphy", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/144097-7-lessons-im-learning-from-my-eating-disorder-recovery", "summary": "I first started engaging in eating disorder behaviors in the first couple years of high school.\nIt is imperative during recovery to seek professional help through the recovery process with therapists, dietitians, doctors, psychiatrists, and whomever else your journey may require.\nThis is perhaps the biggest lesson I have learned throughout my eating disorder, and one that I\u2019m still learning every day.\nIn my case, it took months and months of a sort of \u201cquasi-recovery\u201d before I could finally commit myself fully to eating disorder recovery.\nEditor's note: If you're struggling with body image or an eating disorder, know you're not alone, and help is available.", "timescraped": 1513838512.8745222, "category": {"words": 1132, "personal": 32, "thirdperson": 5, "condition": 1, "recovery": 13}}, "8a7e474389c33fd3f55e645ab98ef65f": {"title": "Why Britney Spears & Other Celebs Shouldn't Have To Talk About Mental Health With The Public", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost/2016/9/13/6b03197b-42f9-410d-a9b7-795fd9249d6d.jpg?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "text": "It's like 2001 all over again: Britney Spears' mental health is making headlines. After a series of videos showed her looking vibrant on stage at her Las Vegas residency for the first time in, oh, years, commentators started to look back on what once went wrong in Spears-world. We were all there for the \"breakdown\" \u2014 the head-shaving, the screaming, the weird British accent \u2014 but there's never been any public explanation for her psychological downfall. Surely, some people are saying, it's time for Spears, and other celebs who've appeared to suffer mental health issues, to be open with the public?\n\nNot necessarily. I'm delighted every time a celebrity feels brave and healthy enough to talk about their mental health struggles: Demi Lovato, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Jared Padalecki all earn my respect and millions of high fives. That is some hard sh*t. But I feel like making demands on celebrities to \"come out\" as mentally ill is not the right way forward. It's an intensely personal choice, and yet somehow parts of the public feel deceived that they don't get a full run-down of Britney's diagnosis, medication, and therapy regime. What?!\n\nIt's not in our current attitude towards celebrity to allow privacy or unspoken struggles. If they are suffering, we demand that they come out afterwards with a \"My Private Pain\" cover on People. But I believe mental illness should be an exception. Here's why.\n\n1. All Secrets Are Not The Same\n\nKevin Winter/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nIt's an easy, lazy parallel to make: celebrities who've been hiding their sexuality for fear of career stigma have begun to come out, and make a positive impact on wider cultural acceptance of LGBT life. Why shouldn't celebs with mental health issues \"come out\" for the same reasons? (Never mind that LGBT people don't have an \"obligation\" to come out either.)\n\nThe parallel, however, doesn't work. To be LGBT is intrinsically a matter of identity; mental illness is a matter of health. Indeed, \"I am not my depression/bipolar disorder/etcetera\" is a key mantra for many people with mental illnesses. More importantly, however, visibility \u2014 becoming a high-profile example of something, and therefore normalizing it \u2014 can't be applied as a universal good to all stigmatized elements of life. We shouldn't demand blanket confessional rules for celebrities who've been raped, were badly treated as children, did drugs, or suffered miscarriages, to name a few: every situation is different, and being open about it is an individual's personal choice, often after significant private healing. And in some cases, as I'll talk about in a bit, visibility may come at too high a cost.\n\n2. Celebrities Don't Actually Owe Us Anything\n\nSTR/AFP/Getty Images\n\nI have a fascination with vintage gossip: the Old Hollywood time before tabloids and E!, when studios rather than paparazzi ruled the media narrative, and old-school celebrity reportage maintained a certain distance in discussing personal lives. It wasn't a more authentic time, or even a preferable one (though I could do less with knowing about the Kardashians' UTIs), but it's important to realize that we haven't always demanded that celebrities show us every wart and flaw. It's a modern condition.\n\nThe tables have turned: from once feeling privileged to get any glimpse inside the lives of the famous, we've now become voracious and critical if we suspect them of hiding anything. We've transformed into annoyed parents who resent their teenagers for having secrets and intimate unseen lives. Don't they know we made them? Getting frustrated if you suspect a celebrity is hiding details of a mental illness is part of this feeling, and it needs to be examined. Why should they tell you, a person they don't know, about an intimate and damaging part of their lives? Why do you feel they should?\n\n3. The Health Costs May Outweigh The Visibility Benefits\n\nKevin Winter/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nThere are some instances where a public revelation of mental illness has been met with overwhelming positivity. Celebs, after all, have fans who wish them well, and the outpouring of support after mental illness revelations (like the river of lights for depression sufferer Jared Padalecki at Comic Con) can surely be seriously helpful for somebody suffering from a very personal, difficult illness.\n\nBut that's the problem: coming out may not be the best thing for a celebrity's mental health. You'll often find that celebs discuss their mental health issues after they've undergone a period of recovery, where it's easier to maintain distance and draw healthy boundaries on what they want to discuss. Those who do disclose details while a serious episode is happening tend to use it to explain mysterious public absences \u2014 not for its own sake.\n\nLet's outline the likely risks of a mental health revelation by a celebrity: they'll face misunderstanding and a high likelihood of being viciously trolled; they'll likely feel obliged or pressured into talking about it repeatedly; they'll be told they're privileged and should stop complaining; their professional competency will be questioned; and they'll probably feel highly vulnerable and exposed. Essentially it sounds like the worst thing for possible treatment. Ever.\n\n4. The Responsibility To Be A Role Model May Be Crippling\n\nJason Merritt/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nIf you're already suffering from mental illness, the added pressure of being a \"poster child\" for that illness \u2014 because, after all, your name will come up when the condition is Googled \u2014 must be absolutely immense. If it's something like depression, which can stem from a perverse and self-damaging desire to be perfect, the results could be seriously damaging. Can you imagine trying to be Little Miss Perfect at having a mental illness as well as at everything else?\n\nBeing in the public eye likely isn't great for the mentally ill anyway. So much pressure! But if they choose to keep doing their jobs and enjoying their lives while privately seeking help, surely that's a healthy choice. They aren't obliged to help mental health visibility or share their struggles, and it may better if they don't. Either way? It's their prerogative.", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/104948-why-britney-spears-other-celebs-shouldnt-have-to-talk-about-mental-health-with-the", "summary": "It's like 2001 all over again: Britney Spears' mental health is making headlines.\nSurely, some people are saying, it's time for Spears, and other celebs who've appeared to suffer mental health issues, to be open with the public?\nWhy shouldn't celebs with mental health issues \"come out\" for the same reasons?\nBut that's the problem: coming out may not be the best thing for a celebrity's mental health.\nCan you imagine trying to be Little Miss Perfect at having a mental illness as well as at everything else?", "timescraped": 1513838514.1248078, "category": {"words": 1039, "personal": 16, "thirdperson": 32, "condition": 17, "recovery": 0}}, "36d986ab7eb12b9e11cfa7d94343d99a": {"title": "Star Vella Lovell Says \u2018Crazy Ex-Girlfriend\u2019 Season 3's Mental Health Storyline Shows There\u2019s No Wrong Way To Support A Friend", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/uploads/image/2017/12/8/916f8fa8-1a14-4696-b7eb-c76e326669e5-ceg210b_0097b.jpg?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "text": "Over the past few episodes, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend has delved deeper into Rebecca Bunch's (Rachel Bloom) mental illness. But as the CW series has fearlessly followed its lead character as she hit rock bottom and begins to recover with a brand new borderline personality disorder diagnosis, it's not leaving the struggles of the people who love her behind. Crazy Ex-Girlfriend Season 3 is doing its part to strip away some of the fear that comes along with supporting a friend who's going through a tough mental health issue. According to star Vella Lovell, who plays Heather, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend isn't providing any answers as to the \"correct\" reaction to a suicide attempt like Rebecca's, because there simply aren't any.\n\n\"There\u2019s no right way to handle this,\" she says, speaking over the phone in early December. \"No one else can do that journey for Rebecca. As much as her friends want to help, it\u2019s her journey.\"\n\nBecause of the stigma that surrounds the topic, people may not feel qualified or prepared to step up and help a loved one, even if their situation is less extreme than Rebecca's. And of course they're balancing that desire to help with their own human response. Per Australia's Suicide Hotline Victoria, common reactions to a loved one's suicide attempt include anger, shame, guilt, fear, avoidance, and minimization.\n\nRobert Voets/The CW\n\nYou can see many of those emotions in Rebecca's friends in the episode that tackles the aftermath of her suicide attempt. Josh feels shame, because he thinks it was his fault. Paula is afraid to leave Rebecca alone for a even a few minutes. Nathaniel avoids seeing or talking to her because he's processing some repressed memories of a similar incident with his mom. And Valencia and Heather are throwing themselves into their own projects \u2014 a social media campaign and a relationship, respectively.\n\nLovell says that there was a scene cut from the \"Josh Is Irrelevant\" episode where Valencia calls out Heather for using her budding romance with Hector to distance herself from what was happening with Rebecca. It's the same thing Heather accused Valencia of doing with her social media campaign \u2014 sorry, her \"movement.\"\n\n\"She\u2019s almost just as distracted as Valencia is, just in a different way. It\u2019s hard to fully experience when a friend is going through [a mental health crisis] in such an intense way, so you maybe fall back on your own coping mechanisms, which I think for Heather is to detach,\" says the actor. But she brings up the moment when Rebecca takes too long in the bathroom and Heather is ready to break down the door with her emergency ax as proof that \"when push comes to shove, Heather will be there.\"\n\n\"It takes kind of a second for her to activate sometimes,\" Lovell says. \"That moment with the ax, she\u2019s like, 'I will cut the door down. I didn\u2019t know we were at that point.'\"\n\nThat ride-or-die friendship between Rebecca and the rest of her girls has manifested in some bizarre and heartwarming ways, setting up a soft place for Rebecca to land when she stumbles. To Lovell, the formation of the show's \"gurlgroup4evah\" has been \"an unexpected delight,\" especially since none of the four women had previously known the benefits of having a tight group of supportive ladies.\n\nMike Yarish/The CW\n\n\"You think [the show] is about this love triangle or this romantic comedy, and this odd, beautiful, strong female friendship has emerged,\" she says. \"I think females supporting other females is incredibly important, and we have to do that for each other. Especially with the current climate, if we don\u2019t do that for each other... people aren\u2019t going to make room for that if we don\u2019t do it ourselves.\"\n\nSpeaking of the climate, I have to ask Lovell about the strangely prescient timing of the show's season premiere and its big number, \"Let's Generalize About Men.\" On Oct. 5, The New York Times published a piece reporting on several accusations of sexual assault and harassment spanning decades levied against Hollywood executive Harvey Weinstein that would prove to be a tipping point for society's desire to expose and punish accused predators. On Oct. 13, a new episode of Crazy Ex-Girlfriend aired, ending with a Pointer Sisters-inspired music video wherein the four core women \"take one bad thing about one man and apply it to all of them.\" In addition to being a total earworm, the song seemed to parallel the #metoo movement and near-daily news of women speaking out (and finally being heard) regarding their abuse at the hands of powerful men in show business, politics, tech, and big business.\n\nracheldoesstuff on YouTube\n\n\"There was this collective urge in America to generalize about men, and to be like, 'Are you serious? This one too?'\" Lovell says, adding that the show's musical comedy medium allows them to contribute to discourse in an interesting and unexpected way. It's fine by her if the '80s homage has become a rallying cry for women who are just done. \"There\u2019s a real urge in times like that to just lump [men] all together and let your rage out,\" she says. And if you can do it in coordinated, shoulder-padded neon skirt suits, all the better.\n\nThe occasional rage-fest has to be healthy for Heather, who isn't known for expressing many emotions. But Season 3 has challenged her to \"actively participate in her life and really be present,\" according to the actor. There's more to come there in the second half of the season. Lovell promises a lot of \"growing up\" for Heather, following her being officially being kicked out of the community college she's taken comfort in being a perpetual student at, and, of course, helping Rebecca through her recovery.\n\nHer big number so far this year was the inspirational musical theater song, \"The Moment Is Me,\" which was deliberately the complete opposite of the kind of music the audience can imagine Heather being interested in. Lovell loves the \"push and pull\" of Heather's relationship to the world. \"You can\u2019t be over everything in your own life or you won\u2019t ever do anything,\" she says. Yet Heather's deadpan personality means she's never going to look as jazzed about life as those musical-theater dancers leaping behind her in her pivotal song.\n\nThe CW Television Network on YouTube\n\nStill, Lovell talks about Rebecca's tumultuous arrival in West Covina as the first push Heather had to really think about her life and how she's been living it \"a little outside herself.\" So it's not surprising that her roommate feels the kind of affection for Rebecca that leads to her brandishing a lethal weapon at a bathroom door. Through their friendship and others, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend is going to keep chipping away at the emotional and mental barriers that can hold people back from truly connecting with their friends whenever things get bad.\n\nIf you or someone you know are experiencing suicidal thoughts, call 911, or call the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 1-800-273-8255.", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/p/star-vella-lovell-says-crazy-ex-girlfriend-season-3s-mental-health-storyline-shows-theres-no-wrong-way-to-support-a-friend-7519739", "summary": "Over the past few episodes, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend has delved deeper into Rebecca Bunch's (Rachel Bloom) mental illness.\nCrazy Ex-Girlfriend Season 3 is doing its part to strip away some of the fear that comes along with supporting a friend who's going through a tough mental health issue.\nAccording to star Vella Lovell, who plays Heather, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend isn't providing any answers as to the \"correct\" reaction to a suicide attempt like Rebecca's, because there simply aren't any.\nAnd Valencia and Heather are throwing themselves into their own projects \u2014 a social media campaign and a relationship, respectively.\nThrough their friendship and others, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend is going to keep chipping away at the emotional and mental barriers that can hold people back from truly connecting with their friends whenever things get bad.", "timescraped": 1513838515.4819882, "category": {"words": 1182, "personal": 8, "thirdperson": 43, "condition": 4, "recovery": 1}}, "af4441e05f7e9ca9b8665f6ba522d559": {"title": "Kesha Wrote An Essay For Anyone Dealing With Depression Or Anxiety This Holiday Season", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/uploads/getty/2017/12/1/a8875379-c065-4255-8b4b-fc194ffd7af4-getty-881370054.jpg?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "text": "For many people struggling emotionally, with their personal lives, or with mental illness, the holiday season can be a source of major anxiety. Because of this, Kesha wrote an essay about the holidays for TIME in which she encourages others with mental health issues to take care of themselves this holiday season. With so many people living with depression, anxiety, addiction issues, and fraught family relationships, it\u2019s important to remember that sometimes the best gift you can give your loved ones is a healthier, authentic you.\n\nThe \"Praying\" singer believes that the pressure people feel to be merry and to be generous with their time, money, and thoughtfulness, can have the opposite effect on people going through a tough time. \"All those plans and expectations of joy can turn tougher than they sound,\" she writes. \"This is especially true for those of us who struggle with mental illness.\" As a result Kesha, who has been open about her struggles with an eating disorder, has developed her own way of coping with her anxiety around the holidays. She writes:\n\nI often feel like I\u2019m supposed to be everywhere, with everyone \u2014 all with the added guilt that it\u2019s the season of giving. To fight this, I\u2019ve developed a mantra: It\u2019s not selfish to take time for yourself.\n\nDavid Becker/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nThe Grammy-nominated artist developed this mantra after her personal troubles came to a head one December. The pop star writes, \"It was during the holidays when I hit a low moment and with the help of my mother decided to seek help for my eating disorder.\" She, like many people who suffer with a mental health condition, relied on a routine to keep her functioning. But, routines go out the window around Christmas and Hanukkah with days off work, family gatherings, and special events. According to Kesha, it was this change of routine that affected her the most:\n\nWhen you have a routine, it\u2019s easier to manage whatever mental struggles you may be faced with, and when that routine is broken, it can trigger things you may not be ready to face. I know it has for me.\n\nThis phenomenon can also extend to those who might otherwise be stable in their mental health. Studies show that there's a sharp rise in depression and anxiety around the holidays. One of the reasons many people feel an increased feeling of despair around the holidays is the focus on family and togetherness. As Kesha mentions in her essay, she will be missing a \"beloved member of my family\" who recently died. If you are someone who has complicated interpersonal relationships, or if you recently lost a loved one, like Kesha, you might feel that sense of loss more acutely during December.\n\nTasos Katopodis/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nIn addition to her mantra, Kesha offers some more advice for dealing with that extra load of stress. Like many experts, she encourages her readers to go out for a walk in nature and to talk with a trusted friend or family member. \"Just do whatever helps you calm down and gives you a break from the stress,\" she advises. That includes maybe declining to go to a family gathering \"in favor of some personal time.\" Her personal favorite method of relieving her stress? Using meditation apps on her phone.\n\nUltimately, whether you're currently in treatment for a mental health condition, or if you just really find yourself relating to the lyrics of \"Blue Christmas,\" maybe it's time to give yourself the gift of self care. Kesha argues, \"It\u2019s not your responsibility to try to make the whole world happy.\" She adds, \"It\u2019s just another day \u2014 don\u2019t put unrealistic expectations on it, and don\u2019t beat yourself up.\" That's something we all should keep in mind.\n\nIf you or someone you know has an eating disorder and needs help, call the National Eating Disorders Association helpline at 1-800-931-2237, text 741741, or chat online with a Helpline volunteer here.", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/p/kesha-wrote-essay-for-anyone-dealing-with-depression-anxiety-this-holiday-season-6759626", "summary": "For many people struggling emotionally, with their personal lives, or with mental illness, the holiday season can be a source of major anxiety.\nBecause of this, Kesha wrote an essay about the holidays for TIME in which she encourages others with mental health issues to take care of themselves this holiday season.\nShe, like many people who suffer with a mental health condition, relied on a routine to keep her functioning.\nThis phenomenon can also extend to those who might otherwise be stable in their mental health.\nAs Kesha mentions in her essay, she will be missing a \"beloved member of my family\" who recently died.", "timescraped": 1513838496.154926, "category": {"words": 657, "personal": 4, "thirdperson": 23, "condition": 10, "recovery": 0}}, "46b49d2084de4f486c1173a0d084d33e": {"title": "7 Signs You Might Have Depersonalization Disorder", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost%2F2016%2F9%2F14%2Fa03af7cf-08d1-45bf-9530-ec5ca680cc77.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "text": "Although dissociative disorders affect two percent of the population, it's a category that tends to fly under the radar in pop psychology.

The National Alliance on Mental Illness estimates that nearly half of all adults in the United States experience depersonalization at least once in their lives, but as always, an isolated episode is an entirely different matter from a psychiatric disorder, which impairs your everyday functioning.\n\nSo what is dissociation? According to the International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation (ISSTD), dissociation describes the \"disconnection or lack of connection between things usually associated with each other.\" In psychology, this refers to a disconnect between an experience and your sense of self \u2014 for instance, thinking back on a traumatic event and feeling no emotional reaction, or feeling as if the world around you isn't real. Depersonalization is a form of dissociation referring to feeling distanced from your body; in essence, it refers to an out-of-body experience. You don't have to be a paranormal fanatic to know that these are actually fairly common, and they don't necessarily indicate a larger psychiatric problem.\n\nHowever, consistent episodes of depersonalization can develop into a disorder. Remember, the Internet is not where you should be getting your mental health diagnoses \u2014 but if you regularly experience any of the following symptoms, and they interfere with your everyday functioning, you may want to get checked out by a professional psychologist.\n\n1. You Feel Totally Detached From Your Body\n\nAt its core, depersonalization is a feeling of detachment, from both your body and your sense of self. A feeling of disconnection between your body and your consciousness is pretty much number one on the list of symptoms of depersonalization disorder.\n\n\n\n2. Your Reflection Feels Like A Stranger\n\nAccording to the ISSTD, this sense of detachment can become so profound that people with the disorder feel alienated from their own reflection. It's not that they can't recognize themselves \u2014 that's prosopagnosia, usually a symptom of brain damage. Rather, people with depersonalization disorder simply don't feel a connection to who they see in the mirror.\n\n3. You Experience Derealization\n\nDepersonalization is often accompanied by derealization, which refers to a sense of detachment from your surroundings. If you're experiencing derealization, you might feel like you're watching the world through a veil or on a movie screen.\n\n\n\n4. Life Feels Like A Dream\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, depersonalization is often accompanied by the feeling that you're living in a dream \u2014 and before you start making any Inception jokes, remember that movies are way less awesome in real life than they seem on the silver screen.\n\n5. You Watch Yourself Go Through The Motions\n\nAlthough out-of-body experiences don't necessarily mean you're literally watching yourself from afar, depersonalization is often characterized by a sense of watching yourself go through the motions of life. In fact, some people report feeling like a robot.\n\n6. You're Able to Recognize Reality\n\nIt's important to note that depersonalization disorder isn't a delusion; people with the disorder recognize that there's something wrong.\n\n7. Your Symptoms Aren't Caused By Anything Else\n\nAs mentioned before, there's a wide gulf between experiencing depersonalization and having depersonalization disorder. Dissociation is a fairly common experience, especially in the wake of trauma; in fact, it's an entire subtype of PTSD on its own. Furthermore, depersonalization can be caused by anything from substance abuse to brain damage \u2014 but in those cases, it's a sign of a different disorder rather than depersonalization disorder, which is rather rare.\n\n\n\nImages: Pexels, Giphy (7)\n\n", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/148334-7-signs-you-might-have-depersonalization-disorder", "summary": "As a result, it's easy to miss the signs of depersonalization disorder.\nRather, people with depersonalization disorder simply don't feel a connection to who they see in the mirror.\nYou're Able to Recognize RealityIt's important to note that depersonalization disorder isn't a delusion; people with the disorder recognize that there's something wrong.\nYour Symptoms Aren't Caused By Anything ElseAs mentioned before, there's a wide gulf between experiencing depersonalization and having depersonalization disorder.\nFurthermore, depersonalization can be caused by anything from substance abuse to brain damage \u2014 but in those cases, it's a sign of a different disorder rather than depersonalization disorder, which is rather rare.", "timescraped": 1513838497.397891, "category": {"words": 644, "personal": 0, "thirdperson": 7, "condition": 2, "recovery": 0}}, "f59a37247180e3a42244546742162be6": {"title": "What Is High Functioning Anxiety? 9 Things People With The Disorder Want You To Know", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/uploads/image/2017/10/13/3e8e5e1e-e7f1-4850-970a-f0c3514bae51-eutah-mizushima-26887.jpg?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "text": "When I tell people about my general anxiety disorder, they're often surprised. Based on the question I always get \u2014 \"What triggered it in the first place?\" \u2014 it's clear I don't fit the stereotype of an anxious person. I embrace public speaking opportunities, love going to parties, and can count on two hands the number of work days I've missed because of my mental health. I graduated college with highest honors and was the president of my university's journalism society. But an anxiety disorder isn't a personality trait \u2014 it's a medical condition. I've had crippling panic attacks since I was a young girl, and I've had two short-term hospital stays for suicidal ideation.\n\nHigh-functioning anxiety isn't an official diagnosis, but it's become a term used to describe people who have anxiety and live successful, busy lives. People with high-functioning anxiety want you to know what we're dealing with, but it's often difficult to find the words. If anything, you might look at someone with high-functioning anxiety and envy their discipline, since we're often perfectionists and love to stay active. We may stay silent about our anxiety for fear of seeming dramatic, and you might be shocked to find out we've been suffering. After all, we seem just fine. I can't act as a spokesperson for every person with high-functioning anxiety, but there are some things you should know if you have someone in your life with an anxiety disorder, especially if they have high-functioning anxiety.\n\nIt May Seem Like We Have It All Together Cathryn Lavery/Unsplash Due to stigma, people with mental illness are incorrectly thought of as violent, scary, or hard to work with. High-functioning anxiety presents a contrast to the stereotype: We often seem to have our lives together in impressive ways, and we're detail-oriented and can meet deadlines. That doesn't mean we aren't suffering.\n\nMaking Mistakes Devastates Us Angelina Litvin/Unsplash Everyone looks back at errors and cringes, but if you have high-functioning anxiety, making a mistake feels crushing. Interestingly, some psychologists suggest those with high-functioning anxiety are better employees because of their fear. If you know someone with high-functioning anxiety, try to cut them some slack when they mess up. They're already overanalyzing themselves.\n\nWe Overanalyze Everything Ben White/Unsplash You know how you rehash a conversation with a crush to see if you missed any hidden signals? Imagine doing that, but with every interaction you have. From work meetings to casual talks with friends, we're replaying every single moment and chiding ourselves for any perceived errors.\n\nOur Busyness Is Often A Coping Mechanism mauro mora/Unsplash Anxiety often brings paralyzing fear, so it's not exactly surprising that you may think that busy people aren't prone to anxiety. If you know someone with high-functioning anxiety, they're likely staying busy to avoid their thoughts.\n\nIt's Hard For Us To Reach Out Marc-Olivier Jodoin/Unsplash Asking for mental health help is difficult, but it's even worse when you have high-functioning anxiety. You live a decent life and can function, so why do you need professional treatment? Of course, treatment makes dealing with anxiety much easier, but it's hard to come to terms with needing help.\n\nOur Anxiety May Not Make Sense To You Sam Manns/Unsplash Anyone with high-functioning anxiety will tell you they often face disbelief when they share their struggles with people. When you have a life that seems perfect, people don't understand why you'd ever have mental turmoil. Remember that anxiety is caused by biological factors and life experiences, so having good relationships, wealth or beauty doesn't mean someone won't deal with the condition.\n\nYou Should Ask Us How We're Doing Priscilla Du Preez/Unsplash Even responding to someone saying, \"How are you?\" is a complicated task for someone with high-functioning anxiety. Still, you should ask. Remind them that you care, and know that it's an honor if they open up to you.\n\nWe Internalize Your Advice Tim Gouw/Unsplash If we do reach out for advice, we're going to cling to what you say. I still remember when my then-boyfriend told me to just \"be happy\" after I confided in him about my anxiety. (He ended up learning a lot later, and I ended up marrying him, but I'll never forget that awful advice.) Just listen.

If only it were that easy. Here's the thing \u2014 depression is not a choice, and telling people to snap out of it is like telling someone with a broken bone to quit their whining already.\n\nAccording to Harvard Medical School, depression happens in the brain, and thus is not something people can control. \"Certain areas of the brain help regulate mood. Researchers believe that \u2014 more important than levels of specific brain chemicals \u2014 nerve cell connections, nerve cell growth, and the functioning of nerve circuits have a major impact on depression.\" Armed with this information, researchers are now exploring possible links between poor production of new neurons in the hippocampus (the part of the brain responsible for emotion, memory, and controlling the nervous system) and depression.\n\nAnd, research shows that unchecked poor neuron production can lead to Major Depressive Episodes (MDD), which actually changes the brain. Symptoms of MDD range from persistent feelings of emptiness and hopelessness, to changes in weight, insomnia, and other physical symptoms that appear without explanation. A study by NIGMA MDD Working Group at USC found that MDD causes physiological damage to the brain, and results in a smaller hippocampus.\n\nJust how common is depression? Psychology Today reports that depression affects more than 300 million people globally, but less than 50 percent ever get treatment. Can you imagine if 50 percent of people with broken legs didn't get treated?\n\nHere are just a few more reasons why depression is never a choice, and why it isn't possible to just \"snap out of it.\"\n\nDepression Is An Illness, Not A Lifestyle Choice\n\nWhile depression is a medical condition, like a broken bone, finding treatment for it can be much harder than finding treatment for physical conditions. Finding someone I like and trust who provides both medication management and talk therapy, and who also takes insurance, is like finding a unicorn. If I could find either one, I'd be over the moon.\n\nPsychology Today reported that extended schooling and a lower earning potential are responsible for many med students not choosing psychiatry as their speciality, which has resulted in a shortage of mental health doctors. Additionally, dealing with insurance companies adds another layer of frustration to the process for people trying to get help for their depression.\n\nFor example, most HMO health insurance plans require authorization from your primary care doctor to seek mental health treatment through your insurance. Additionally, the Atlantic reported that, according to the American Psychological Association, 30 percent of psychologists don't take insurance at all.\n\nAnd, according to Mental Health America, one out of five adults actively seeking treatment for a mental illness reported that they are not able to get the treatment they need, in part because, on average, there is only one mental health provider for every 529 people seeking treatment.\n\n\"Once a person recognizes that they may have a mental health problem, finding support especially the right kind of support is often difficult,\" Mental Health America noted. Barriers to accessing care include: Lack of insurance or inadequate insurance, lack of available treatment providers, lack of available treatment types (inpatient treatment, individual therapy, intensive community services), and insufficient finances to cover costs \u2014 including, co-pays, uncovered treatment types, or providers who do not take insurance.\n\nWhat's more is that people who need help for their depression often don't get it because depression can be a largely invisible disease, and many who witness depression lose patience for friends, family, co-workers, and loved ones battling their illness because they think the person should be able to change their behavior if they just tried harder. This problem in particular has motivated Lady Gaga and her mom, Cynthia Germanotta, to offer Mental Health First-Aid classes \u2014 sponsored by Born This Way Foundation and the National Council for Behavioral Health \u2014 to help people better recognize symptoms of mental illness in others, according to Mashable.\n\nNo, We Can't Snap Out Of It\n\nThe good news is that depression is treatable. The bad news is that finding treatment that is effective, affordable, and accessible is extremely difficult. You have to become your own advocate, and do your own research. You have to ask a lot of questions, especially about medication, particularly if you're drug intolerant like me. It sometimes feels like a full-time job, and managing this can be difficult for someone who is depressed.\n\nI once had a doctor who switched my meds; he told me to simply stop taking the old one and start taking the new one. I know now that this is really dangerous because you need to be weaned off of prescription medication, but back then, I didn't know that what my doctor was advising me might be incorrect. Within a few days I was crying uncontrollably, taking dangerous risks while driving, and I couldn't stop shaking. I thought I was losing my mind, but in reality, I was intolerant to the new medication while simultaneously experiencing sudden withdrawal from the old one.\n\nLuckily, I also had a therapist who was also a registered nurse, and she recognized what was happening right away. She advised me to refill my old prescription, and to promptly switch doctors. She basically saved my life. Now, I ask a ton of questions about any suggested medication. It might come off as annoying, but I do what I have to do to advocate for my own mental health.\n\nBelieve me, if I could snap my fingers and not have to deal with any of this, I'd be snapping my ass off. Unfortunately, it doesn't work like that.\n\nIf We Could, We Would\n\nFor me, depression feels like disappearing, watching it happen, but not being able to do anything about it. It feels like shouting for help, but no one can hear you. It feels like being blindfolded inside a labyrinth and told to find your way out. It feels like being underwater all of the time. Plenty of other writers and artists have had similar thoughts about their depression, which has helped move the mental health conversation out of the shadows.\n\n\u201cDepression is the most unpleasant thing I have ever experienced,\" J.K. Rowling once told The Times. \"Sad hurts but it\u2019s a healthy feeling. It is a necessary thing to feel. Depression is very different.\u201d Carrie Fisher once asked, \"Is it worth the trouble it takes trying to live so that someday you get something worthwhile out of it, instead of it almost always taking worthwhile things out of you?\" And, Lady Gaga described her depression to Rolling Stone as \"Deep sadness, like an anchor dragging\" everywhere she went.\n\nSo, I'm not alone when I say that I would love to be able to just snap out of it. Unfortunately, it's just not a possibility. But with therapy, medication, and increased awareness about what depression actually is, we might be able to work our way out of it, one step at a time.", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/p/stop-telling-people-to-snap-out-of-it-depression-is-not-a-choice-70496", "summary": "Here's the thing \u2014 depression is not a choice, and telling people to snap out of it is like telling someone with a broken bone to quit their whining already.\nDepression Is An Illness, Not A Lifestyle ChoiceWhile depression is a medical condition, like a broken bone, finding treatment for it can be much harder than finding treatment for physical conditions.\nFor example, most HMO health insurance plans require authorization from your primary care doctor to seek mental health treatment through your insurance.\n\"Once a person recognizes that they may have a mental health problem, finding support especially the right kind of support is often difficult,\" Mental Health America noted.\nIt might come off as annoying, but I do what I have to do to advocate for my own mental health.", "timescraped": 1513838499.9213738, "category": {"words": 1186, "personal": 32, "thirdperson": 20, "condition": 25, "recovery": 1}}, "d66a1c16389013abfc58896bfea45607": {"title": "I'm Sick Of People Being Shocked That I Have Anxiety Because I'm \"Outgoing\"", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/2016/12/21/5cf39314-4e7e-4bb4-ac8d-74d4712c1d47.jpg?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "text": "I often think about the girl in my ninth grade class who had to take time off of school to be treated for clinical depression. At that point in my life, I had heard a thing or two about mental illness, but it was usually from the seniors at school who cracked jokes about it. I don't remember learning anything about it in health class, and I certainly don't recall my parents explaining the impact depression could have on a person's life. By the time the whole school caught wind of this girl having to be excused from school indefinitely, everyone started talking about it, as adolescents do.\n\n\"Well, it's no surprise she's, like, depressed,\" I overheard a junior tennis player say in the hallway. \"She had no social skills.\"\n\n\"Yeah, she was weirdly quiet,\" her friend chimed in.\n\nThere was no judgment in their voice. They weren't exactly gossiping. Rather, it sounded like they were simply stating the truth, like a science teacher would share characteristics of elements on the periodic table. To them, it was a fact: Mentally ill people aren't any good in social settings.\n\nFast forward several years later, and I was being diagnosed with a mental illness of my own. After years of chewing off my fingernails, obsessively picking at the skin on my toes, and constantly walking around on the verge of a panic attack, a medical professional at the college clinic told me I was suffering from an anxiety disorder. An \"unspecified anxiety disorder,\" to be exact, whatever that meant.\n\nI was in disbelief at first, and insisted that he had gotten it all wrong. I told him I had friends. I went to parties and smiled in group pictures. I had a (sort-of) boyfriend. People liked me. If my slighter-better-than-average social life wasn't proof enough that I wasn't mentally ill, I didn't know what was. He gently assured me that wasn't how anxiety disorders work, but without much more explanation, he patted me on the back and wished me luck. I never saw him again.\n\nI would later learn I'm far from alone: The U.S. Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) reports that anxiety is the most common mental health disorder in America. Forty million individuals over the age of 18 suffer from an anxiety disorder, or 18 percent of the population. Women are twice as likely to live with anxiety than men are. On average, a person spends 55 minutes a day worrying, while a person with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) spends 300 minutes of their day stuck in unsettling thought. The CDC says that only 25 percent of people with anxiety feel like their illness is understood or cared about by their loved ones.\n\nIt wasn't long after my diagnosis that I came to face to face with this reality myself. In the years that followed my diagnosis, I learned more about this mental illness and sought treatment from trusted clinicians. I realized that a lot of my traits that seemed to be in conflict with my anxiety disorder \u2014 outgoing, immersed in multiple tasks, hospitable \u2014 were actually symptoms of it.\n\nOne therapist suggested that I had been living with high-functioning anxiety, a form of anxiety that is imperceptible to the outside eye, since the person always appears busy and engaged in meaningful conversation. But there is turmoil brewing inside a person with high-functioning anxiety. They feel terribly nervous in the midst of every social interaction, and they're constantly doubting whether they're good enough. They appear calm on the exterior, though \u2014 an effective defense mechanism to ward off unwanted attention.\n\nNo matter what our role is, society expects us to play that role perfectly, or else we aren't taken seriously. If survivors of sexual assault don't say or wear the right thing, or react in an acceptable way by society's standards, they're deemed unreliable. If a mother doesn't wear modest enough clothes or radiates too much sexuality, she's considered a bad parent. Similarly, if a person with a mental illness doesn't live out their correlating symptoms in public, people automatically assume they aren't sick. Or worse, they're thought to be lying about the state of their mental health for attention.\n\nThe Mighty on YouTube\n\nSeveral months after the diagnosis, when I told the first few people about my anxiety disorder, they looked at me like I had lost my mind. They insisted that the doctor was either a fraud or that I had just gone to see them on a particularly bad day.\n\n\"Yeah, OK. Then I was depressed last weekend when I stayed in and charged through three tubs of ice cream,\" one of my friends responded to the news.\n\n\"But...you're friendly,\" another person said. \"Like, you're really good in social settings.\"\n\nI knew it was true, but I also knew that the symptoms I had been living with for the last few years were just as true, even if they were hidden. Yes, I was social, but I was also a slave to nervous sweats and chewing off skin that should never be chewed off under any circumstances. I could hardly ever get a full night of sleep, and every one of those life-of-the-party moments my friends recall were nothing more than an attempt to distract myself from the debilitating inner dialogue I didn't want to confront.\n\nIt seemed like nobody was willing to hear me out. They knew was what they saw in group settings \u2014 I didn't have a disorder. It was infuriating and frustrating. It made me feel like a fraud.\n\nThese days, if I ever feel comfortable enough to talk about my anxiety with someone, their reaction is pretty much the same. They express genuine disbelief. They sometimes roll their eyes and offhandedly mention how everyone has got some kind of anxiety in today's busy world.\n\nI know they don't mean to diminish the daily battle I endure, but reactions like these can have a weighty effect on people who are living with a mental illness. We're already tired from the symptoms we manage, the treatment we seek, and the medication we potentially have to take. The inner landscape is turbulent enough. When you add on the judgment that comes from misinformed (and sometimes ignorant) people, recovery is a daunting process.\n\nI still think about that girl from my ninth grade class from time to time. I often hope she received the treatment she needed. I wonder what the response would have been, though, if she had acted any differently in social settings. Would her illness have been disregarded by her peers? Would she have even been offered treatment so readily?\n\nThere is no \"right\" way to act when you have a mental illness, and that's something that we should all learn from a young age. Just like anything else in life \u2014 love, sexuality, likes and dislikes \u2014 mental illness can sometimes be a fluid concept that doesn't fit neatly into a rigid box. We do what we can do with what we've got, and we cross our fingers that the people around us give us the space to work through it.\n\nAs for me, I'm trying to stay confident in who I am and practice self-acceptance of my own illness. And I remind myself that while not everyone will understand the varying nuances of my anxiety, the people who truly matter in my life will try their very best to wrap their heads around it.\n\nImages: Gina Florio", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/p/im-sick-of-people-being-shocked-that-i-have-anxiety-because-im-outgoing-25487", "summary": "Fast forward several years later, and I was being diagnosed with a mental illness of my own.\nAn \"unspecified anxiety disorder,\" to be exact, whatever that meant.\nIf my slighter-better-than-average social life wasn't proof enough that I wasn't mentally ill, I didn't know what was.\nForty million individuals over the age of 18 suffer from an anxiety disorder, or 18 percent of the population.\nI realized that a lot of my traits that seemed to be in conflict with my anxiety disorder \u2014 outgoing, immersed in multiple tasks, hospitable \u2014 were actually symptoms of it.", "timescraped": 1513838501.166259, "category": {"words": 1263, "personal": 60, "thirdperson": 41, "condition": 24, "recovery": 3}}, "f5ee7f1304fd420f2da72c2720b6ca54": {"title": "Women With Serious Mental Health Issues Share How They Manage Day-To-Day Life", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/uploads/image/2017/8/1/88a529b7-3cbe-4c14-9205-c8f877595139-health.jpg?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "text": "Mental health disorders are so heavily stigmatized in our culture, but that doesn't change how they can feel: debilitating, all-consuming, soul-crushing. For women with serious mental health issues, navigating daily life is a whole different conversation. Getting out of bed can be a challenge. Having a casual discussion with a coworker feels like too much. Trying to get through dinner can be overwhelming. Simple day-to-day tasks that others might take for granted can seem insurmountable to a woman battling mental illness \u2014 so how do they cope?\n\nThe topic was recently discussed on Reddit, where women truthfully and candidly shared their own demons, and how they fight daily to not let them win. So much more effort goes into this than I think many of us realize. It's not even really a day-to-day fight \u2014 it's hour-to-hour. One minute, you might be fine. The next, you might crumble into a million pieces with no warning. It's exhausting and discouraging, but they march on.\n\nEveryone has their own personal approach. Some women have found a way to get through the day relatively unscathed; others are still in the midst of it, trying to find their way through. One thing is for certain, though: they're all stronger than they might realize.\n\n1 One Day \u2014 Or Hour \u2014 At A Time Kudos to this gal for staying positive even in the darkest times. This is a big accomplishment for any person, regardless of whether or not they're suffering from a mental illness. Keeping it positive during your lowest lows can make or break the situation \u2014 you just try your best to find something to be happy about.\n\n2 One Problem At A Time Sometimes, breaking things down into even smaller pieces is the answer, and makes life seem more manageable. When you've got a dozen different things making life harder, try focusing on one at a time.\n\n3 Talking It Out It's so tempting (and easy) to keep it all bottled up; and why not? When it feels like no one understands you and you're alone in the world, it doesn't seem that sharing your feelings could do any good. But letting it all out and having someone to at least listen means that you aren't alone. Even if they don't understand, they can still provide emotional support.\n\n4 Going Unnoticed When you're struggling mentally, sometimes the situation only worsens when people constantly ask about how you are and what's bothering you and if you're sad today. While it might not be the solution, sometimes all we can do to cope is try to be invisible.\n\n5 Running On Autopilot Sometimes, when you know you have to keep moving and life goes on but you just can't deal, you turn your mind off completely. This is how many depressed people get through the day. The world doesn't stop spinning \u2014 bills need to be paid, children need to be cared for, you have responsibilities. It helps you keep functioning, but it's still no way to live.\n\n6 Avoiding Triggers And Staying Healthy People struggling with mental health issues are usually aware of at least some of the things that could trigger a particularly bad episode. It could be certain foods or a lack of sleep; it might be certain people or a painful memory. Either way, you avoid them like the plague to try to maintain your wellbeing.\n\n7 The Dark Times Aren't Permanent Avoiding problems as if they don't exist doesn't typically do us much good; rather, people with mental illnesses often fare better when they face reality head on. But, perspective is key: this bad moment will pass, and there are brighter days ahead. You just have to hang on.\n\n8 Being A Homebody We have to work. We have to pay bills. But what do you do when work sucks the life out of you and you leave feeling like your tank is empty? You go home, sit quietly, and recharge your battery. People can be exhausting, even under the best circumstances.

And being kind to people, especially when you don't understand their experience... that's even cooler. Among the endless decidedly uncool insults it was once totally permissible to sling at people, perhaps \"crazy\" is the one we haven't fully addressed as a collective, awakened humanity. I think this is because that word very gently toes the line between just an adjective or adverb for something \"out of the norm\" and a really offensive undertone, and because we aren't well acquainted with why it would be offensive, we let it slide.\n\nLet's first talk about who usually gets called crazy. Girls \u2014 OK, I think we covered them all! But seriously: it's been a really common insult used to define a woman whose emotional experience is out of the realm that someone feels comfortable acknowledging, or worse, it's used when someone who is going through an intense emotional experience, or actual mental illness, is behaving in a way that's not \"normal.\" It's dismissive, short sighted, ignorant and stigmatizing, but while the freedom of speech (thankfully) prevails, I cannot actually argue that we should never use this word ever, ever again, but here's a pretty solid case for maybe reconsidering the next time you want to insult someone with it anyway:\n\nNormal Is Subjective\n\nAnd \"crazy\" = not \"normal,\" in a \"bad\" way. The reality is that normal is subjective, and abnormal is, too; worse: the fact that we insult people by calling them \"different\" is really telling of how collectively brainwashed we are to believe \"right\" is a one-seal-deal. (Think about it for a second: historically, the people who were the most aware and awakened and right-minded if you define right-minded by being objectively kind and loving were called \"crazy.\") We just like to police one another into an idea of normalcy that makes our own uncertain existence a little more palatable, and it's not cool, in any way. It's like the subconscious, grown up version of bullying a kid to make yourself feel better. (OK, it's not \"like,\" that, it is that.)\n\n\n\nJust Because You Don't Personally Understand Someone's Experience, That Doesn't Make It Invalid\n\nSimilar to normal and crazy being subjective, the subjective experience that you have in your life is not the only one that is a valid and correct; just because the limited scope of people you've been exposed to in your life have collectively not behaved in a way that aligns with this \"crazy\" behavior that's so hard for you to stomach doesn't mean it's wrong, and it certainly doesn't mean you have a right to police it in a way that makes sense to you. Just because you don't share someone's emotional experience doesn't make it \"other,\" and yours \"right,\" and that's basically what you're arguing when you call someone behaving differently \"crazy.\"\n\n\n\nCalling A Girl \"Crazy\" Is Usually Just A Means To Dismiss How She Is Feeling\n\nIt's usually what happens when people aren't comfortable with women being anything but \"small.\" Small in body, mind, emotion, you name it. Ideal women in our society are small and secondary, even if we think we've eradicated a lot of stigmatizing legally and socially, there are still these undertones that kind of show us how far we have to go. When women are emotionally expressive, it's threatening. And it's threatening because they're stepping beyond the very slim (ehem) line of what's acceptable and tolerable. When you call a girl who is not mentally ill insane because she's having some kind of emotional experience, it alludes to the fact that we're more comfortable when women don't do that, as it preserves their place in society: secondary.\n\n\n\nUsing That Word To Describe Erratic, Frightening Behavior Stigmatizes Mental Illness Even More\n\nStigmatizing mental illness is a big enough issue as it is. When an illness threatens, or does, affect our cognitive functioning, our awareness, or our personalities, we find that scary. So scary, in fact, that we've all but made it so bad to be mentally ill that people would rather deny and avoid their issues than seek help from them. But talking about them in an open and honest way helps. It's fine, and almost normal at this point, for people to struggle with anxiety and depression, and that's because we've normalized it through conversation. All of this to say: the last thing that people who are genuinely struggling with mental illness need is to feel even more isolated or \"different\" than they already do.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s A Way To Shrug Off Whatever Empathy You Should Have Or Responsibility You Could Be Taking By Blaming The Person For What They're Going Through\n\nI'm not going to call it victim blaming, though I'd argue that some people would probably find that appropriate. It's not true of every situation, but it's accurate often enough: when someone dismisses someone else's emotional experience, it's often because they want to avoid taking any part of the blame. Of course, this isn't to say that everybody else is responsible for an individual's feelings (I actually believe the exact opposite is true), but it is to say that if your behavior is the cause of someone's pain, and rather than address that, you dismiss them by calling them \"crazy\" (and therefore make yourself the victim of that person's \"crazy\" behavior) you're using feigned composure to manipulate, gaslight and alter how people see the situation, and all the while convincing yourself that it's reality.\n\n\n\nIt's A Way To Avoid Facing Your Own Emotional Experience\n\nWhat a desire or pattern of dismissing other people's emotions comes down to is this: you do not want to address your own emotional experience, you don't want to bear down within yourself and listen, or understand, or help, or even just acknowledge it, because that means you must also listen, understand and acknowledge your own emotional experience. This is to say: people who dismiss other people's emotions are deeply in the abyss of not being able to address their own.\n\n\n\nImages: Netflix; Giphy(3)", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/101990-6-reasons-crazy-is-never-a-thing-you-should-call-someone-regardless-of-their", "summary": "And being kind to people, especially when you don't understand their experience... that's even cooler.\nLet's first talk about who usually gets called crazy.\nJust because you don't share someone's emotional experience doesn't make it \"other,\" and yours \"right,\" and that's basically what you're arguing when you call someone behaving differently \"crazy.\"\nUsing That Word To Describe Erratic, Frightening Behavior Stigmatizes Mental Illness Even MoreStigmatizing mental illness is a big enough issue as it is.\nIt's not true of every situation, but it's accurate often enough: when someone dismisses someone else's emotional experience, it's often because they want to avoid taking any part of the blame.", "timescraped": 1513838503.6569102, "category": {"words": 1055, "personal": 25, "thirdperson": 15, "condition": 5, "recovery": 0}}, "837a38ed085f34dfc65f94ea331302a5": {"title": "If Physical Illnesses Were Treated Like Mental Health Problems, It Would Look Like This (Spoiler: Completely Ridiculous) \u2014 VIDEO", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost%2F2016%2F9%2F13%2Fa630d180-5606-4d0a-97f2-ab7466127bd4.png?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "text": "It's no secret that mental health isn't taken quite as seriously as physical illness.

The video poses the question: Isn't it time we started taking mental illness more seriously?\n\nShowing people in different states of disrepair, from the flu, to broken bones, to even diabetes, the video highlights the skepticism of people to mental illness by acting casually to these physical illnesses, which we know no one would ever do in reality.

One side effect of this eagerness is often an interest in regulatory and legislative solutions to complex issues of mental health. It's a nice thought \u2014 but often, these proposals are developed without any input from the mentally ill community, which often results in proposals that sound nice on paper, but in practice are harmful to the very people they supposedly set out to help. And they sometimes come with hidden kickers that may surprise the public, too.\n\nFor every genuinely positive policy like Affordable Care Act, which has clauses mandating mental health parity and equal access to treatment, there are a dozen that demonize mental illness and propose ideas that are counterproductive and sometimes even dangerous for mentally ill people.\n\nI've rounded up some of the most pervasive problematic policy proposals \u2014 and alternatives that could offer real help for mentally ill people.\n\n1. Mandatory Medication Laws\n\nStephen Chernin/Getty Images News/Getty Images\n\nThe Policy: Mandatory medication laws like Laura's Law in California and Kendra's Law in New York \u2014 usually named after tragic cases in which people with severe untreated mental illness committed crimes \u2014 allow a state or county to require people who meet specific criteria to receive medication and other outpatient treatment. These laws are often backed by family members and legislators as a solution to mental health issues. But they're dangerously disempowering for mentally ill people, and they don't actually solve the bigger mental health crisis.\n\nCompelling people to get treatment by force of law doesn't necessarily mean that treatment will go well \u2014 and once someone meets the requirements set by the state, that person may return to an untreated state. Managing mental health conditions is complex and requires collaboration \u2014 something difficult to obtain when a patient feels cornered and trapped.\n\nProviding crisis mental health services is also extremely expensive. If a state isn't providing a variety of early intervention and treatment programs, but is paying for a costly forced treatment law, it's effectively saying that they prefer to wait until people are in crisis before offering help. That's not efficient, and may promote harm \u2014 it's important to note that research shows chronic untreated depression can actually cause brain damage. The sooner someone is provided with effective, compassionate treatment, the better. Waiting until disaster strikes is inhumane.\n\nInstead, Consider: Empowering mentally ill people to make their own decisions about the most appropriate treatment for their needs, including but not limited to medication (outside of emergent mental health crisis). Patients who play an active role in their care plan are more likely to adhere to it, according to a 2005 study in Therapeutics and Risk Management.\n\n2. Suspensions of Privacy Rights for Mentally Ill People\n\nJoe Raedle/Getty Images News/Getty Images\n\nThe Policy: Mental health settings are one of the few contexts in which a patient's personal information can be disclosed without notification or consent (in the case of situations where someone is deemed a harm to themselves or others). Some proposals aim to expand these exceptions more broadly, to allow wide-ranging nonconsensual access to a patient's medical records.\n\nMany of these proposals are framed from the perspective that family members should have access to a patient's records in order to \"help\" them \u2014 but this can create an atmosphere of distrust and prevent the patient from receiving effective treatment. For example, a patient who doesn't know who might end up accessing privileged information may be more reticent to be frank with care providers.\n\nMentally ill people are autonomous human beings and they have a right to, and reasonable expectation of, privacy. Violating that privacy creates an inherent disadvantage and a dangerous power dynamic that may make people feel disempowered and hopeless \u2014 especially when access to medical records could be used for coercion, manipulation, or abuse.\n\nInstead, consider: Making mentally ill family members and friends feel comfortable with approaching you when they need help, as well as working with them to develop their advance care directives and voluntarily determine who should have access to which information, and when. A trusting relationship is far more likely to lead to a productive outcome.\n\n3. Gun Laws Targeting the Mentally Ill Population\n\nScott Olson/Getty Images News/Getty Images\n\nThe Policy: Sometimes, disablist social policy makes for strange bedfellows, like the NRA and the disability community. It may seem controversial to target gun reform for criticism, but this isn't about the Second Amendment \u2014 it's actually about privacy and autonomy.\n\nThere are two problems with gun laws targeting mentally ill people, and the first is this: They bolster the notion that mentally ill people are dangerous.\n\nIn reality, scores of studies clearly indicate that mentally ill people are less likely to be violent than sane people, and that they are more likely to be victims of violence. Yes, some mentally ill people with guns kill people, and that is a tragedy. Many sane people do it, too, however, and it's also a tragedy then. And guns laws targeting the mentally ill ignore the reality that violent behavior is far more often linked to other factors than it is mental illness. Targeting public health problems like this one requires understanding which actions will do the most good \u2014 and if you take guns out of the hands of every mentally ill person in America today, the epidemic of gun violence in this country will continue.\n\nThe second issue surrounds patient privacy and autonomy: How do you decide who is \"too mentally ill\" to own a gun? And how do you enforce such a ban? Any ban would require people to be listed on databases used in background checks, which means outing mentally ill people to anyone who can access those databases \u2014 and that's dangerous.\n\nThis issue came to the fore earlier this year when Congress voted to disapprove an Obama administration regulation that required the Social Security Administration to submit information about people who use representative payees to databases used in background checks. This vote was viewed by many as a vote against \"keeping guns out of the hands of mentally ill people\" and Congressional Republicans were roundly criticized for it.\n\nHowever, the vast majority of mentally ill people in America \u2014 including people with severe mental illness \u2014 don't use representative payees. Representative payees act as legal financial proxies in the lives of people deemed \"incompetent\" to manage their financial affairs, who usually have developmental, cognitive, or intellectual disabilities.\n\nThe payee system itself is controversial in the disability community, but using it as grounds for discrimination is very troubling. Especially since the regulation would have required the Department of Health and Services to revise HIPAA \u2014 the privacy regulation protecting all patients in America \u2014 in order to accommodate the release of personal medical information.\n\nAnd it's unclear how many, if any, gun crimes are actually committed by people who used representative payees at the time of the incident \u2014 no current research has indicated that this group is at greater risk of committing gun crimes than any other.\n\nInstead, consider: Ending the ban on funding gun research to learn more about the origins and nature of gun violence. And comprehensive gun reform that limits the total number of guns in circulation, period, and bars assault weapons across the board. Such reform could include restrictions on ownership of certain weapons, mandatory comprehensive background checks, controls on ammunition sales, and required safety training and testing for gun owners.\n\n4. Increasing Beds for Mental Health Treatment\n\nTheo Heimann/Getty Images News/Getty Images\n\nThe Policy: You may have heard people calling to \"increase the number of beds\" dedicated to mental health services in America, citing a critical bed shortage that makes it hard for people to access care. In mental health crisis, inpatient treatment saves lives \u2014 so adding more beds seems like a natural solution, right?\n\nOr maybe not. Rather than asking how we can get more beds, we should instead ask why so many people are ending up in crisis in the first place \u2014 and if there are ways we could reduce or eliminate the bed shortage. Even in a perfect world, some people will absolutely need inpatient care and it offers tremendous benefits \u2014 but there's probably a way we can bring demand down with early, effective treatment.\n\nIt's also important to consider the role of forced institutionalization in the history of psychiatry. Historically, many mentally ill people were abandoned in institutions with inadequate treatment, and this legacy lingers. Some mentally ill people are wary of inpatient treatment, fearing that it may lead to an extended forced stay when they would rather be receiving supportive outpatient care and living in their communities.\n\nDoes involuntary commitment sound like a scary nightmare to you? Believe me, it also sounds scary to mentally ill people.\n\nInstead, consider: Expanding access to early intervention and treatment. That means protecting and enforcing parity laws, ensuring that people can access mental health services when they need them, and reducing the stigma that makes people reluctant to seek treatment.\n\nSo why are so many policies proposed that are not grounded in research? One of the issues at work here (though certainly not the only one) is the popularity of making armchair diagnoses. The practice of assigning mental health diagnoses to people is a popular one in American society \u2014 and it's also a big problem. Diagnosing mental illnesses is a complex task requiring clinical experience and training, and even advanced clinicians get it wrong sometimes. A bad diagnosis can lead to years of struggling with the wrong treatments and failing to stabilize a mental illness.\n\nWhen society is doing the diagnosing, it's not offering treatment \u2014 it is serving up mental health stigma. People engaging in armchair diagnosis often demonize mentally ill people in the process, assigning negative, dangerous, and hateful behavior to a mental health problem. This suggests that people believe mental illness causes people to be violent, cruel, bigoted, or dangerous, and that simply isn't the case.", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/p/some-policies-that-claim-to-help-the-mentally-ill-are-actually-harmful-heres-why-58478", "summary": "I've rounded up some of the most pervasive problematic policy proposals \u2014 and alternatives that could offer real help for mentally ill people.\nBut they're dangerously disempowering for mentally ill people, and they don't actually solve the bigger mental health crisis.\nManaging mental health conditions is complex and requires collaboration \u2014 something difficult to obtain when a patient feels cornered and trapped.\nThere are two problems with gun laws targeting mentally ill people, and the first is this: They bolster the notion that mentally ill people are dangerous.\nPeople engaging in armchair diagnosis often demonize mentally ill people in the process, assigning negative, dangerous, and hateful behavior to a mental health problem.", "timescraped": 1513838485.997893, "category": {"words": 1698, "personal": 5, "thirdperson": 19, "condition": 26, "recovery": 0}}, "fda0521617f01fce25b44a8aa16f3277": {"title": "8 Books About Mental Health Every Teenager Should Read", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost%2F2016%2F9%2F13%2F2933f9c3-5f4b-449a-a2bc-37d771f55308.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "text": "Young adult novels have always been a great place for teens to read about the difficult issues they might be facing.

The Virgin Suicides by Jeffrey Eugenides\n\nThe five Lisbon sisters live very secluded lives, oppressed by their overbearing mother and their submissive workaholic father.

While a lot of them have to do with her dogs and her childhood, a significant part of the book is devoted to her struggles with depression. It's a heartbreaking look at it, made all the more realistic by the fact that the author lived through it herself. The added bonus is that not only will it make you feel less alone, it will make you laugh until milk comes out of your nose.\n\n5. The Magicians by Lev Grossman\n\nWhen I was lost in the throes of my own depression, I often obsessed about going somewhere new in the hopes that my perceived problems would go away with the new location.

She can be seen talking about everything from her own struggles with depression to fighting against bullying. Now Demi Lovato is taking on the stigma of bipolar disorder, which the singer has admitted she suffers from. Lovato is opening up and laying it all on the line in hopes that she can help others who suffer from mental illness. In partnership with The Mental Health Listening & Engagement Tour, Lovato has released a video showing her speaking up about having bipolar disorder.\n\nI'm Demi Lovato. I'm a recording artist, author, songwriter and actress. I'm also living with bipolar disorder. I've seen some dark times, especially with the depressive phase of the illness. Bipolar depression really got my life off track, but today I'm proud to say I'm living proof that someone can live, love and be well with bipolar disorder when they get the education, support and treatment they need ... I want to shine a light on the people out there who, like me, are learning to live well with mental illness by getting the right diagnosis and the right treatment plan.\n\n\n\nIt certainly can't be easy to share something like that on a national stage, but it's not the first time Lovato has shone a light on mental illness to raise awareness. Here are 5 other times she took a stand against the stigma.\n\nWHEN SHE OPENED UP ABOUT HER DAD'S STRUGGLE\n\n[Twitter Embed: https://twitter.com/ddlovato/statuses/349418667634728963]\n\nIf sharing your own story is hard, it must be even harder to share the details about your father. But Lovato did just that when she opened up about her estranged father's own battle with mental illness. \"At the end of the day, he's still my dad and I grew up with him and he was a wonderful person,\" she sad while on Good Morning America in 2013. \"I'm a firm believer that everything happens for a reason. I've dealt with mental illnesses, but my father also dealt with mental illness and he was not able to function very well in society.\"\n\n\n\nSharing her experience with her father's mental illness could be a wakeup call for any of her fans whose parents also struggle with similar illnesses. Knowing you're not alone when you're a child dealing with something like that can be very powerful.\n\n\n\nWHEN SHE LAUNCHED THE LOVATO TREATMENT SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM\n\nTo honor her father after his passing, Lovato started the scholarship program to pay for people with mental illness to get the treatment they need. It's not a foundation with donations, rather Demi Lovato herself is paying out of pocket to help these people. It doesn't get much more \"walking the talk\" than that.\n\n\n\nWHEN SHE TALKED ABOUT HER EATING DISORDER\n\n[Twitter Embed: https://twitter.com/ddlovato/statuses/150381654119153665]\n\nLovato has admitted she struggled with eating and her body image from the age of eight.\n\n\n\nI started overeating, compulsively overeating. I would bake cookies and then eat the whole pan. I went from doing that to being unhappy with my body. I went to just completely starving myself and that turned into throwing up and starving myself and it was just this crazy battle going on inside of me.\n\n\n\nEating disorders have their own stigma around them, with many people still refusing to accept that it's a disease, not a choice, and is its own form of mental illness. For Lovato to share her struggle, could help so many other young girls out there, and she continues to be open about that time in her life.\n\nWHEN SHE ADMITTED SHE IS BIPOLAR\n\nIn 2011 Lovato took a brave step in admitting to the world that she suffered from bipolar disorder. For her, she never even knew she was until she went to rehab. But with that knowledge in hand, she now hopes to share her story so that other people can get diagnosed before things get as bad as they did for her.\n\n\n\n[Cutting] was a way of expressing my own shame, of myself, on my own body. I was matching the inside to the outside. And there were some times where my emotions were just so built up, I didn't know what to do. The only way that I could get instant gratification was through an immediate release on myself.\n\n\n\nWHEN SHE ANNOUNCED HER SUPPORT FOR OTHER SUFFERERS OF BIPOLAR DISORDER\n\n[Twitter Embed: https://twitter.com/ddlovato/statuses/58620877209743360]\n\n\n\nWhen Catherine Zeta Jones was being treated for bipolar II disorder , Lovato made her feelings known on Twitter.\n\nStanding up for others who are also going public with their mental illness is just another way that Lovato is breaking down the stigma.\n\nLovato once said, \"I know that if I can use my voice to speak to one person, or one family, then I've done my part. I feel like it's no coincidence that God put me through all of this and has also given me the voice that I have.\" And through the work she's done thus far I'd say there's no doubt she's doing her part to help those suffering from mental illness.\n\nWatch her latest PSA with The Mental Health Listening & Engagement Tour below:\n\n[Embed]\n\nImage: weheartit", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/36034-6-times-demi-lovato-broke-down-the-stigma-around-mental-illness", "summary": "Now Demi Lovato is taking on the stigma of bipolar disorder, which the singer has admitted she suffers from.\nI'm Demi Lovato.\nBut Lovato did just that when she opened up about her estranged father's own battle with mental illness.\nI've dealt with mental illnesses, but my father also dealt with mental illness and he was not able to function very well in society.\"\nStanding up for others who are also going public with their mental illness is just another way that Lovato is breaking down the stigma.", "timescraped": 1513838489.786538, "category": {"words": 867, "personal": 21, "thirdperson": 48, "condition": 15, "recovery": 0}}, "bebc6f0f2a6c6618fad40a134bc34fc6": {"title": "Your Mental Health Record Isn't As Private As You Think \u2014 So Choose Your Health Provider Wisely", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost/2016/9/13/71bebc79-11a7-4969-bf2d-b044936c6d2c.JPG?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "text": "When you're mentally ill, one of your worst nightmares is being outed. Every week, I read about people who share my diagnosis being shot to death by police, injured, or killed in hate crimes, fired from their jobs, abandoned by their partners. Even as a journalist who is out about dealing with mental illness and fortunate enough to work for publications with supportive editors and coworkers, I still don't disclose my diagnosis, because I know the cost that comes with it. Disturbingly, in a highly interconnected society, outing is easier than ever before \u2014 and sometimes it's entirely unintentional.\n\nWe live in a culture where any horrific crime is accompanied by the assumption that the perpetrator is mentally ill \u2014 I often see my diagnosis bandied about in the wake of mass shootings, for example. We also live in a culture where to be known as mentally ill is to be treated as someone unreliable and untrustworthy, and where any expression of emotion or disagreement is attributed to mental illness, rather than to individual autonomy. Thus, the mentally ill woman who reports harassment at work is written off as \"crazy,\" the mentally ill man who reports rape is mocked by police. Everyone views us \u2014 the crazy \u2014 through the lens of our illnesses rather than who we are as people.\n\nIt took me several years of mental health journalism to disclose the fact that I had a mental illness, though some of my editors and colleagues knew already. It seemed a disservice to write about mental health stigma and the complexities of coming out without doing so myself \u2014 and many had read between the lines already. I also had a more concrete fear, though: The worry that exposing myself as mentally ill would undermine my professional standing, and also that it would make me a target.\n\nIf a hacker succeeded in accessing my medical record, it would be devastating.\n\nThe risk of documents about mental health leaking (doxing, as it's known) \u2014 which had already happened to me \u2014 increases with perceived vulnerabilities, and awareness of a mental health history could act like catnip to people interested in violating my privacy. If a hacker succeeded in accessing my medical record, it would be devastating.\n\nBut a curious thing happened once I did disclose that I suffered from mental illness, with readers seeming to split between hating me even more than they already did and others coming forth to talk about their own mental health conditions, sometimes publicly, sometimes privately.\n\nThere's a reason anti-stigma campaigns like Bring Change 2 Mind and Time to Change encourage mentally ill people to talk about mental illness \u2014 to show the rest of the world that we're just like you. To make it easier for others of us to come out. Nearly 20 percent of Americans experience symptoms of mental illness in any given year, after all.\n\nIn some communities, being mentally ill is extremely dangerous. Government workers lose clearance \u2014 and livelihoods \u2014 if they're outed or decide to seek treatment. Members of many minority communities deal with complicated stigma within their communities and violence from outside it; one element of the nation's epidemic of police shootings that isn't widely covered is that over half involve mentally ill people, many of whom were known to be mentally ill by police and other responders. Given the notable intersections of race and mental illness, there's a dangerous level of institutional violence here that goes unremarked.\n\nMost of those sharing my skin color who are fatally shot by police are mentally ill \u2014 I am privileged enough to afford the mental health care needed to manage my mental illness, to not be perceived as a \"threat.\" But if I had a mental health episode and those around me called for help, it's the police who would respond, and it's an encounter that I might not necessarily survive, which is something I think about when I walk by police officers on the street, see the lights flashing in my rear view.\n\nIf you're not comfortable with having your mental health records made public, it's time to ask your health care provider about their security \u2014 and to consider conducting a quick search to see if they've been the subject of any recent hacking scandals.\n\nFor those seeking tools to maliciously out mentally ill people, there are a slew of options in the digital age. People who know where to look can often find evidence of mental illness and may be able to narrow down a diagnosis \u2014 not an armchair diagnosis but an actual one \u2014 and this kind of doxing is used to promote the notion that someone's views and words don't matter, because they're only the ravings of a crazy person. Once out, that information can never be stuffed inside the bottle, one reason I tried to conceal it for so long.\n\nOddly enough, even the doctor's office has become a hazardous place for me \u2014 and you, if you're mentally ill too \u2014 thanks to the rise of electronic medical records, for which we have Obamacare to thank. One of the lesser known mandates of the legislation included a requirement to switch over to electronic records, one that on the surface seems extremely sensible, as it allows for instantaneous cross-provider, cross-system access to pertinent medical information. For those of us with complex medical conditions, especially people using an array of medications, this kind of information can be lifesaving, ensuring that patients aren't exposed to allergens, conflicting medications, or other health risks. It's certainly been useful for me on many occasions, including in mental health contexts.\n\nBut it comes with a darker side, too. As evidenced by several hospital hacks, those records aren't always well secured, resulting in the exposure of personal information \u2014 my fears about hacking, it turns out, are not entirely unwarranted. Along with Social Security numbers and other identifying information, such hacks often reveal private medical information that could be used for discrimination and public shaming, including mental health diagnoses, and many hospitals have taken few steps to address it \u2014 something I considered when choosing my health care providers, and something other mentally ill people should be thinking about as well if they aren't doing it already. If you're not comfortable with having your mental health records made public, it's time to ask your health care provider about their security \u2014 and to consider conducting a quick search to see if they've been the subject of any recent hacking scandals.\n\nThe problem isn't just hacks, though. It's also poor controls within the health care system that reflect limited understanding about the experience of mental illness.\n\ncoming out is dangerous and terrifying, but being outed is much more so, and medical records provide a very easy mechanism for malicious people.\n\nMy care provider is behemoth HMO Kaiser, and I have to note that I've actually been immensely pleased by the overall quality of care I get at Kaiser \u2014 and no one's paying me to say that. One element of Kaiser's health care programs that I really appreciate is their handling of mental health data. The hospital very sensibly uses a sort of \"walled garden\" system for its medical records, according to the conversations I've had with care providers, limiting access for to ensure that while every medical record contains a patient's total history, not everyone can see that history \u2014 though relevant information is always displayed.\n\nThus, my primary care provider can see that I visit a neuropharmacologist and a therapist, but she can't see what they're treating me for, though she does see what they're prescribing and at what dosage. Given the broad spectrum uses of psychiatric drugs, that doesn't provide many clues into my diagnosis. It means that I get to control how much she knows about my medical history, while she can still avoid prescribing conflicting medications and offer accurate health advice. Notably, Kaiser providers who need mental health care are provided with offsite treatment, illustrating that the hospital is sensitive not just to the needs of its patients but also to its staff. I haven't seen this kind of sensitivity in other health care contexts, but it also never occurred to me to ask. My therapist proactively told me, which makes me suspect that in cases where it wasn't discussed, mental health information was broadly accessible to anyone who could get to my medical record.\n\nKaiser is even more careful with records from its transitions clinic, which are kept almost entirely off book \u2014 prescribing information is available, and that's about it. Patients have to explicitly release information to other care providers, providing a high degree of control for people in transition who are concerned about their safety or other issues. Even subjects as basic as preferred pronouns are only explicitly added to the front-facing element of a medical record by request and permission.\n\nThese measures provide a sense of security and trust, both of which are key to a successful therapeutic relationship as well as a functional doctor/patient collaboration. As a patient, I know I can disclose complicated mental health issues to my mental health care team without having them spread across my record for anyone to see \u2014 if I see a radiologist for a chest X-ray, for example, she sees only the part of my record that she needs to access. That in turn means that I get better mental health care, and everyone wins that way.\n\nI have fought very hard for the right and privilege to be out about my mental illness, to be able to write both objectively about mental health subjects and to craft personal essays about my experience within the system, to tell the story and be the story. But even still, I am cautious about who knows how much about my mental health, an issue that's even more fraught for some of my fellow 20 percent.\n\nI work to achieve a world where our diagnoses are just part of us, rather than a weapon that can be used against us, and medical privacy is one facet of a much larger social issue. But it's one that many campaigners don't consider \u2014 coming out is dangerous and terrifying, but being outed is much more so, and medical records provide a very easy mechanism for malicious people. I live with an ever present sense of fear, and I want that cloud to lift from all of us. Living with mental illness is difficult enough as it is.\n\nImages: s.e. smith", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/105954-your-mental-health-record-isnt-as-private-as-you-think-so-choose-your-health-provider", "summary": "Thus, the mentally ill woman who reports harassment at work is written off as \"crazy,\" the mentally ill man who reports rape is mocked by police.\nIt took me several years of mental health journalism to disclose the fact that I had a mental illness, though some of my editors and colleagues knew already.\nThe risk of documents about mental health leaking (doxing, as it's known) \u2014 which had already happened to me \u2014 increases with perceived vulnerabilities, and awareness of a mental health history could act like catnip to people interested in violating my privacy.\nOne element of Kaiser's health care programs that I really appreciate is their handling of mental health data.\nThat in turn means that I get better mental health care, and everyone wins that way.", "timescraped": 1513838491.023412, "category": {"words": 1785, "personal": 50, "thirdperson": 23, "condition": 31, "recovery": 0}}, "e0425ee821efcb444c2541d0bea0cc8d": {"title": "15 Beauty Vloggers Who Are Open About Mental Illness", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost%2F2016%2F10%2F9%2Ff412cfbd-35d6-4d6b-82d1-335043f21906.png?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "text": "Struggling with your mental health can feel lonely for numerous reasons.

YouTubers who use their platform to represent those with mental illnesses, as well as speaking honestly about their own, help not only themselves but countless people who can relate to their situation.\n\n\n\nOne of the greatest aspects of fashion and beauty is how universal and diverse this world is.

Melanie Murphy\n\n[Embed]\n\nAnother video that doesn't just discuss anxiety, depression, and panic attacks, but addresses ways to combat these issues.

While in a great relationship, you might feel supported and loved through struggles with your mental illness, it can also make dating daunting and exhausting. PsychGuides, a company which provides surveys and guides that shed light on psychological disorders, surveyed 2,000 people to find out how relationships are affected by mental health and, while some of the responses were encouraging, there's still a way to go. A lot of people feel uncomfortable talking about mental health with their partner.\n\n\"I can understand why men and women don\u2019t rush to disclose their mental health status,\" relationship therapist Aimee Hartstein, LCSW tells Bustle. \"There is a real lack of education around mental illness and as a result a big stigma attached to a diagnosis. What many people don\u2019t realize is that someone who is actually diagnosed is likely to be getting better treatment than someone who is walking around undiagnosed. I recommend treating this kind of a diagnosis like all other sensitive, personal information. I would definitely wait a little while to disclose. This isn\u2019t first, second, or third date information. You want to make sure that the person you are dating is actually someone who you are going to have a real relationship with. And then tell them straight out and if you can, provide a bit of educational material for them (written or verbal) so they have a sense of what it is you are talking about. There\u2019s a ton of misinformation out there and you want to let them know the straight story of what you have been struggling with.\"\n\nStruggling with dating and mental health? You are not alone. Here's what PsychGuides found out:\n\n1. More Than 60 Percent Of Respondents Reported Having A Mental Illness\n\nIn case you need any proof that you're not alone: 64 percent of all respondents reported having a mental illness. So far more than half. Not only are you not alone, you're in the majority, so there's nothing to feel embarrassed about.\n\n\n\n2. More Women Disclose Their Mental Health Issues Than Men\n\nNearly three quarter of women have told their partner about their mental illness, while only 52 percent of men have. In an ideal world everyone would feel comfortable enough to, but we're still a long way off of that.\n\n\n\n3. And They Are More Likely To Share Their Treatment\n\nThe same is true for those on medication or seeking treatment for their mental illness. Only around 50 percent of men and 75 percent of women share this with their partner.\n\n\n\n4. It Can Lead To A Lot Of Relationship Insecurities\n\n\"For instance, relationship obsessive-compulsive disorder\n\nIt can be tough, with the most common insecurity being feeling \"not good enough\" for your partner, which about 1/3 of respondents agreed with. \"Some mental health disorders can greatly exacerbate insecurities,\" PsychGuides explains.For instance, relationship obsessive-compulsive disorder (ROCD) , a form of OCD, can cause unwanted thoughts and feelings that prompt certain types of behavior.\"\n\n5. Support Varied Between Disorders For Men\n\nThe amount of support men received from their partner varied. Of those with ADHD almost 80 percent felt supported, but for those with sex and porn additions that fell to 60 percent.\n\n\n\n6. And For Women\n\nFor women, those with OCD felt the most supported\u2014 or at least 78 percent of them did. But for schizophrenia, that dropped to only half of sufferers getting the support that they need.\n\n\n\n7. Most People Disclose In The First Six Months\n\nWhile not everyone discloses, those who do so tend to it within the first six months. But as PsychGuides points out \"men tended to wait longer than women to disclose their diagnosis, perhaps reflecting an observed tendency among men to feel more stigma surrounding their mental health struggles.\" But for men and for women, there's obviously along way to go to get people the security and support they need. Have an open dialogue with your partner.\n\n\n\nImages: Fotolia; Courtesy of PsychGuides\n\n", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/185463-how-having-a-mental-illness-affects-dating", "summary": "While in a great relationship, you might feel supported and loved through struggles with your mental illness, it can also make dating daunting and exhausting.\n\"There is a real lack of education around mental illness and as a result a big stigma attached to a diagnosis.\nMore Than 60 Percent Of Respondents Reported Having A Mental IllnessIn case you need any proof that you're not alone: 64 percent of all respondents reported having a mental illness.\nMore Women Disclose Their Mental Health Issues Than MenNearly three quarter of women have told their partner about their mental illness, while only 52 percent of men have.\nAnd They Are More Likely To Share Their TreatmentThe same is true for those on medication or seeking treatment for their mental illness.", "timescraped": 1513838493.5422568, "category": {"words": 655, "personal": 3, "thirdperson": 19, "condition": 14, "recovery": 0}}, "5bc10c1ddebad1a0663ccf60a7fce874": {"title": "Chance The Rapper Speaking Out About Mental Illness In The Black Community Is A Game Changer", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/2017/3/14/634977406.jpg?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "text": "The unstoppable Chance the Rapper is having a great start to 2017. With three Grammys under his belt, an adorable daughter taking over his social media, and what he considers an official debut album on the way, the Chicago MC appears to be on cloud nine. However, Chance opened up about having anxiety to Complex, as well as unwavering faith in God. The Coloring Book artist explained that coming to terms with his anxiety has been a new process for him, particularly because of the lack of discussion about mental illness in the black community. He told Complex,\n\nI think anxiety is also something that I'm just now being exposed to. A really big conversation and idea that I'm getting introduced to right now is black mental health. 'Cause for a long time that wasn't a thing that we talked about. I don't remember it. I don't remember people talking about anxiety; I don't remember, when I was growing up, that really being a thing.\n\nThe interview brought up the fact that part of his anxiety may stem from seeing friends die in front of him as a teenager. However, when it comes to coping, he admitted to Complex that he's apprehensive about taking medications. \"I'm cool with self [medication] \u2014 I like to smoke weed and s--t, to chill out,\" he said. And he also said he puts his trust in the Lord. \"I think I could to a certain extent have PTSD,\" he said. \"But, nah. I don't got no PTSD. I don't ever want to convince myself that I'm hindered by any of my experiences. I also believe in G-O-D. Everything that's happened in my life, [someone] already knows that that s--t happened, and what's going to happen, and put things in place for certain things to happen.\"\n\nThe rapper's fears touch on an unfortunate reality for many black Americans. National Alliance on Mental Illness cites several reasons why some African-Americans are hesitant to seek treatment and receive optimum care for mental illness. These reasons include: \"lack of information and misunderstanding about mental health\"; \"faith, spirituality, and community\"; \"reluctance and inability to access mental health services\"; negative side-effects from medications; \"provider bias and inequality of care\"; and \"lack of cultural competence\" in mental health care. Chance's Complex interview highlights two of NAMI's aforementioned mental health care hinderances: faith and lack of information.\n\nAt 23, Chance admits he is \"just now being exposed to\" issues of black mental health because it was hardly discussed growing up. And this is a prevalent problem. The Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health found that African-Americans are 20 percent more likely to experience serious mental health problems than the general population. The common mental health disorders among African-Americans include: major depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, suicide (particularly among black men), and post-traumatic stress disorder since black Americans are more likely to be victims of violent crime, according to the Office of Minority Health.\n\nChristopher Polk/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nNAMI says because mental illness isn't regularly talked about, \"this lack of knowledge leads many to believe that a mental health condition is a personal weakness or some sort of punishment from God.\" In terms of faith, the organization notes that spirituality \"can help in the recovery process,\" but adds that many African-Americans solely rely \"on faith, family, and social communities for emotional support rather than turning to health care professionals.\"\n\nSimilar to fellow rapper Kid Cudi, who revealed he struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts in October, what Chance has managed to do is help bring the conversation about black mental health to the forefront. The young star is doing an even greater service than offering his fans his story. He's raising awareness and changing the game for himself and others who grapple with mental illness and/or with conflicts of faith.\n\nAmid party songs about flashy lifestyles, the root of rap has always been in a message of sharing one's hardships, successes, resilience, and fears. Chance proves he has no problem speaking out on all of these topics, and he demonstrates that there is no shame in acknowledging your mental health, as well.", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/p/chance-the-rapper-speaking-out-about-mental-illness-in-the-black-community-is-a-game-changer-44499", "summary": "A really big conversation and idea that I'm getting introduced to right now is black mental health.\nNational Alliance on Mental Illness cites several reasons why some African-Americans are hesitant to seek treatment and receive optimum care for mental illness.\nThese reasons include: \"lack of information and misunderstanding about mental health\"; \"faith, spirituality, and community\"; \"reluctance and inability to access mental health services\"; negative side-effects from medications; \"provider bias and inequality of care\"; and \"lack of cultural competence\" in mental health care.\nAt 23, Chance admits he is \"just now being exposed to\" issues of black mental health because it was hardly discussed growing up.\nHe's raising awareness and changing the game for himself and others who grapple with mental illness and/or with conflicts of faith.", "timescraped": 1513838494.8256042, "category": {"words": 704, "personal": 13, "thirdperson": 20, "condition": 21, "recovery": 1}}, "7d82ce3a3c8c3b575a7007b086256d01": {"title": "How Social Media Affects Us: Your Brain on Facebook, Twitter, and More", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost/2017/6/7/736d33d9-cbd5-4f4b-84fa-e2719fdee9c0.jpg?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "text": "It's likely the first thing you reach for when you wake up, and the last thing you look at before bed: your phone. Perpetually glued to our fingertips, our phones always manage to bring a couple of their friends along, too. (You may know them as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.) It may seem harmless, but those hours spent double-tapping and texting can actually change your brain.\n\nAs technology continues to develop, our brains are having to adjust to these new technologies. Our method of absorbing information is changing, our memories are being impacted, and even the way we read is being altered.\n\nAs Michael Y. Simon, a psychotherapist based in Oakland, Calif., tells Bustle, \"Technology always changes us, as we change technology.\" In other words, our everyday Internet activities are more deeply rooted than you'd think. Here's the way our brains are responding to some of our favorite social media.\n\nYour Brain on Texting\n\nRemember Pavlov's dogs? Turns out, we're really just like them. A little history refresher: Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov was studying digestion in his pups when he noticed the dogs would begin to salivate whenever he entered the room, even if he wasn't bringing food. After a series of learning-association experiments and some treats, he discovered the simple ringing of a bell prompted salvation from the animals.\n\nOur equivalent? Text messages.\n\nExperts explain the triggering of our brain's dopamine system by unexpected actions or the buildup of anticipation \u2014 i.e. those heart-stopping moments when you're waiting for someone to text you back. Dopamine, once referred to as \"the Kim Kardashian of neurotransmitters\" for its popularity, is linked to reward-motivated behaviors and addiction. The pings and rings from your smartphone serve as \"reward cues;\" essentially training us to expect a little bit of information in the form of a text or notification every time we hear it.\n\nOr, to put it more bluntly, receiving a text message lights up the same area of the brain as taking heroin or cocaine.\n\nYour Brain on Autocorrect\n\nAside from the hilarious face-palm moments autocorrect brings, it turns out the function can also impair your reading and writing ability. Yes, research from the University of Calgary found that texting can have a negative impact on people's linguistic ability to interpret and accept words.\n\nFrequent texters were less able to able to understand new words, and were less willing to accept them, compared to people who read 'traditional' printed language such as books and newspapers. The study also found that the average number of actual words used by texters is more limited.\n\nYour Brain on Status Updates\n\nWe've all had those pensive moments when you're trying to think of that perfect caption. Turns out, one part of your brain is actually responsible for deciding what goes viral on social media. The Temporo-Parietal Junction, or TPJ, is activated when we think about sharing something, and who we'll share it with.\n\nA study from UCLA published in the journal Psychological Science placed students in MRI machines and tested their process of sharing pitch ideas from \"pilots\" they watched. The success of their pitches correlated with the activity of the brain's TPJ, which is known to help us connect to the thoughts and beliefs of others.\n\nSo if you're good at social media, you can thank your TPJ.\n\nYour Brain on Google\n\nWhat were encyclopedias again? Many millennials may find it difficult to recall the pre-Google era, but having all the answers at our fingertips can have its consequences \u2014 at least when it comes to our memory. Instead of recalling the name of an actor after watching a movie or debating specific stats of a baseball player, the conversation is put to an end with a simple Google search.\n\nBut one study suggests that constant Googling doesn't mean we're necessarily losing our ability to remember, but rather that the search engine is changing how we remember things.\n\nPeople may now have enhanced recall when it comes to remembering where they can find information, as opposed to the data itself. So when someone asks you a question about a specific historical event, maybe you don't remember the exact dates, but you might be better at coming up with keywords to search for it.\n\nThat said, not using Google may also make a positive difference, according to a 2008 UCLA study. In a group of subjects between the ages 55 and 76, experienced Internet users showed increased brain activity, complex reasoning, and more advanced decision-making skills.\n\nYour Brain on Twitter\n\nPeter Macdiarmid/Getty Images News/Getty Images\n\nIf there's anything social media has proven, it's that people love talking about themselves. And science would agree \u2014 some studies show that our brain considers self-disclosure to be a rewarding experience.\n\nToo much information? Not on the Internet: upwards of 80 percent of posts to social media sites like Twitter are announcements about people's \"own immediate experiences.\" (We're betting the rest are cat pics.)\n\nIn one study, researchers connected subjects to an MRI machine and watched their brain activity while answering questions about their own opinions and the opinions of others. The brain regions associated with reward, the nuclear accumbens and the ventral tegmental area, became strongly engaged when people talked about themselves, and less-so when talking about others.\n\nProving that people are even more self-centered that we thought, the participants actually turned down money (just a few cents) to talk about someone else \u2014 just so they could continue blathering on about me, myself, and I.\n\nIt's no wonder people use Twitter to tell the world about their every inner dialogue.\n\nYour Brain on Food Porn\n\nEveryone loves some mouth-watering food porn. Those delectably edited photos of your meal, however, can actually impact your real-life eating habits.\n\nOne psychologist tells Women's Health that food porn relies on a phenomenon called supernormal stimuli, which increases our desire for things we're already programmed to love. And remember our brain's reward center? Of course, that's in play here too.\n\nA study from The Journal of Neuroscience found the reward center is stimulated by the photos, and can even cause women to overeat. (Men, presumably, are simply too busy not torturing themselves.)\n\nSo even after you've chowed down, seeing a picture of food can increase levels of the hunger hormone ghrelin. And the problem is?...\n\nYour Brain on Facebook\n\nSome say Facebook is a rewarding experience, while others highlight the negative emotions it can bring. One neurologist says people may be driven to use Facebook by a desire to monitor their reputation, again linking technology to a person's self-affirmation and the brain's reward system.\n\n\u201cYou post something and then you wait for a positive social feedback in the form of likes and comment,\u201d neurologist Dar Meshi told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cAnd if you get likes, it demonstrates that people think highly of you, which is equivalent to reputation.\u201d\n\nAVbyte on YouTube\n\nOn the flip-side, Facebook can also prompt envy. All your friends seem to be doing so much better than you, and it can trigger feelings of loneliness and dissatisfaction, as many an alarmist study on Facebook depression has informed us.\n\nFacebook statuses also tend to be more memorable to us than some lines from a book or even a strangers face. (Sad, but true.) Our brains are more likely to recall patterns of speech akin to our own thought process, so unedited, naturally-worded posts that reflect our speech tend to stick.\n\nAny of this freak you out?\n\nOur brains are sure to continue to change with social media, but everything in moderation. Simon advises that the solution isn't to \"opt out\" of the digital world, but rather to take some time to unplug for a while and experience the real world.\n\n\"The idea seems quaint, but even dividing up the hour of the day into some segments \u2014 for example, 45 minutes in which you work online, text, or interact with a digital device, and 15 minutes of closing your eyes, walking outside, or making eye contact with another \u2014 can help mitigate some of the stress of constant interaction with digital media,\" Simon says. \"...Amazing, but humans seem to have limits on bandwidth.\"", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/20424-how-social-media-affects-us-your-brain-on-facebook-twitter-and-more", "summary": "Here's the way our brains are responding to some of our favorite social media.\nTurns out, one part of your brain is actually responsible for deciding what goes viral on social media.\nSo if you're good at social media, you can thank your TPJ.\nYour Brain on TwitterPeter Macdiarmid/Getty Images News/Getty ImagesIf there's anything social media has proven, it's that people love talking about themselves.\nNot on the Internet: upwards of 80 percent of posts to social media sites like Twitter are announcements about people's \"own immediate experiences.\"", "timescraped": 1513838475.133826, "category": {"words": 1354, "personal": 31, "thirdperson": 16, "condition": 1, "recovery": 0}}, "42f4475e3b4cec10e2692b2db8cf3550": {"title": "Why We Need To Talk About Addiction", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost%2F2016%2F12%2F13%2F916e4d4f-bbc5-4d56-8c84-938c45158dfb.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "text": "I vividly remember the Monday morning after Philip Seymour Hoffman died from a drug overdose. At work, as my colleagues and I debriefed about the weekend, I commented that his death was a terrible tragedy. I didn't expect that my comment would be remotely controversial \u2014 but I was wrong. I was stunned when several of my peers asserted that he was \"beyond selfish\" for engaging in drug use when he had young children, and that anyone who abuses or is addicted to drugs \"has it coming\" if they overdose. I fought back tears and, as calmly as possible, said something along the lines of \"I've lost family members to addiction. It's an illness, a horrific way to die, and no one deserves it.\"\n\nMy words were met with silence \u2014 no one apologized and, although they may have reflected on my comments later, they didn't ask questions about my loved ones or show any interest in educating themselves about the illness of addiction. I don't think any of these young women meant to be hurtful or callous \u2014 they had simply never dealt with addiction firsthand, so they jumped to their own conclusions without giving it much thought or reflection.\n\nIt's a disturbingly consistent pattern that I've noticed \u2014 many people don't think addiction is a legitimate illness. It's far more often viewed as the reckless behavior of a selfish individual \u2014 and thus, if the person struggling with addiction dies as a result, it's not a tragedy. All these conversations have made one thing very clear to me: we need to be more outspoken about addiction.\n\nIt's crucial that we all be as vocal as possible when it comes to addiction \u2014 because whether we've had our own struggles or witnessed the illness in someone we love, we can all play a role in breaking down the stigma. Being more open and outspoken about addiction could be lifesaving, which is part of why we all need to make a conscious effort to talk about it \u2014 even when it's painful, uncomfortable, and raw.\n\n1. People Who Suffer From Addiction Need To Know They're Not Alone\n\nA study conducted by Columbia University found that addiction is America's most neglected illness \u2014 40 million Americans over the age of 12 suffer from addiction, which means that more people are afflicted with this illness than heart disease, diabetes, or cancer. And only one in 10 people suffering from addiction report receiving any treatment.\n\nThe stigma attached to addiction, along with a troubling perception that it's not a real illness, likely plays a role in dissuading people from seeking the treatment they need and deserve. It's understandable that people are hesitant to talk about it \u2014 every time I hear people dismiss the struggles of substance abusers, I feel as though they're personally attacking sufferers I know and love, and it's hard to keep my emotions in check as I try to calmly explain all the reasons it's a legitimate illness. But we need to keep these conversations going so that people who are battling alcohol and drug addiction know they aren't alone, they have nothing to be ashamed of, and they are deserving of medical treatment.\n\n2. It's On Us To Educate People About The Realities Of Addiction\n\nThere's no getting around it \u2014 conversations about addiction are often uncomfortable and painful, especially if the illness has claimed the life of someone close to us. But we can't simply sit back and hope that other people will educate those who don't understand the facts and realities of addiction. Complacency is a pretty terrible excuse \u2014 so, if you have any firsthand experience with addiction, you're in a unique position to put \"a face\" to the illness. People often assume that addicts are easy to spot, but the opposite is true \u2014 plenty of people suffering from alcohol or drug addiction are high-functioning and successful members of society.\n\nAs hard as it is, I've found that telling the stories of the people I've lost to addiction helps others understand that the illness is far more complex than they may imagine. In my experience, the most effective way to get the point across is by explaining the factors that contributed to the addiction of a family member or friend \u2014 because many people with addiction have dual diagnoses of depression, anxiety, PTSD, and eating disorders. On the surface, it may appear that they're simply looking to have a \"good time\" \u2014 but people often abuse substances like alcohol, cocaine, and heroin because they provide temporary relief from an extremely painful daily existence. Being vocal about addiction fosters empathy and compassion for sufferers, and that's something they desperately need.\n\n3. Being Outspoken Sends The Message That There's Nothing To Be Ashamed Of\n\nShame and guilt frequently impede the recovery of people suffering from addiction. Every time we speak out, even in a small way, we send the message that this shouldn't be a taboo topic and no one should be ashamed of suffering from addiction, or being the friend/relative of someone with the illness. Shame deters people from seeking treatment, and this can ultimately cost them their lives.\n\nTo be clear, once someone is in treatment, they are responsible for taking recovery into their own hands and the fact that it's an illness shouldn't be used as an excuse to not fully commit to treatment. But, like every other mental illness, there are often setbacks and relapses \u2014 and people in treatment need to know that one setback doesn't mean they are undeserving of continuing the treatment that will restore their physical and mental health.\n\n4. It Helps People Recognize The Warning Signs In Themselves & Others\n\nIt's often difficult to pinpoint the moment substance use turns from a recreational activity (albeit an unhealthy one) to an addiction \u2014 and, of course, only a doctor can diagnose someone with addiction disorder. But, when we educate ourselves and one other by speaking out and listening, we're far more likely to recognize that someone in our life may be suffering from addiction.\n\nIn some cases, we may be the ones to realize that our own nightly drinks have turned into an unhealthy crutch. In other cases, we may notice that our good friend has increased their drug or alcohol use in a troubling way. When everyone is more vocal about addiction, we'll feel more comfortable starting a conversation with a loved one who we think may be on the road to addiction. And if we are worried about our own substance use, it's easier to ask for help if we live in a society where there's an open dialogue about addiction.\n\nBeing vocal and outspoken about addiction isn't easy, but that's precisely why we need to foster an open dialogue about the illness and educate those around us. Although I'm afraid the stigma will always exist, I hope that I'll never again be the only person in the room who believes it's a tragedy when a person loses their life to addiction.\n\nImages: Pexels (1, 2, 3)\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/199577-why-we-need-to-talk-about-addiction", "summary": "All these conversations have made one thing very clear to me: we need to be more outspoken about addiction.\nBeing more open and outspoken about addiction could be lifesaving, which is part of why we all need to make a conscious effort to talk about it \u2014 even when it's painful, uncomfortable, and raw.\nPeople Who Suffer From Addiction Need To Know They're Not AloneA study conducted by Columbia University found that addiction is America's most neglected illness \u2014 40 million Americans over the age of 12 suffer from addiction, which means that more people are afflicted with this illness than heart disease, diabetes, or cancer.\nBeing vocal about addiction fosters empathy and compassion for sufferers, and that's something they desperately need.\nBeing vocal and outspoken about addiction isn't easy, but that's precisely why we need to foster an open dialogue about the illness and educate those around us.", "timescraped": 1513838476.396775, "category": {"words": 1209, "personal": 43, "thirdperson": 27, "condition": 2, "recovery": 3}}, "b20c7cd908f2ad871b30ff64657601de": {"title": "7 Times Pop Culture Actually Helped Us Understand Mental Health", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/uploads/getty/2017/9/21/80acfe4b-7d3f-4380-a7a3-111edbe4fc6c-getty-840305194.jpg?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "text": "One in five adults in the U.S. has a mental illness, so it may be surprising that people tend not to discuss them openly. Medically speaking, having a mental illness is not unlike a physical illness, but stigmas and shaming prevent folks from speaking out. That\u2019s why moments in pop culture that help us understand mental health are so important. From TV shows and books that accurately and sensitively portray mental illnesses to celebs leading anti-shame discourse about their own mental health, pop culture often starts conversations that can have life-saving effects.\n\nWhile it\u2019s no secret that various media industries struggle to accurately portray mental illness without demonizing or romanticizing it, increased awareness about the impact of mental illness, not to mention backlash against harmful portrayals, has led to better representation. And even when faulty portrayals pop up, vocal criticism of them is as important as validation of good portrayals.\n\nIn the end, it\u2019s conversation that matters. UK-based Time to Talk Day, which takes place each year on the first Thursday in February, attributes increased issues surrounding mental illness to the fact that people often feel like they can\u2019t talk about mental illness \u2014 their own, and other people\u2019s.

The show follows high schooler Clay as he listens to tapes recorded by his classmate Hannah Baker, who committed suicide.\n \nWhether the showrunners' decision to portray the details of Hannah's suicide was a good or bad one, 13 Reasons Why and the debate surrounding that scene ignited a conversation about sensitivity to mental illness and the importance of trigger warnings in media.\n\n2. Demi Lovato\n\nDemi Lovato began talking about her mental illnesses years ago, divulging pretty openly that she struggled not only with drug addiction and alcohol abuse, but also anorexia and bulimia, as well as suicidal ideation. In 2011, at age 19, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and since then, she's been using her voice and presence (often at the top of the music charts) to boost awareness about mental health.\n\nAt a 2015 speech Lovato made as part of Be Vocal: Speak Up for Mental Health, \"her star status [was] hard to ignore,\" said Elle, which credited her with filling the room for her time slot. And she's continued to be outspoken to her enormous fanbase, having recently executive produced the documentary Beyond Silence, which follows people with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety.\n\n\u201cI hope that this film will show people that there is nothing wrong with having a mental health condition,\u201d Lovato told Variety. \u201cIf you do have one, you are able to live well and thrive with a mental health condition, if you are able to speak up and be vocal about the things you are going through.\u201d\n\nLovato's outspokenness is especially important when you consider that her fanbase, like most pop stars, has plenty of teen girls in its ranks. With her frankly addressing and focusing on decoupling shame from mental illnesses that often manifest in teen years, like eating disorders, depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder, she's someone for those struggling to look up to.\n\n3. They Both Die at the End\n\nSet in a world where you receive a phone call on the day you're due to die, Adam Silvera's bestselling They Both Die at the End is about two New York City teens, Mateo Torrez and Rufus Emeterio, who meet through the Last Friend app and agree to spend their final day together. While the premise alone is intriguing, the novel's appeal really hinges on how completely rounded and human Mateo and Rufus are, and on how they each react to their Death-Cast notifications.\n\nAs School Library-Journal points out, They Both Die at the End is far from the first book about teens who know they're going to die, but it subverts any attempts at \"tragedy porn,\" or glamorizing tragic events, and doesn't shy away from ugliness.\n\nThe perfectly depicted, debilitating anxiety Mateo suffers after receiving his Death-Cast call, as well as his constant struggle with self-loathing over how his anxiety has kept him in his apartment instead of out living a more socially engaged life, is written in a way that allows him to face his fears and push himself beyond his anxiety without shaming readers who haven't conquered their own.\n\n4. Jessica Jones\n\nWhen Jessica Jones went live on Netflix in 2015, folks quickly realized that, like its titular heroine, the show pulled no punches. The first season's premise hinges on Jessica, a superpowered private detective, confronting Kilgrave, whose own powers give him total control over anyone who hears his voice. Having previously been under his thrall, Jessica is repeatedly triggered. She has panic attacks and flashbacks, is often acerbic and emotionally closed off, and clearly struggles to maintain her own safe spaces while relentlessly tracking Kilgrave, aware that he does and will keep doing to others what he did to her.\n\nBut while Jessica Jones execs made the (incredibly smart and empathetic) decision not to show Kilgrave's sexual abuse of Jessica onscreen, they chose to show something else many survivors of emotional, physical, and sexual abuse often face: The fact that it can be so damn hard to leave.\n\nIn one episode, while they're standing on a balcony together, Kilgrave allows Jessica a short reprieve from his control \u2014 and she doesn't escape. Recalling the moment, and his insistence that she stayed with him because she genuinely wanted to, she explains, \"I wasn\u2019t fast enough. Getting you out of my head was like prying fungus from a window. I couldn\u2019t think.\"\n\nHer struggle is treated sensitively and empathetically, and it's a superhero-sized punch in the face to everyone who sneers at people who've been abused and asks, \"Well, why didn't you just leave?\"\n\n5. Chrissy Teigen\n\nDespite the fact that about 13 percent of people who give birth develop postpartum depression, it's a mental illness that gets little airtime. Thankfully awareness is spreading, in part due to celebs who open up about the often difficult thoughts and urges many parents with postpartum depression face.\n\nChrissy Teigen gave birth to her first baby, Luna, in 2016, and almost exactly a year later, in March 2017, penned a raw, compassionate essay for Glamour about her experience with PPD. She had a \"wonderful, energetic pregnancy,\" she said, but after Luna's birth in April, it took her until a visit with her regular doctor in December to find out her symptoms \u2014 feelings of detachment, chronic pain, lack of appetite and energy, and mood swings, per her essay \u2014 indicated classic postpartum depression.\n\nFor parents who have postpartum, not feeling like their child is the physical manifestation of all the joy in the world and not being happy following their birth can seem like a personal failing, but anyone in any circumstances can suffer from postpartum depression post-birth. Teigen says it best: \"Postpartum does not discriminate.\"\n\nTeigen's part in spreading awareness is totally vital. She took nearly eight months to be diagnosed, but her essay has the potential to help others in similar situations recognize their collection of symptoms as postpartum, and recognize that having postpartum is not their fault.\n\n6. To the Bone\n\nWhen To the Bone's first trailer dropped in June 2017, controversy erupted immediately, with some folks thinking the tone and content of the trailer indicated the film would present a romanticized version of anorexia. \"Netflix's [To the Bone] is just a massive trigger to anyone with mental health problems or any form of eating disorder, it is not helpful,\" said Twitter user @mxrganmc.\n\nBut in the wake of the backlash, others defended the film, its writer/director Marti Noxon, who based the film on her own eating disorder experiences, and its star Lily Collins, who has also openly discussed her own eating disorder.\n\n\"Having struggled with anorexia and bulimia well into my 20s, I know firsthand the struggle, isolation and shame a person feels when they are in the grips of this illness,\" Noxon said in a tweeted statement. \"My goal with the film was not to glamorize [eating disorders], but to serve as a conversation starter about an issue that is too often clouded by secrecy and misconceptions. I hope that by casting a little light into the darkness of this disease we can achieve greater understanding and guide people to help if they need it.\"\n\n7. Chester Bennington\n\nAfter Linkin Park frontman Chester Bennington's close friend and fellow musician Chris Cornell died by suicide on May 18, 2017, Bennington posted a letter to him on Instagram, saying, \"I can't imagine a world without you in it.\" Plenty of folks felt the same way about Bennington, and the shockwave from his own death by suicide on July 20, 2017 \u2014 Cornell's birthday\u2014 has yet to settle.\n\nIn the wake of his death, Bennington's wife Talinda has spoken out about his depression, openly acknowledging her late husband\u2019s struggles with suicidal ideation. One of Bennington\u2019s six children, Draven, issued a statement as well, commenting, \u201cI want to make a commitment that I will talk to someone before I hurt myself when I'm feeling depressed, sad or going through a hard week, month or year,\" he said in a YouTube video. He urged viewers to do the same and to seek help before self-harming.\n\nTalinda also posted a video of Bennington hanging out with his family, seemingly cheerful, and commented, \u201c[D]epression doesn\u2019t have a face or a mood. [\u2026] This is what depression looked like to us just 36 hrs b4 his death.\u201d\n\nThere are tons of harmful stereotypes about depression that can keep people from seeking help, and can keep others around them from realizing they\u2019re struggling. Talinda being open about Bennington\u2019s mental health and the effect it had on him is not a gesture of solidarity \u2014 it\u2019s quite possibly life-saving.\n\nThese stories and these people are part of a growing culture of increased openness about mental health and the effect mental illnesses can have on all ofus. With more positive representations of people with mental illnesses in books, films, and TV shows, and more people \u2014 celebs and non-celebs alike \u2014 speaking up, it\u2019s more apparent than ever that no one is truly alone in their fight.", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/p/7-times-pop-culture-actually-helped-us-understand-mental-health-2427638", "summary": "That\u2019s why moments in pop culture that help us understand mental health are so important.\nFrom TV shows and books that accurately and sensitively portray mental illnesses to celebs leading anti-shame discourse about their own mental health, pop culture often starts conversations that can have life-saving effects.\nSo when pop culture gives us an opportunity to discuss mental health, it\u2019s vital that we take it.\nHere are a few times pop culture helped us understand mental health.\nThese stories and these people are part of a growing culture of increased openness about mental health and the effect mental illnesses can have on all ofus.", "timescraped": 1513838477.856626, "category": {"words": 1755, "personal": 12, "thirdperson": 75, "condition": 31, "recovery": 0}}, "60da7fff5eb066ab17ecd29dd54acc4b": {"title": "How The Gun Control Debate Hurts America's Mentally Ill", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost/2016/9/13/9aceea5b-cc25-49e1-a329-268115b6f188.jpg?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "text": "Obama\u2019s face was wan as he entered the East Room of the White House on Tuesday. Leaning over the podium, the president laid out the numbers as he presented a plan for gun control: 30,000 Americans die each year from gun violence, with America leading the world in per capita gun ownership and accounting for about one-third of the world\u2019s mass shootings. Quoting Martin Luther King Jr., Obama cited the \u201curgency of now\u201d and announced that he is, once again, taking executive action to request federal reform of gun laws.\n\nObama has tried to introduce reform of American gun laws more than once in the past, but the contentious issue usually dissolves into gridlock. Obama's last major attempt at gun control reform, presented as a response to the Sandy Hook Shooting, was struck down by the Senate in 2013. At the time, The New York Times predicted \u201conly outside circumstances, like another mass shooting, might cause those who voted 'no' to reconsider their positions.\u201d\n\nTragically, there have been plenty of such circumstances in the years since \u2014 America has seen over 1,000 mass shootings since Sandy Hook. While many of these incidents fail to make national headlines, those that do trigger a cycle of collective shock and grief, followed by a flurry of debate on how to prevent future assaults. In recent years, the public discourse has invariably turned to questions of mental health \u2014 often with journalists and \u201carmchair psychologists\u201d speculating on which specific mental health issue drove the shooter to his crime. Commentators across the political spectrum tout the need for \u201cbetter mental health care\u201d as part of any gun control agenda, implying a direct link between mental illness and incidents of mass violence.\n\nOn Tuesday, this theorizing went on step further, as Obama included expanded mental health care as one of the goals of his proposed reforms.\n\nCNN on YouTube\n\nIt is significant that, this time, the president has asked for increased funding for care in addition to expanded data sharing about those deemed mentally ill. However, the discourse on a whole remains reductive. Not only does the conflation of \u201cmentally ill\u201d and \u201cviolent\u201d perpetuate unfair stigma towards the millions of Americans dealing with mental illness, it also serves to forestall important discussion on curbing gun violence.\n\nWhat Are The Facts On Mental Illness And Violence?\n\nThe vast majority of data about mental health and violence shows that people suffering from mental illness are no more violent than people who don't suffer from mental illness \u2014 only about 5 percent of violent crimes are linked to serious mental health disorders. Many of the most common mental disorders, such as anxiety, depression, and attention deficit disorders, have no documented connection to increased violence whatsoever, and research consistently shows that past violent behavior and substance abuse are far better indicators of a person\u2019s likelihood of committing homicide than a specific mental health diagnosis.\n\nOn the other hand, about half of all U.S. deaths by suicide involve guns. In fact, mental illness is more often linked with increased odds of becoming a victim of violence \u2014 for example, a person with schizophrenia may be five times more likely to be the victim of a violent crime than the perpetrator.\n\nThe popular image of gun violence perpetrated by a \u201ccrazy loner\u201d obscures other important realities that should be part of the gun control discussion, too \u2014 like the fact that most gun violence (85 percent, in fact) takes place not between random strangers but within social networks. Current discourse also overlooks the fact that gun violence is much higher in states with higher gun ownership, or that gun violence disproportionately affects communities of color and lower-income populations.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that some perpetrators of mass shootings have been diagnosed with mental illness, and that many of these horrific homicides were coupled with suicides, experts say that mass shootings \u2014 when taken as part of the much larger picture of gun violence \u2014 are such relatively rare occurrences that it is nearly impossible to draw any useful conclusions about patterns or predictability.\n\nEven so, blaming the mentally ill for violence seems to be a frequent point of consensus in the gun control debate, unfortunately. According to a 2013 Gallup poll, 49 percent of Republicans, 51 percent of Democrats, and 45 percent of independents felt that \"failure of the mental health system to identify individuals who are a danger to others\" was the most pressing factor to blame for mass shootings in the United States, ahead of access to guns or insufficient security at public buildings.\n \nBut as easy as these patterns of thinking might be to fall into, they generally do a great disservice both to those struggling with their mental health and those whose safety is at risk. Can these discussions possibly prevent future violence or improve the condition of the nearly 50 million Americans dealing with mental health disorders?\n\nAmerica\u2019s (Short) History Of Federal Mental Health Care\n\nThe federal government's relationship to mental health care is a mixed one. The term \u201cmental health\u201d first appeared in the legislative lexicon in the 1940s, with the advent of the National Mental Health Act. This legislation established the National Institute of Mental Health and represented the first-ever federal funding for psychiatric research. Nearly two decades later, the first federal funds were allocated to support patient care through the Community Mental Health Act of 1963. Further studies, commissioned by Jimmy Carter in the 1970s, led to incremental expansion of public mental health care in the 1980s.\n\nGovernment discussion of the links between gun violence and mental health can be traced back as far as the 1960s with the Gun Control Act of 1968, a bill that prevents those deemed mentally ill from purchasing guns. The relationship between gun violence and mental health received some research attention in the 1980s, but it was the 1999 mass shooting at Columbine High School that brought the debate into the mainstream light. In the decades since, it has become standard practice for policymakers on both sides of the aisle to cite mental illness as an indicator of violence.\n\nDespite the frequent, even bipartisan, call to address mental illness in relation to gun violence, little has actually been done to improve care for those struggling with mental health issues in the United States. Meanwhile, this line of thinking has served to lead many to perceive the vastly non-violent majority of America\u2019s mentally ill as future suspects. The focus on mental health in gun control discussions may at times even serve as a decoy for those wishing to avoid the more compelling connection between gun ownership and violence.\n\nCan Any Of This Actually Help Improve Mental Health Care In The United States?\n\nSo, is there anything to be gained from the current discourse around mental health care in relation to gun control?\n\nArguably, yes \u2014 if Obama\u2019s proposed funding is passed, the money would contribute toward the vast need for expanded mental health care. With this prospect, mental health caregivers and advocates face a familiar dilemma: Each time the discussion of mental illness is raised, there are hopes that it will bring increased resources for treatment. However, when politicians claim to be concerned about mental health without delivering actual benefits to those in need, their political scapegoating only reinforces unfair stereotypes and further marginalizes the mentally ill.\n\nBrien Kelley, Ph.D, former staff psychologist at NYU and now a private psychotherapist, told Bustle that he feels torn about Obama\u2019s new proposals. While he agrees that more funding for mental health would be a positive outcome, he fears that the politicization of the issue \u201cincreases stigma against a group not more likely to be violent than the general population in most circumstances.\u201d Likewise, many mental health care experts have faulted both sides of the debate for their \u201cmisguided\u201d generalizations about mental disorders.\n\nIt is difficult to say what the outcome of this current cycle of discussion will bring, particularly during an election season when sensational, clumsy rhetoric so often wins the day. Still, for the thousands affected by gun violence, and the millions dealing with the challenges of mental illness, there at least remains hope for sensible \u2014 and compassionate \u2014 reform.", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/134328-how-the-gun-control-debate-hurts-americas-mentally-ill", "summary": "In recent years, the public discourse has invariably turned to questions of mental health \u2014 often with journalists and \u201carmchair psychologists\u201d speculating on which specific mental health issue drove the shooter to his crime.\nCurrent discourse also overlooks the fact that gun violence is much higher in states with higher gun ownership, or that gun violence disproportionately affects communities of color and lower-income populations.\nEven so, blaming the mentally ill for violence seems to be a frequent point of consensus in the gun control debate, unfortunately.\nAmerica\u2019s (Short) History Of Federal Mental Health CareThe federal government's relationship to mental health care is a mixed one.\nThe term \u201cmental health\u201d first appeared in the legislative lexicon in the 1940s, with the advent of the National Mental Health Act.", "timescraped": 1513838479.283054, "category": {"words": 1355, "personal": 0, "thirdperson": 13, "condition": 40, "recovery": 0}}, "14897203a9c0f6a133c75b9dd2c37a41": {"title": "'Project 1 In 4' Illustrates The Daily Struggles Of Living With Mental Illness \u2014 And Breaks Down Stigma In The Process", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost%2F2016%2F9%2F13%2F4b7f9103-a1db-4080-9ada-60f5c87c8c54.JPG?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "text": "If you haven't lived with a mental illness yourself, it can be hard to understand what it's like \u2014 and when we don't understand something, we have a tendency to brush it aside or diminish it.

Even if we don't fully understand something, we still owe it both to the people we care about and to the world at large to make an effort to do so; to that end, Project 1 in 4 might help.\n\nProject 1 in 4 draws its name from a statistic that we should probably all be more familiar with than we are: 26.2 percent of American adults \u2014 that is, roughly one in four \u2014 suffers from a diagnosable condition. One in four. And yet, despite the fact that mental illness is quite common, there is still an absurd amount of stigma against those coping with it, ranging from slapping labels like \u201cweird\u201d and \u201ccrazy\u201d onto people to shunning them out of fear that they're \u201cdangerous.\u201d Furthermore, 60 percent of American adults suffering from mental illness received no care for their condition in 2010.\n\nSo, in an effort to break down the stigma against mental illness, the anonymous person behind Project 1 in 4 is illustrating \u201cone thought, emotion, or behavior revealed to me through a series of interviews with people who have personally experienced mental illness\u201d per day for 100 days. \u201cThese people are our family members, our friends, our co-workers, and our neighbors,\u201d the site states. \u201cLove and support makes all the difference.\u201d I think the fact that the project will be ongoing for 100 days is important; May might be Mental Health Awareness Month, but that doesn't mean we can or should stop caring about mental health awareness once the calendar ticks over to June.

My immediate resolution for the day was to decide how best to kill myself. It sounds extreme, I know; but that's exactly what living with bipolar disorder is like for me.\n\nI was diagnosed with depression at 19 years old, which must have made sense from the outside. Being bookish and nervous around people, I probably appeared depressed more often than manic: my \"ups\" were often spent in seclusion, hammering away at some novel or art project. It wasn't until I was 28 and going through a divorce that I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder by two different doctors, a diagnosis that felt more dire than depression but made worlds more sense to me.\n\nThroughout my twenties, it seemed like my mood swings got worse every year. Like hurling a sword at a hydra, every time I shed an unhealthy coping mechanism (cutting was an early one; smoking cigarettes came later), my moods kept coming back in increased severity over the years.\n\nBy the time I reached that diagnosis at 28, I realized I had spent all of my life so far doing everything in my power to manage my mind without medication \u2014 largely because it wasn't available to me, since my parents didn't believe in mental illness, but also because it was my \"normal.\" I figured I was just overemotional, painfully shy, randomly impulsive. So I took to treadmills and weight machines, cut way back on drinking, built up my support system, and started practicing mindfulness and meditation. I had made it this long without meds, I thought, so why start now?\n\nNow, two years after this diagnosis, I'm 30 years old and still treading in these rising waters. When the flat tire made me suicidal, it was my first hint that maybe I shouldn't be trying to manage this illness by myself. Especially not in my current situation, when simply staying warm or dry enough is difficult some days.\n\nThree days before the flat, my partner and I were woken up at 6 a.m. by a police officer knocking on the window, asking to see our IDs. As we scrambled to reach the glove box, he asked if we were doing anything wrong. The officer wouldn\u2019t answer the question. After running our IDs, they told my partner to open the door and step out immediately. He began putting shoes and a coat on, but they responded with \u201cOpen the door, or we\u2019ll break the window.\u201d\n\nHe stepped into the cold, shoeless, wearing pants and a tank top. \u201cAm I being arrested?\u201d\n\nOne of the three cops said yes, explaining that Nebraska was asking for his extradition. I knew what it must be for: he had gotten a citation last year on a cross-country road trip that he had forgotten to pay. Somehow, it had escalated to an arrest warrant.\n\nThe next few days were spent rushing. I had to figure out how to get money into a phone account so I could receive his collect calls from jail. I had to tell his job what was going on, while also trying to squeeze in my own work in the meantime and worrying about leaving the dog alone in the car. I started drinking nightly to feel OK with my aloneness. I had been keeping it together for the most part. But the morning I woke up with a flat tire, something broke in me.\n\nI had been in the midst of a mixed episode for weeks. A mixed episode is a toxic combination of the manic highs and depressive lows that can occur in bipolar disorder. It is the kind of perfect storm that puts people like me at a high risk of suicide. I hadn't started actively identifying these episodes until recently, but I can trace them back to my childhood. In second grade, I got in trouble for whispering to a friend during reading time. I resolved to run away from home, despite having two of the most loving parents there waiting for me. I wrote my resolution in all caps on the inside of a Lisa Frank folder and held it up so my friend could read it. My teacher confiscated the folder. This is how these moments feel to me: they come on sudden and strong, even from a baseline of feeling neutral or happy.\n\nAnother time in grade school I thought I ate a bug and came into class crying. My friend had to tell my teacher what was \"wrong\" with me because I couldn't speak. I remember feeling like I actually wanted to die, if the bug wouldn't kill me first. Senior year of high school, I had nearly a 4.0 GPA and perfect attendance. But one morning, I was nervous about a test in my first period class so I took a turn and drove my car into downtown Chicago. I'd never been into the city alone, and I'd certainly never skipped class or failed a test. It just felt, truly, like the only way to solve the problem at hand.\n\nIn my adulthood, here\u2019s what one of these mixed episodes feels like for me. First, I forget that I\u2019ve ever been happy. That low moment becomes my entire lived experience, past and future. It\u2019s akin to falling into a deep, dark well in the middle of nowhere, completely naked and cold. My brain short-circuits in these moments to one of two conclusions: I can either wait to die naturally and suffer immensely, or stop the hurt on my own terms. When my \"highs\" figure in, metaphorically speaking, I'm likely to believe I can build an airplane to get out of that well, or dig through the stone with just my fingernails. It is a terrifying, toxic combination of believing I can do anything and not caring if my actions result in my getting hurt or humiliated.\n\nDuring these episodes in the past, I have suffered delusions that make me act irrationally. I have maxed out credit cards on things I can\u2019t remember buying. I have believed wholeheartedly that I was someone else for weeks at a time and acted on her self-destructive impulses. I have physically hurt myself with whatever I have on hand. I have done things that could be spun in a positive light, too \u2014 like the weekend I wrote and published a 30,000-word memoir (and withdrew it days later, mortified), or the time I drove two hours to Denver to interview for a professional job I was completely unqualified for. Rarely do these impulses hurt anyone but me.\n\nOn the occasion that they do hurt others \u2014 like the time I adopted a dog and had to give her up months later \u2014 I feel like I deserve the ensuing feeling of being stuck down in that well.\n\nTo some, it seems like a character flaw, like I have no impulse control. I have wondered about this, especially when some tout the opinion that mental illness isn't real, that it's just a manifestation of a personality type.\n\nBut everything about the symptoms I experience from bipolar disorder goes against my core identity: I do have impulse control; I've committed to an exercise regimen for years; I'm not a hedonist, and prefer being in committed relationships. And I'm certainly not an intrinsically violent, raging, suicidal, or hopeless person. I'm almost always smiling. I'm almost always kind. It feels like my personality exists in an entirely different compartment than my illness. Like a sugar rush or an alcohol buzz, the effects of bipolar seem to strike me out of nowhere. It's not like a phobia or flaw I can anticipate, like avoiding playgrounds for fear of children or ordering \"no mayo\" because of an allergy. I could be having the best day of my life and suddenly want to crawl in a hole.\n\nI have survived this long without medication, but that morning with the flat tire, it seemed to sink in for the first time: if I had addressed my own health sooner and given medication an honest try, I may not have come to this place emotionally.\n\nI held this realization tight, like a pebble in my hand, and addressed the flat tire one step at a time. I loaded up my backpack. Because my phone was dead, I left a note on my friend\u2019s door about the flat. Then, I walked about a mile to a gym downtown, the only place I knew was open that early where there would be familiar faces. The whole walk, I breathed through tears, muttering a Buddhist mantra I\u2019d memorized years earlier. I imagined, to passing cars, that I looked no different than the other scruffy, mumbling vagrants wandering in the morning light.\n\nWhen I arrived at the gym, Matt at the front desk was welcoming and sympathetic, agreeing to help with the flat as soon as his shift ended. I called my partner\u2019s grandma and she was encouraging, too. Slowly, I revived myself, drank water, had some coffee. I rested. I came back to myself.\n\nIt has been over a week since this event, and this mixed episode is subsiding a little bit, but my realization about my own health and medication remains. I have no dogmatic conviction that pills will suddenly \u201cfix\u201d me. I have lived in my own head long enough to know that mental illness is a raggedly woven quilt of genetics, history, physical fitness, and environmental stressors. Knowing this, I commend myself for coping quietly with this alone my whole life.\n\nBut I also remember that flat tires aren\u2019t always going to happen in a safe neighborhood where I have helping hands nearby. Life will do worse, inevitably, and this illness isn\u2019t going anywhere. I am finally on a waitlist to obtain medication. My hope is that the next time I\u2019m faced with a struggle, I won\u2019t have to fight to exhaustion just to continue to survive. I'm beginning to see medication as a necessary something extra, like training wheels, to help me round the corner into a life that feels a bit more manageable.", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/156019-i-have-bipolar-disorder-this-is-what-a-mixed-episode-feels-like-for-me", "summary": "I woke up alone in the car I live in to a flat tire.\nIt sounds extreme, I know; but that's exactly what living with bipolar disorder is like for me.\nWhen the flat tire made me suicidal, it was my first hint that maybe I shouldn't be trying to manage this illness by myself.\nA mixed episode is a toxic combination of the manic highs and depressive lows that can occur in bipolar disorder.\nI held this realization tight, like a pebble in my hand, and addressed the flat tire one step at a time.", "timescraped": 1513838481.812047, "category": {"words": 1697, "personal": 104, "thirdperson": 16, "condition": 6, "recovery": 0}}, "7352484235797cbbf3af25df6380dc71": {"title": "How 'BoJack Horseman' Depicts Depression More Honestly Than Any Show On TV", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/uploads/image/2017/9/5/c1f50103-dc6c-4302-9699-97ccc3daff8f-bojack.jpg?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "text": "On Friday, September 8, the fourth season of Netflix's Bojack Horseman premieres, bringing us more tales from the life of a washed-up sitcom star who's also a talking horse. But while casual fans might see only a Hollywood satire, close viewing of the show reveals that Bojack is something more \u2014 namely, the most realistic depiction of depression and addiction on television.\n\nWhen TV shows try to depict mental illness, we often end up with reductive dilutions and offensive stereotypes \u2014 think Jessie Spano's \"so excited\" meltdown on Saved By The Bell, The Big Bang Theory's Raj Koothrapapali struggling to talk to women while sober, or pretty much any explanation of any criminal's behavior on a police procedural, ever. Even in rare moments when shows do get it right, they often lose touch with the reality of mental health issues at the end of the plot arc (ahem, Rachel from UnREAL). That lack of accurate representation isn't just frustrating; misinformation about mental illness in the media can increase stigmas, and make people who are struggling with their own mental health feel confused and isolated.\n\nWhile a handful of shows like You're the Worst and Crazy Ex-Girlfriend have indeed garnered praise for their characters' honest struggles with mental illness, BoJack stands out for its raw depictions of depression. It avoids easy answers or false epiphanies; instead, its realistic portrayal of depression has the power to make sufferers \u2014 and the people who love them \u2014 feel seen.\n\nIn a 2016 interview with Vice, Bojack creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg explains that the decision to foreground Bojack's mental health issues didn't come from a desire to make a statement; rather, it grew from from a determination to portray mental illness respectfully and in a way that was more based in reality than other shows:\n\nThe goal was never like, Let's really create an expose, let's really investigate this kind of thing, let's diagnose BoJack in a certain way. I think it was more about just trying to write this character truthfully, and taking him seriously. The idea [was to take] a character trope that is maybe a little archetypal, or that we've seen before, but really believing in it, and trying to be honest and respectful to it.\n\nAnd the show is honest about it, to an extent rarely seen on TV. Bojack is a washed-up '90s comedian. He is also depressed. And while plots in the first three seasons saw BoJack attempting to pen his memoirs and reignite his long-lost career, the show's real focus was often his self-immolating behavior, sexual escapades and a quest to find anything \u2014 be it a substance, another body, or any kind of pleasure or pain \u2014 that could make him feel alive.\n\neigenchris on YouTube\n\nWith this situation in place, Bojack commits to knocking down mental health myths \u2014 including ones shored up by many other shows and films, like that mental illness can be overcome by sheer willpower (Pretty Little Liars) or finding a partner (Silver Linings Playbook) or a moment of epiphany (Willow's magic addiction on Buffy the Vampire Slayer), or that mentally ill people are usually a danger to others (Hannibal, Dexter, and countless others).\n\nBojack shows that a person/horse's circumstance is not a determining factor in mental health. Bojack's wealth and fame give him endless privilege \u2014 but not a vaccination against depression. Characters fall in and out of love with each other, and see their prospects rise and fall. What we see as viewers is that none of this changes their suffering, that no amount of money or success can make you happy when your brain refuses to allow it.\n\nBoJack Horseman isn't just unique in the way it portrays its protagonist's struggles; the show stands apart because, unlike shows where one character is \"the depressed one,\" almost everyone in Bojack's orbit is dealing with these issues. Through its characters, Bojack shows the variety of ways people can react to depression: shut down and disappear, like Alison Brie's Diane Nguyen; turn to substances, like Kristen Schaal's Sarah Lynn; or put on a fake smile, like Paul F. Tompkin's Mr. Peanutbutter. Or, you do all of the above and more, like BoJack.\n\nBojack also takes viewers further into the inner landscape of depression than any other show, never shying away from depicting what it's like to have a disease that convinces you that you are poison, that the world is worse off with you in it, that there selfishness is in existing. In a Season 2 episode, BoJack's mother, after reading his memoir, delivers a monologue to him that was one of the most-discussed moments of the show \u2014 and which echoes what many of us who struggle with depression hear in our own brains every day:\n\n\u201cI know you wanna be happy. But you won\u2019t be. And I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s not just you, you know. Your father and I, well, you come by it honestly. The ugliness inside you. You were born broken. That\u2019s your birthright...You\u2019re BoJack Horseman, and there\u2019s no cure for that.\u201d\n\nCheesePleaseable on YouTube\n\nBoJack Horseman excels most in moments like this, where it examines elements of depression known only by those who suffer from it. As someone who has lived with depression my whole adult life, having a show like this has been invaluable. Every single character represents almost every facet and symptom I've experienced at one point or another while dealing with this disease that keeps trying to destroy me. There is solace in representation, in not suffering alone. Writer Han Angus discussed this at Nerdy POC, in an essay titled, \"Bojack Horseman Makes Me Feel Like My Depression Is Understood.\" The show's insistence on showing that money, success, and material goods don't help depression, Angus notes, are what\n\n...makes Bojack Horseman so special to me, I feel understood...Whilst I understand not everyone will agree with this being the representation of depression, I hope they know it makes some of us feel like we aren\u2019t alone.\n\nBut this deep dive into what depression can really feel like isn't just meaningful for people struggling with depression \u2014 it can also be helpful for those on the outside who know and love someone with depression. The show gives them an opportunity to understand what their loved one is dealing with, while also seeing themselves represented as passengers in what is rarely an easy ride.\n \nThis all makes BoJack sound like one endless downer, which it isn't; it's one of the funniest shows airing right now, and it does have pure moments of hope. It's honest about both the ways depression can pull and grasp, and the way that belief in a future can go on. The show juggles all these thoughts at once, just like we do.\n\nFor those of us with depression, yes, we might start to sink today. But there\u2019s going to be a day where you don\u2019t. That\u2019s why we take our medicine, and drink water, and go to therapy, and remember to shower and eat and do the tiny things we have to in order to feel alive. Sometimes, it\u2019s so hard to remember to do those things.\n\nAnd you have to do it every day. That\u2019s the hard part.\n\nHowever, as Bojack reminds us, it does get easier.", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/p/how-bojack-horseman-depicts-depression-more-honestly-than-any-show-on-tv-80926", "summary": "On Friday, September 8, the fourth season of Netflix's Bojack Horseman premieres, bringing us more tales from the life of a washed-up sitcom star who's also a talking horse.\nWhile a handful of shows like You're the Worst and Crazy Ex-Girlfriend have indeed garnered praise for their characters' honest struggles with mental illness, BoJack stands out for its raw depictions of depression.\nBojack shows that a person/horse's circumstance is not a determining factor in mental health.\nThat\u2019s your birthright...You\u2019re BoJack Horseman, and there\u2019s no cure for that.\u201dCheesePleaseable on YouTubeBoJack Horseman excels most in moments like this, where it examines elements of depression known only by those who suffer from it.\nWriter Han Angus discussed this at Nerdy POC, in an essay titled, \"Bojack Horseman Makes Me Feel Like My Depression Is Understood.\"", "timescraped": 1513838483.244398, "category": {"words": 1231, "personal": 20, "thirdperson": 14, "condition": 21, "recovery": 0}}, "01dd34f16415b4b83525c35cef742630": {"title": "7 Things Your Friend With Anxiety Wants You To Know", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost%2F2016%2F9%2F13%2F39036ae8-3be7-4b6b-9cd9-6fa2bf4ed88c.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "text": "If you're dealing with anxiety disorder or any other mental health condition, it is decidedly a huge struggle that impacts many aspects of your life. But while coping with anxiety when you suffer from it can be a challenge, it can also be tough for our friends, family members, and loved ones \u2014 especially since, for some people with the disorder, panic attacks and episodes of intense anxiety can seemingly come out of nowhere. I've seen people who desperately want to help an anxious friend feel guilty and helpless because they can't immediately talk someone down from their racing, irrational thoughts. However, just because you can't instantly save us from a tough episode doesn't mean you can't be a huge help \u2014 there are certain things you can do and not do that will really help your friend with anxiety.\n\nWhile you shouldn't invalidate anyone's thoughts or feelings about their mental illness, anxiety is like any other health condition, mental or physical \u2014 if your friend isn't working on the problem on their own, it's OK to give them a kind but firm push to get help for their anxiety . Encourage them to talk with their primary care doctor about finding a therapist and getting treatment. Anxiety disorder isn't curable, but therapy, medication, or a combination of the two can be hugely beneficial.\n\nAnother thing that's incredibly helpful is the support of good friends. If you're unsure of how to help your friend with anxiety, here are seven important things to know:\n\n\n\n1. It's Not A Bid For Attention\n\nSome people think that panic attacks and other displays of anxiety are just cries for attention, rather than real mental health issues. This could not be further from the truth. No one \"wants\" to have a physical or mental illness, and we don't just wake up one morning and decide to develop anxiety disorder because we think it would be a fun way to get attention. If someone is having a panic attack, it does sometimes bring attention to them \u2014 but that attention generally feels really humiliating and is actually the last thing we want.\n\nWe know that it's really tough to understand our thought patterns if you've never dealt with anxiety yourself \u2014 but please never invalidate your friend's health problem by simply chalking it up as a bid for attention.\n\n2. We Realize Many Of Our Thought Patterns Are Irrational\n\nOne of the most frustrating things about having anxiety disorder is that many of our phobias are irrational \u2014 or they're super elevated emotions relating to little things that many other people just get mildly nervous about. And we're completely aware of that; in fact, we anxiety sufferers spend a whole lot of time trying to reason with ourselves and think about ways to cope with the role that irrational fear plays in our lives.\n\n\n\nSo, we don't need our friends to point out the obvious, like that we're panicking over things that don't make a whole lot of sense. That being said, I've found that it's helpful when friends and therapists challenge some of my thought patterns in a compassionate manner \u2014 especially if I'm having serious anxiety over something specific. For example, if your friend is convinced that a small mistake at work is going to get them fired, it can be helpful to gently remind them that they have a good track record on the job, everyone makes the occasional mistake, and hey, you've made errors too and it wasn't a great feeling, but you and your career survived. If you can point out irrationality in a way that is supportive, not invalidating, it can be a great help. As Pamela Wiegartz, Ph.D. wrote in Psychology Today, \"While high levels of anger, hostility or criticism are almost always detrimental, some studies have found that focused criticism\u2014criticism that is not globally rejecting of the person\u2014may actually result in improved outcomes\" for people with anxiety.\n\n\n\n3. It's More Than OK To Ask Questions\n\nWe don't expect you to immediately understand everything about the illness. Asking questions (in a thoughtful, nonjudgmental manner, of course) shows that you care and that you want to understand as much as possible. Although people who haven't experienced anxiety firsthand are never going to know exactly what it feels like, asking questions is a great way to gain insight and be better equipped to offer support when we're going through a panic attack or just a generally rough episode. And learning about the anxiety is recommended for people supporting friends and loved ones with anxiety \u2014 the Anxiety and Depression Association of America says that \"[u]nderstanding what your friend or relative is going through will help you give support, as well as keep your worry under control.\"\n\n4. Don't Share Info About Our Illness Unless We've Said It's OK\n\nIn an ideal world, there wouldn't be any stigma against anxiety disorder. But since there is, many people are hesitant to open up to anyone about their illness. If we tell you about our struggle, it means we trust you to be respectful about both the disorder and our right to privacy. While some people are very open about their condition, others choose not to be and that is 100 percent their prerogative.\n\n\n\nSo, if you have mutual friends, don't just assume that your friend's anxiety is common knowledge and freely bring it up. I understand that sometimes friends may want to discuss a mutual friend's problem because they're concerned and want to brainstorm ways to help \u2014 but you should definitely check in with your friend first to make sure they're cool with you bringing it up. Ask them who else knows and find out how open they've been with their other friends and family members.\n\n\n\nWhat if they tell you that you're the only friend they've opened up to? While it's flattering to be the most trusted pal, I'm sure it may also feel a bit overwhelming and like it's a huge responsibility for you. If you need to talk to someone else or seek advice, I would suggest talking to a friend or family member who doesn't know your friend at all. Anxiety disorder is common, and I'm sure you can find someone who can offer insight without betraying the trust of your friend.\n\n\n\n5. We Want You To Take Care Of Yourself, Too\n\nSome of the most amazing friends are incredibly empathetic and natural caretakers \u2014 and they're probably going to be the ones we confide in first about our problems with anxiety, because we know they'll offer support and compassion. Part of a close friendship is sharing each other's pain and joy. But it's also OK to establish boundaries that will ensure you don't end up drained, exhausted, and feeling like you're responsible for your friend's day-to-day functioning.\n\n\n\nIf a friend consistently calls you 10 times a day because they need to be talked off a ledge, you shouldn't feel obligated to take every single phone call and let your workday and other social outings be disrupted all the time. No matter how much of a saint you are, you could understandably end up feeling resentful \u2014 and that would take a toll on the friendship. Just remember that your support is invaluable, but it's not your job to fix everything for your friend. It's perfectly acceptable to establish boundaries \u2014 for example, to explain that you can't really take personal phone calls during the workday, but you're happy to check in once you're home for the night and have had a little time to unwind.\n\n\n\n6. It's Helpful To Check In During Rough Times\n\nEveryone deals with their mental struggles differently \u2014 some people may call their friends a lot during tough episodes, while others will hide away because they don't want to feel like a burden. If your friend falls into the latter category, try to identify their patterns. Do they tend to disappear when their anxiety is at its peak? If so, they'll really appreciate it if you make the effort to reach out and see how they're doing. As Australian mental health support site Reach Out notes, \"Be prepared to offer your help several times, without being overly intrusive or overwhelming. Be clear you want to help them because you care.\" If they tell you they don't want to go out because it's simply too overwhelming at the moment, offer to have a quiet night in with them. They'll really appreciate the companionship and, more importantly, the fact that you went out of your way to plan some low-key social time.\n\n7. Your Support Means The World\n\n\n\nWe know our struggles affect you, too. Unfortunately, many people with mental illnesses have had friends bail on them because they just don't want to deal with the ups and downs. So a friend who sticks around, makes sure to get educated about the condition, and goes out of their way to help in small and big ways means the world to us. You don't need to understand every emotion or always know the right thing to say \u2014 you're making a huge difference simply by being there for us and being a supportive, nonjudgmental friend.\n\n\n\nImages: Pexels; Giphy (7)", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/120115-7-things-your-friend-with-anxiety-wants-you-to-know", "summary": "Anxiety disorder isn't curable, but therapy, medication, or a combination of the two can be hugely beneficial.\nIf you're unsure of how to help your friend with anxiety, here are seven important things to know:1.\nDon't Share Info About Our Illness Unless We've Said It's OKIn an ideal world, there wouldn't be any stigma against anxiety disorder.\nSo, if you have mutual friends, don't just assume that your friend's anxiety is common knowledge and freely bring it up.\nAnxiety disorder is common, and I'm sure you can find someone who can offer insight without betraying the trust of your friend.", "timescraped": 1513838484.526106, "category": {"words": 1593, "personal": 35, "thirdperson": 41, "condition": 30, "recovery": 0}}, "0f976f663b054e3f1d120bcb973ac2e1": {"title": "11 Signs You Might Have A High-Functioning Anxiety Disorder & Don't Even Realize It", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/2017/2/16/20a7737f-a061-40dd-bd21-0ae20aaba3fa.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "text": "When we think of anxiety disorders, we often think of a stereotype of someone dealing with debilitating emotions that leave them cuddled up on their bed. However, not all anxiety disorders look the same, and you might even be experiencing a high-functioning anxiety disorder, which means you're still living your everyday life in a way that seems normal, yet struggling with unwanted anxiety. However, just because you're able to keep pushing on doesn't mean you need to be stuck with these anxious feelings, and someone with high-functioning anxiety deserves to be treated just as much as someone who appears more affected.\n\n\"A person who experiences functional anxiety experiences remains able to move through daily activities without the burden of constant, severe anxiety,\" says clinical psychologist Dr. Carla Marie Manly over email. \"As such, an individual with functional anxiety may function and engage in life activities without the effects of anxiety being highly obvious. In fact, a person with functional anxiety may appear to be very calm. However, a person living with functional anxiety often finds that anxiety 'leaks out' in the form of nervous tics, perfectionism, over-achievement, or controlling habits.\"\n\nHere are 11 signs that you might have a functioning anxiety disorder, according to experts.\n\n1 You Have A Hard Time Sleeping Pixabay Your tossing and turning may have more to do with your mental state then the coffee you had earlier in the day. \"When you internalize anxiety and function well during the day, the anxiety may come out in the form of sleep disturbance,\" says Manly. \"An individual may have trouble falling asleep, or awaken during the night and have difficulty going back to sleep.\"\n\n2 You Exhibit Controlling Patterns Pexels \"Given the constant level of anxiety, you may unconsciously resort to controlling habits in order to feel more in charge of life,\" says Manly. \"Controlling habits are unconsciously utilized in that they allow an anxious person to control or anticipate any changes or variations that are likely to produce anxiety.\"\n\n3 You Focus On Perfectionism Pexels Another subtle sign that you could have a functioning anxiety disorder is constantly striving for perfection. \"Functional anxiety may result in the pursuit of perfection, whether at work, in personal relationships, or in unrealistic expectations of one\u2019s physical appearance,\" says Manly.\n\n4 You Can't Relax Pexels Self-care is important, but it can feel difficult to focus on your health when there are so many other issues on your mind. \"Low-level, constant anxiety may result in an individual being unable to relax and 'let go,' says Manly. \"Whether staying busy with work, home tasks, or exercise, the continuous anxiety results in an inability to relax.\"\n\n5 You Have Physical Pain Pexels Anxiety can affect more than your mental health. It can get to your physical health as well. \"Physical pain that is consistent is a sign of high functioning anxiety,\" says Dr. Sanam Hafeez PsyD over email. \"It's typically neck aches, shoulder pain, even a constant knot in the stomach.\"\n\n6 You Experience A Lot Of Negative Self-Talk Pexels One major way anxiety can shine through is through negative self-talk. \"You feel as if there's a gremlin in your head, a naysayer doubting your self worth,\" says Hafeez. These thoughts can become obsessive, and they are often intrusive.\n\n7 You Seek Constant Reassurance Pexels Someone with functioning anxiety often needs others to help them think rationally. \"After having a fearful thought many times, over it starts to seem possible that the fear could actually come true,\" says clinical psychologist Devon MacDermott, PhD over email. \"Many people will seek reassurance from themselves or others that their fears are irrational, not possible, and not likely, or they will seek a reminder that they are safe.\"\n\n8 You Have Repetitive Habits Pixabay Your anxiety could also turn into nervous habits. \"You bite your nails, pick your face, chew your lip, tap your foot incessantly or have some other tic that is the release for the anxiety brewing beneath the surface,\" says Hafeez.\n\n9 People Have A Hard Time Reading You Pexels Keeping your anxiety to yourself can mean that others have a hard time deciphering how you feel. \"You're known as 'the rock' and someone who is 'hard to read,'\" says Hafeez. \"This is because you are hiding true emotions and burying them. You seem strong to others or even 'stoic,' but eventually the bottled up emotions bubble over.\"\n\n10 You Try To Avoid Your Thoughts Pexels Because the anxious thoughts are uncomfortable and get in the way of your day, many people will go out of their way to try to avoid them. \"Some folks are able to distract themselves or repress their thoughts for periods of time, but the thoughts always come back,\" says MacDermott.", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/p/11-signs-you-might-have-a-high-functioning-anxiety-disorder-dont-even-realize-it-38777", "summary": "\"As such, an individual with functional anxiety may function and engage in life activities without the effects of anxiety being highly obvious.\nIn fact, a person with functional anxiety may appear to be very calm.\nHowever, a person living with functional anxiety often finds that anxiety 'leaks out' in the form of nervous tics, perfectionism, over-achievement, or controlling habits.\"\n5 You Have Physical Pain Pexels Anxiety can affect more than your mental health.\n6 You Experience A Lot Of Negative Self-Talk Pexels One major way anxiety can shine through is through negative self-talk.", "timescraped": 1513838463.65562, "category": {"words": 797, "personal": 2, "thirdperson": 10, "condition": 28, "recovery": 6}}, "e0f464535750bdf30613ea3640a76fb7": {"title": "11 Signs Of Anxiety That Are Particularly Common In Women", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost%2F2016%2F12%2F9%2F13661fd8-2d4b-4d8e-a7b6-12bbc11a1119.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "text": "There's such a thing as having the butterflies before an important work meeting or date, but chronic, debilitating anxiety is certainly something to take more seriously. If you think you might show symptoms of having an anxiety disorder, it's wise to seek help from a counselor or engage in holistic approaches to health in order to calm down, feel more confident and assured, and break free of the tension. Anxiety disorders are especially prevalent in women; \"men are somewhat more protected from anxiety because of their higher levels of testosterone. Testosterone calms the amygdala, the brain\u2019s 'fight or flight' center, and also enhances the natural calming effects of the brain chemical GABA. Culturally, men have been socialized to be more \u2018in control\u2019 of their emotions, so they may more often present with some of the physical symptoms of anxiety, such as racing heart, dizziness, vertigo, or insomnia,\" explains Rita Milios, LCSW, psychotherapist and expert writer for Pro Corner on Recovery.org over email with Bustle.\n\nAs a certified health coach, I work with clients on addressing mental and health conditions that can be hindering their ability to function normally or feel totally at peace in their surroundings. Together, we work on building a healthier relationship regarding self-confidence, composure and control under stress, and emotional regulation to get them back on track. Pressure stinks, and it's totally understandable to feel anxious. Still, getting the help you need to quell the nerves and worries and handle the situation will help you prevent problems and find easier and quicker solutions. Here are 11 ways to recognize that you may have an anxiety disorder, so that you can seek the guidance you need to start feeling happier, healthier, and way more relaxed each day.\n\n1. You're Reluctant To Seek Help With Your Anxiety\n\n\"The kind of psychology of and stigma associated with fear and with worry, both are which important symptoms of anxiety disorders, sort of dictate whether or not people think it's appropriate to seek help,\" explains Kristen Carpenter, PhD at the Center for Psychiatry and Behavioral Health at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center over email with Bustle. \"So it appears that men when feeling fearful or worried see this as different or pathological or they're in need of help because of it and therefore, more motivated to seek out help. Whereas women, the theory goes all the way back to the Victorian era in which hysteria was an actual diagnosis for women or neurosis were a common diagnosis for women,\" explains Carpenter.\n\n\n\n2. You're Also Depressed\n\nCarpenter explains that anxiety is often paired with depression, especially in women with an anxiety disorder. \"What we also know that women suffering from anxiety disorders are more likely to experience what we would refer to as c-occurring depression. In women, the picture is often more complex because they're reporting anxiety, fear and worry in addition to feeling sad and disengaged. It's hard to know what you're coming in for help with when you have a layered situation like that,\" explains Carpenter.\n\n\n\n3. You're Not Able To Function In Daily Life\n\n\"It's not a bad thing to be anxious some of the time, in fact it can be a very good thing. If we weren't ever anxious, we wouldn't try to be on time, we wouldn't get and go to work in the morning, we wouldn't budget and save money,\" explains Carpenter. \"But signs that your anxiety might meet criteria for disorder really have to do with the degree to which you're distressed by the anxiety and the degree to which it causes or maintains functional impairment and makes it hard for you to do the activities from your day-to-day life: manage your family, manage social interactions and that sort of thing. So if you find that your anxiety itself feels like it's outside of what would be sort of normal human experience, then it makes sense to find some help,\" Carpenter recommends.\n\n\n\n4. You're Always Worrying About Something\n\nEven if something isn't a big deal, if you're worrying constantly, you might have an anxiety disorder, advises Carpenter. \"There's generalized anxiety disorder which is a condition of excessive worry. Excessive, distressing and difficult to control worry. If you're a person who finds yourself worrying most of the day, nearly every day or much of the time, that might be something to consider talking to someone about,\" adds Carpenter.\n\n\n\n5. You're Scared About Being In Social Situations\n\n\"The next class that we would talk about is social anxiety disorder and that is significant fear of negative evaluation or being humiliated in public. Again, everyone is going to be a little fearful some of the time, especially in a public speaking situation or sometimes when you're in a new environment and don't know many people that are there, you're going to have that safety of familiarity,\" says Carpenter. \"But if your fear of social interactions rises to the level that interacting with people at a store or waiting in line or ordering a meal at a restaurant become really difficult for you, that might be a signal that it makes sense to talk to somebody,\" Carpenter warns.\n\n\n\n6. You're Having Panic Attacks\n\n\"This is a disorder in which an individual experiences panic attacks and that is an anxiety attack that will arises every quickly and sometimes triggered by a stressful event, sometimes triggered by nothing,\" advises Carpenter. \"Signs of a panic attack include: 1) palpitations, or feeling as though your heart is racing; 2) chest pain; 3) Nausea; 4) intense fear of losing control, dying, or \u201cgoing crazy\u201d; 5) light headedness; 6) abnormal sensation of tingling or 'pins and needles'; 7) shaking; 8) sweating; 9) choking; or 10) shortness of breath,\" advise Dr. Charles Galanis, plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills and Robert Dorfman, a research fellow at the Department of Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery at Northwestern, MSc, over email with Bustle.\n\n\n\n7. You're Scared To Leave The House\n\n\"If an individual has panic attacks and have that fear, then sometimes they will also avoid going outside, being outside, being in public places, which we refer to as agoraphobia, it's a fear of being out in the environment in which you can't escape...You're afraid being out in the world for fear that you won't be able to escape something that makes you anxious or panicky,\" explains Carpenter. If you are anxious about leaving your home, it could definitely relate to an anxiety disorder and interfere with normal functioning. Galanis and Dorfman describe it as \"a fear of open or enclosed spaces, such as using public transportation, leaving home alone, or being in large crowds.\"\n\n\n\n8. You're Constantly Worried About Getting Sick\n\nIt's not just anxiety when someone around you sneezes on your arm. \"You're constantly checking yourself, noticing that 'I've got a little bit of a headache. Is something wrong with me?' and kind of thinking that any little sign or symptom is a signal that something terrible is going to happen to you,\" advises Carpenter, can be linked to anxiety disorder. \"You go to the doctor a lot to get things checked out and again repeatedly told 'you're fine, you're healthy, there's nothing wrong here,' and if it doesn't calm your nerves, still, then it's a sign of a disorder.\n\n\n\n9. You're Having Compulsive Behaviors\n\n\n\n\"Those thoughts are often associated with compulsive behaviors (rituals that people might engage in) to reduce stress,\" advises Carpenter. \"It doesn't necessarily directly address the fear, but it helps the patient feel better to do the ritual or do the compulsion. So in that case, if you either have those intrusive thoughts, they're really distracting. Or you find yourself engaging in a variety of behaviors unrelated to your fears or anxiety, that might be a signal that you might be someone with an obsessive compulsive disorder,\" further adds Carpenter.\n\n\n\n10. You're Having Trouble Sleeping & Are Restless\n\n\"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) involves anxiety that is not related to any specific situation, event, or person. People with GAD may experience feelings of restlessness, irritability, difficulty concentrating, sleep disturbances, and fatigue,\" say Galanis and Dorfman. \"The general anxiety must last for six months or more in order for a diagnosis of GAD to be made,\" Galanis and Dorfman add.\n\n\n\n11. You're Advised To Take Medications\n\nAfter speaking with a therapist, if he or she recommends you take medication to treat anxiety or depression, it's worth accepting that you might have a larger disorder at hand, and the additional remedy could help you heal. \"Treatments for anxiety disorders include cognitive behavioral therapy as well as antidepressants like SSRI\u2019s (Prozac, Zoloft, etc) and SNRI\u2019s (Effexor, Cymbalta, etc),\" advise Galanis and Dorfman.\n\n\n\nIf you notice any of these types of symptoms or situations happening in your life, around your anxiety and mental state, it's possible you might be suffering from an anxiety disorder. It's especially likely if you're a woman (sorry ladies), as women are nearly twice as likely to be diagnosed with a disorder and to experience symptoms at an earlier age in life than men are, as explained by Galanis and Dorfman.

No shame. Yet if you're passing gas too often in a day, it could be a sign of a larger problem. Not only will the stink alienate you from your co-workers (just sayin'), but it can also feel seriously uncomfortable. Signs you're passing gas too often can be easy to notice, as you're likely to smell it, hear it, and feel it. Instead of reverting to the \"whoever smelt it dealt it\" saying, consider checking your diet and lifestyle for ways to decrease the gas and bloating for greater ease and comfort.\n\nAs a certified health coach, I work with clients on understanding their bodies and avoiding indigestion, inflammation, and bloating whenever possible. These three circumstances can make you feel weighed down, uncomfortable, and fatigued, so it's best to target whatever might be causing you to be extra gassy and have poor digestion. While farting is totally normal, and farting a couple times in a day is actually good for you (your body needs to show it's digesting food properly and functioning up to par), too much gas can be burdensome. Here are 9 signs you're way too gassy and need to tame it down. You'll feel better; I promise.\n\n1. You're Swallowing Too Much Air\n\nAccording to Dr. Lisa Ashe, Medical Director at BeWell Medicine, over email with Bustle, swallowing too much air can increase gas. \"Air swallowing or aerophagia is the major source of stomach gas. Too much Aerophagia, can be a manifestation of anxiety,\" says Ashe. \"It may also be enhanced by gum chewing and smoking,\" Ashe cautions.\n\n2. You're Farting More Than 20 Times A Day\n\nAshe says that it's normal to pass gas between 10 and 20 times daily; however, more than that could be outside the typical range of gassiness and could signify a digestive issue. If you're farting more than this amount, consider seeing a physician to rule out digestive issues or change your diet a bit.\n\n3. You're Not Absorbing Nutrients Well\n\n\"Malabsorption of carbohydrates can lead to increased intraluminal gas and flatus,\" says Ashe. \"Malabsorption can be the result of lactose intolerance or things like Irritable Bowel Syndrome,\" Ashe adds. If you're noticing a build up of gas, it could be a result of improper absorption of vital nutrients that your body needs to function well.\n\n4. You're Taking Antibiotics\n\nWhile taking antibiotics can sometimes be helpful if you're getting over an illness or are prescribed them by a doctor, other times they can interfere with digestion and cause gas, bloating, and discomfort, advises Ashe. \"An alteration of intestinal motility or bacteria (the colon has a normal amount of bacteria which live in it and help with digestion) can lead to increased flatus. Motility can be affected as a result of medications such as narcotics or prolonged use of laxatives. Antibiotics can alter bacteria in the intestine, cause increase flatus, as well as diarrhea,\" says Ashe.\n\n5. You're In Pain\n\nIf your gas is accompanied by abdominal pain and cramping, it could signify that your gas isn't normal and that there's a greater intestinal problem at hand, advises Ashe. \"If flatus is accompanied by abdominal pain and bloating, you may be experiencing malabsorption and could have allergies to food and or Irritable Bowel Syndrome,\" says Ashe.\n\n6. You're Eating Too Much Fortified Fiber\n\nAccording to Elizabeth Ann Shaw, MS, RDN, CLT, over email with Bustle, eating too many fortified fiber products, such as bars, can produce excess gas. \"The chicory root fiber often found in bars and other processed foods can cause stomach irritation and bloating,\" Shaw further explains.\n\n7. You're Sensitive To Specific Foods\n\nIf you have a food allergy or sensitivity, especially to gluten or dairy (which are both widely prevalent), then you're bound to experience excess gas, abdominal distention, and poor digestion. If you're eating these foods and notice discomfort, then consider it might be outside the norm, and you should consider changing your diet.\n\n8. You Have Colon Cancer\n\nWhile this is an extreme case, if you're passing too much gas, as in exceeding over roughly 20 times daily, it could be a symptom of having colon cancer, explained Julie Wilkinson, BSN, RN on Very Well. If you're worried, check with a physician to rule it out, and if you have it, such increased gas is expected.\n\n9. You're Noticing Change In Bowels\n\nAccording to running coach and personal trainer Susie Lemmer over email with Bustle, if you're noticing a change in bowels, such as going too frequently, it being too soft or hard, or it containing blood (rectal bleeding), it could signify a problem that is accompanying excessive gas. If you see this issue, check in with a physician.\n\nIf you are experiencing any of these digestive issues, it could mean that the amount of gas you're passing is too much and can potentially be dangerous (if not, at least super uncomfortable).\n\nImages: Pixabay (10); Bustle (1)", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/p/9-signs-youre-passing-gas-too-often-it-might-mean-somethings-not-right-26575", "summary": "Yet if you're passing gas too often in a day, it could be a sign of a larger problem.\nSigns you're passing gas too often can be easy to notice, as you're likely to smell it, hear it, and feel it.\nIf you're farting more than this amount, consider seeing a physician to rule out digestive issues or change your diet a bit.\nYou're Not Absorbing Nutrients Well\"Malabsorption of carbohydrates can lead to increased intraluminal gas and flatus,\" says Ashe.\nIf you are experiencing any of these digestive issues, it could mean that the amount of gas you're passing is too much and can potentially be dangerous (if not, at least super uncomfortable).", "timescraped": 1513838466.1815019, "category": {"words": 833, "personal": 3, "thirdperson": 3, "condition": 0, "recovery": 1}}, "734f504d5106d6aec296f3e6807b7466": {"title": "5 Ways Anxiety Affects Your Health", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost%2F2016%2F9%2F13%2Fd5115bea-6ac3-4c85-bb3a-5ed5c340d544.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "text": "If you're one of the 18.1 percent of Americans who are dealing with an anxiety disorder, you don't need me to tell you that it pretty much constantly impacts your life in unexpected ways; I'm sure you're familiar with the way that anxiety can turn all sorts of tiny everyday endeavors \u2014 from going out with friends to telling the barista what you want in your coffee \u2014 into an energy-draining Herculean effort. But what you may not know is that anxiety can impact your physical health, too. In fact, there's hardly a bodily system that good ol' anxiety doesn't have in its grasp; our digestive systems, immune systems, and even our lungs can start functioning differently after you've been dealing with anxiety for a long while.\n\nHow does a mental health issue begin to mess with our physical health? Well, anxiety isn't just an abstract state of being; anxiety is a physical process, and it also has physical symptoms. Since anxiety is related to the fight-or-flight response, when our brains send out the message that there's a threat on the loose, \"neurotransmitters carry the impulse to the sympathetic nervous system, heart and breathing rates increase, muscles tense, and blood flow is diverted from the abdominal organs to the brain,\" according to Harvard Health Publications \u2014 basically, the same physical reactions that our ancient ancestors experienced when they realized that there miiiiiiiight be a giant lion coming their way across the savanna. Over time, regularly experiencing these reactions can take a physical toll on our bodies.\n\nOf course, I'm not telling you all of this to shame you for having anxiety \u2014 far from it. Rather, knowing how anxiety impacts our bodies can help us take better care of ourselves \u2014 whether that means motivating us to finally start seeing a therapist to talk about our anxiety issues, or knowing that we should pay extra close attention to our gastrointestinal health when we feel some anxiety coming on. Knowing the physical health effects of untreated anxiety can help motivate us all to treat anxiety like the real health issue that it is \u2014 one that can be improved and treated with professional help.\n\n1. It Can Increase Your Odds Of Heart Disease\n\nAccording to the CDC, heart disease is the number one cause of death in the United States \u2014 it claims 610,000 lives in this country each year. Many of the risk factors when it comes to heart disease are either out of our hands (genetics, age) or related to specific behaviors (smoking, a diet high in saturated and trans fats) \u2014 but a few of them are tied to health conditions, like diabetes and high blood pressure, where keeping an eye on our symptoms and staying on top of our health can really help.\n\nAnxiety is one of these chronic conditions that can have a negative impact on our heart health. Anxiety can lead to a frequently elevated heart rate \u2014 which can put sufferers at increased risk for heart disease. According to the American Psychological Association, this can also increase risk for heart attack or stroke. And two studies \u2014 including one conducted with the Harvard Medical School and the Lown Cardiovascular Research Institute \u2014 found that among people who were already suffering from heart disease, those with anxiety were twice as likely to have a heart attack as those who did not have anxiety disorder.\n\nBut this doesn't mean anxiety dooms your heart health. Rather, make sure to let your GP know about your anxiety disorders, especially if you're already dealing with any heart health issues, and talk to them about what you can do to lessen your anxiety's possible impact.\n\n2. It's Linked To Irritable Bowel Syndrome And Other Gastrointestinal Disorders\n\nResearchers aren't 100 percent sure of the nature of the connection between irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and anxiety, but there is definitely thought to be one \u2014 according to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA), people with IBS are frequently diagnosed with anxiety disorder as well as depression. Anxiety and depression are believed to potentially worsen symptoms, as there is a connection between the colon and the nervous system; but also according to the ADAA, dealing with IBS can put people at higher risk for developing anxiety and depression issues, too.\n\n3. It Can Make Your Breathing Problems Worse\n\nMuch like the IBS issues noted above, there is a bit of a \"chicken or the egg\" question when it comes to anxiety and asthma \u2014 though many people with asthma and other breathing disorders have also been diagnosed with anxiety disorders, researchers haven't been able to definitively explain the connection (aside from the fact that living with a respiratory disorder is incredibly stressful and has potential to create extra anxiety in a sufferer's life). But the facts are clear: a 2005 National Institute of Mental Health study found that \"[h]aving asthma was linked to a 4.5-fold increase in the risk of developing panic disorder...And people with panic disorder were six times as likely as people without the anxiety condition to develop asthma over the 20 year follow-up period,\" according to WebMD.\n\n\n\nHowever, we do know officially that the presence of anxiety disorder can worsen breathing problems \u2014 anxiety has been associated with more frequent hospitalizations for COPD patients and more severe lung distress in a number of studies. So again, be sure to let your doctor know about your anxiety issues during any treatment for breathing problems.\n\n4. It Can Damage Your Kidneys And Blood Vessels\n\nWhile the Mayo Clinic's website says that anxiety in and of itself cannot cause chronic high blood pressure, anxiety can cause short-term spikes to your blood pressure , which can damage your kidneys and blood vessels, as well as your heart.\n\n5. It Can Cause Insomnia (Which Can Cause Many Other Problems)\n\nThough lots of people experience a night of terrible sleep due to worrying, those of us with anxiety disorders often experience chronic insomnia on a whole other level; I personally had one year of my life that I barely remember, because my anxiety-induced insomnia had me sleeping only four hours a night, every night. And much like a number of the other physical health problems mentioned, we aren't always sure if anxious people become insomniacs, or if insomniacs often go on to develop anxiety \u2014 a 2007 study, which followed the sleep habits of 25,130 adults over 10 years, found that developing insomnia was a common predecessor to developing anxiety, while the Mayo Clinic lists anxiety as one of the top causes of insomnia.\n\nBut no matter the order of causation, insomnia does more than just make you feel beyond awful (though it does make you feel beyond awful); long-term effects can include high blood pressure, diabetes, and even increased risk of heart attack.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nA lot of the time, our culture downplays anxiety disorders, claiming that they're not real mental health problems, and that people who suffer from them just need to \"try harder\" or \"worry less\"(uh, great advice \u2014 I'll get right on that). This attitude can often color how we treat ourselves \u2014 we may think \"It's not a real problem, I can deal with it on my own\" or that seeing a therapist or psychiatrist about our anxiety is just whining. But it's not \u2014 anxiety is a real health problem, and it makes a real impact on nearly every system in our bodies. You deserve to be as healthy and happy as possible \u2014 and the first step to feeling better might be taking your anxiety disorder seriously.\n\nImages: Andrew Zaeh/ Bustle; Giphy", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/162656-5-ways-anxiety-affects-your-health", "summary": "But what you may not know is that anxiety can impact your physical health, too.\nHow does a mental health issue begin to mess with our physical health?\nKnowing the physical health effects of untreated anxiety can help motivate us all to treat anxiety like the real health issue that it is \u2014 one that can be improved and treated with professional help.\nAnxiety is one of these chronic conditions that can have a negative impact on our heart health.\nBut it's not \u2014 anxiety is a real health problem, and it makes a real impact on nearly every system in our bodies.", "timescraped": 1513838467.4984279, "category": {"words": 1281, "personal": 34, "thirdperson": 6, "condition": 47, "recovery": 1}}, "415d442acc90047e5a94df6dfbfc0f85": {"title": "Is Weed Bad For You?

The number of people over the age of 11 who\u2019ve used marijuana at least once in the last year rose from 10.3 percent to 12.1 percent in 2012, while there was a 59 percent increase in cannabis-related hospital visits from 2006 and 2010. At the same time, public perception of marijuana-related health risks has declined, while THC levels in marijuana have increased. While the measurements were taken before Colorado and Washington legalized recreational marijuana use, the report is sure to factor into the ongoing national debate on marijuana legalization.\n\nWe thought now would be a good time to take a look at some common marijuana-related health claims and see how much water they actually hold. We'll give you both sides of the argument so you can decide for yourself.\n\nClaim: Marijuana harms the lungs\n\nArgument It Does: Marijuana requires smokers to take a longer and deeper inhalation than tobacco in order to feel its effects, and burns at a higher temperature than tobacco. As such, on a \u201cper puff\u201d basis, marijuana smoke is more harmful to the lungs than cigarettes: It contains about five times the concentration of carbon monoxide and three times as much tar. In addition, about one-third the tar is retained in the respiratory tract after smoking marijuana when compared with tobacco.\n\nMarijuana smoke also contains higher concentrations of certain carcinogens, notably benzopyrene and benzathracene, than cigarettes, and lung biopsies from marijuana-only smokers have shown tissue damage that\u2019s recognized to be a precursor to cancer.\n\nArgument It Doesn't: Despite the carcinogens, tar content, and tissue damage that marijuana causes, no study has found that marijuana use actually leads to an increased risk of lung cancer.\n\n\n\nTo take a recent example, a 2013 study from the University of California at Los Angeles concluded that \u201chabitual use of marijuana alone does not appear to lead to significant abnormalities in lung function,\u201d and furthermore, \u201cfindings from a limited number of well-designed epidemiological studies do not suggest an increased risk for the development of either lung or upper airway cancer from light or moderate use.\u201d This confirmed the findings of a 2004 study from Washington State and 2006 study published by the American Association for Cancer Research.\n\n[Embed]\n\nOf course, when baked and ingested orally, marijuana has no effect whatsoever on the lungs.\n\n\n\nClaim: Marijuana has an adverse effect on brain development\n\nArgument It Does: Numerous studies have concluded that early marijuana use, particularly during the teenage years, has measurable effects both on brain structure and cognitive performance. In a 2013 study published in Oxford University Press, researchers observed \u201ccannabis-related shape differences\u201d in numerous parts of the brain in marijuana smokers, and \u201csubcortical neuroanatomical differences\u201d between those who smoke and those who don\u2019t. It also found that people who smoke marijuana have poorer working memory, a conclusion that\u2019s been backed up by other studies.\n\n\n\nIn addition, people who begin smoking marijuana during their late teens have been found to have shorter attention spans, poorer visual search abilities, and worse abstract reasoning skills. One study also found that people who start smoking marijuana as teens have lower IQs as adults \u2014 and even when they stop smoking, their IQs don\u2019t increase.\n\nArgument It Doesn't: It\u2019s very difficult to determine whether the relationship between brain functioning and marijuana use is actually causal or merely correlative. The problem is confounding factors \u2014 especially socioeconomic status, which is correlated both with poorer cognitive functioning and early exposure to marijuana. Researchers in Norway concluded in 2013 that most, if not all, of the correlation between neuropsychological function and marijuana use can potentially be chalked up differences in socioeconomic status between smokers and non-smokers.\n\nEducation is another confounding factor. Mandatory schooling gives people a boost in their IQ, but that boost slowly disappears as schooling ends. As a result, people who don\u2019t go to college often show decreases in IQ during their 20s \u2014 and such people are also more likely to be marijuana smokers.\n\nClaim: Marijuana is addictive\n\nArgument It Is: Strictly speaking, marijuana has the potential to be addictive. Around nine percent of people who smoke marijuana develop a dependency that causes problems in their work and relationships; that number increases to 17 percent for smokers who start young, and 25-50 percent for people who smoke it every day.\n\n\n\nArgument It Isn't: An addiction rate of nine percent is amongst the lowest of any commonly-used drug in the country. It\u2019s less than tobacco (32 percent), heroin (23 percent), cocaine (17 percent) and alcohol (15 percent). Over half of all Americans report having used marijuana by their 20s, compared with two percent for heroin, and yet heroin users account for almost as large a share of addicts in treatment (14 percent) as do marijuana users (16 percent).\n\nWhile most addiction specialists reject the dichotomy of \u201cphysical vs. psychological\u201d addiction, the potential for physical harm can\u2019t be entirely ignored in conversations about addiction. For example, one of the big reasons heroin and cocaine addictions are so dangerous is the potential for overdose, which can be fatal. Nobody has ever once died from a marijuana overdose. Alcohol withdrawal, meanwhile, can literally kill you, while marijuana withdrawal, in the words of one expert, \u201cis annoying, but isn\u2019t life-threatening.\u201d\n\nClaim: Marijuana is a gateway drug\n\nArgument It Is: A 2012 Yale study found that, amongst men and women between 18 and 25, those who\u2019d previously used marijuana were more than twice as likely to have prescription drug abuse problems than those who were always pot-free.\n\n\n\nArgument It Isn't: That Yale study also found that alcohol and tobacco use were substantially more predictive of prescription drug abuse than marijuana: While 34 percent of those with prescription drug problems had used marijuana, 56 percent had started by smoking cigarettes, while 57 got their start with alcohol. So, if those statistics are proof of a gateway effect, cigarettes and alcohol are bigger gateway drugs than marijuana.\n\nBut these statistics aren\u2019t proof of a gateway effect, because once again, correlation isn\u2019t causation. In fact, researchers have consistently found that there isn\u2019t a causal effect. In 1999, Congress commissioned a study on marijuana\u2019s status as a gateway drug; the commission found \u201cno conclusive evidence that the drug effects of marijuana are causally linked to the subsequent abuse of other illicit drugs,\u201d and concluded that \u201cmost drug users begin with alcohol and nicotine before marijuana.\u201d This finding was confirmed in 2003, and again in 2006.\n\n[Embed]\n\nImages: Ecard, Tumblr\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/29584-is-weed-bad-for-you-the-arguments-for-and-against-marijuanas-supposed-health-risks", "summary": "In addition, about one-third the tar is retained in the respiratory tract after smoking marijuana when compared with tobacco.\nIt also found that people who smoke marijuana have poorer working memory, a conclusion that\u2019s been backed up by other studies.\nAs a result, people who don\u2019t go to college often show decreases in IQ during their 20s \u2014 and such people are also more likely to be marijuana smokers.\nSo, if those statistics are proof of a gateway effect, cigarettes and alcohol are bigger gateway drugs than marijuana.\nBut these statistics aren\u2019t proof of a gateway effect, because once again, correlation isn\u2019t causation.", "timescraped": 1513838469.0581, "category": {"words": 1089, "personal": 1, "thirdperson": 9, "condition": 0, "recovery": 2}}, "03586deec5549e50574dc4b2ea1e3b2f": {"title": "5 Scientific Reasons You Should Go To Bed On Time", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost/2016/9/13/1077140c-268c-4147-ae12-2dd5fee03f11.jpg?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "text": "It's the age old question: should I stay up late or go to bed? If you're anything like me, when you're deliberating this quandary, you're already at the point where your work has piled up, your mind is racing, and you cannot imagine getting a restful night's sleep. On the other hand, you look at your bed and can absolutely imagine passing out and waking up early to accomplish your goals... that is, if you remember to set your alarm.\n\nFor me personally, I all too often pull an all-nighter \u2014 but while I technically accomplish my goals by doing so, I'm always groggy and disoriented the following day. The science behind this isn't surprising: after the adrenaline that initially kept you awake all night wears off, your body is in a worse place during your work day than it was in the wee hours of the morning. David Dinges of the University of Pennsylvania explains that because you've thrown off your body's natural rhythm, once 24 hours from the time you normally wake up passes, you're going to have a really hard time staying awake and functioning normally.\n\nSo, why do we do it? For many of us, school work piles up, final exams arrive sooner than we'd like, or we're struggling to balance work and personal obligations. Some people also experience anxiety at night, and feel that accomplishing as much as possible before bed is necessary to ease their worries.\n\nAll of this said, guess what? Staying up late really is bad for your health. Here are some of the scariest ways staying up late can affect your health \u2014 which, incidentally, also double as scientifically-backed reasons for why you should go to bed on time in the first place.\n\n1. Kiss Your Memories Goodbye\n\nAll of that studying you did? You know, all of those facts and formulas you wrote on flashcards and repeated back to yourself at 3 a.m.? Unfortunately, staying up late really messes with your memory, so it's very likely that come test time, you won't remember much of what you stayed up reviewing. How come? Basically, the hippocampus part of your brain helps you remember things by replaying it in your mind while you sleep. No sleep therefore equals lots of problems for your long term memory.\n\n2. Hello, Poor Judgment\n\nStaying up late can have really adverse affects on your judgment. You know how delicious yet relaxed you feel after you pull an all-nighter (or heck, even just go on too little sleep), where the world is at your fingertips and you want to follow all of your impulses? That's because a lack of sleep causes your prefrontal cortex to stop working as efficiently \u2014 which is a problem, because that's the part of your brain responsible for you making good and smart decisions.\n\n3. You Are Going to Eat Everything\n\nIt's true: The night munchies are totally a thing. The science behind this unfortunate reality, in simple terms, is basically that sleep deprivation affects your levels of peptides, which in turn cause an increase in your appetite. According to a study out of the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, \"late-night sleepers eat 248 more calories a day than those who get to bed at a decent hour, and all of that can lead to about two pounds per month.\" Apparently, night owls also eat more fast food and less fruit and vegetables, though the study does clarify they don't know if night owls choose unhealthy food because they're night owls, or because it's simply what is available to them at the time.\n\nIt goes without saying that you should eat whatever the heck you want to; however, if you're actively trying to get more fruits and veggies into your diet, staying up late might make accomplishing your goals a little harder. Just something to keep in mind, if that's a thing that concerns you.\n\n4. You May Become Prone to Negative Thoughts & Anxiety\n\nThere's been a lot of research done on this point, and for good reason: Mental health is no joke, and the effects of our sleep schedules make a major impact on our moods and emotions. Research shows that sleep deprivation boosts anxiety, which is actually a huge issue, as many people who suffer from anxiety disorders also experience difficulty sleeping. Even for people who don't necessarily have anxiety disorders, going without sleep, or going to sleep for short periods of time after staying up late, is linked with experiencing negative thoughts than those who sleep regular hours.\n\n5. You Are Going to Tank Your Immune System\n\nStaying up late to be \"more productive\" is definitely going to backfire on you if you end up calling out of work or school because you're sick. And, lo and behold, staying up late, or missing sleep entirely, is linked again and again to a terrible immune system. Basically, when you throw off your body's internal clock, you're also throwing off your body's programs for fighting off bacteria and keeping you healthy.\n\nSo, what's the solution? Seriously: get enough sleep. There are a ton of benefits to going to bed early, including more energy and better, healthier skin. More sleep can also help you think better and solve more complex problems, as well as help you regulate your emotions and interactions with others.\n\nImages: Pexels; Giphy (6)", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/135893-5-scientific-reasons-you-should-go-to-bed-on-time", "summary": "It's the age old question: should I stay up late or go to bed?\nSome people also experience anxiety at night, and feel that accomplishing as much as possible before bed is necessary to ease their worries.\nStaying up late really is bad for your health.\nHere are some of the scariest ways staying up late can affect your health \u2014 which, incidentally, also double as scientifically-backed reasons for why you should go to bed on time in the first place.\nThere are a ton of benefits to going to bed early, including more energy and better, healthier skin.", "timescraped": 1513838470.5065558, "category": {"words": 910, "personal": 10, "thirdperson": 4, "condition": 4, "recovery": 1}}, "8ef4c016728b76a0d73ca07f4c60a82d": {"title": "11 Signs Someone Might Have A Personality Disorder", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost%2F2016%2F9%2F13%2F01cb955b-5f61-4e35-a7e0-a12e78946a5f.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "text": "Figuring out that you have a personality disorder can feel a bit like deciphering one of those Magic Eye pictures. There's the \"a ha!\" moment when you can see your life clearly, and suddenly all your eccentricities and difficulties make a helluva lot of sense. But then there's figuring out signs someone has a personality disorder, as in a friend, family member, or partner. It's not as gratifying, but it sure can come in handy when navigating your relationships.\n\nThat's because helping someone with a personality disorder can be pretty challenging. \"A personality disorder is a deeply ingrained and maladaptive pattern of behavior of a specified kind ... causing long-term difficulties in personal relationships or in functioning in society,\" says psychologist Nicole Martinez, Psy.D., LCPC, in an email to Bustle. \"They impact all areas of life, relationship, work, socialization, and legal issues.\"\n\nOf course there are many different types of personality disorders, and each one has different symptoms. As Martinez says, \"There are ones that are narcissistic in nature, ones that are dependent in nature. Other's are erratic with self-destructive behaviors, while others cause people to lash out at others.\" In fact, there are ten total personality disorders, which fall under three clusters: odd or eccentric disorders; dramatic, emotional or erratic disorders; and anxious or fearful disorders, according to Psychology Today.\n\nOne common link between all the types is that a personality disorder can be incredibly difficult to treat, Martinez says. All the more reason to be super understanding when it comes to dealing with a friend, family member, or partner who is struggling with the disorder. With that in mind, here are a few signs someone you know may have a personality disorder, as well as which disorder it might be.\n\nCheck Out: Personalities: Personality Disorders, Mental Disorders, and Psychotic Disorders, $10, Amazon\n\n1. They Are Incredibly Paranoid All The Time\n\nEveryone is distrustful and suspicious from time to time, but the feeling can get a bit out of hand, as is the case with a paranoid personality disorder. \"Paranoid personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive distrust of others, including ... friends, family, and [partners],\" said Neel Burton, M.D., on Psychology Today. \"As a result, the person is guarded and suspicious, and constantly on the lookout for clues or suggestions to validate his fears. He also has a strong sense of personal rights: he is overly sensitive to setbacks and rebuffs, easily feels shame and humiliation, and persistently bears grudges.\"\n\n\n\n2. They Prefer To Be Alone Beyond A Healthy Degree\n\nThere's a normal, healthy desire to be alone. And then there's a level of social detachment that may signal a personality disorder, as is the case with schizoid personality disorder. According to the Mayo Clinic, schizoid personality disorder is marked by a lack of interest in social or personal relationships. A person with the disorder may prefer to be alone, they may limit their range of emotional expression, and they may even lack the ability to take pleasure in most activities. In short, they come off as cold and indifferent to others.\n\n\n\n3. They Have Extreme Beliefs, Obsessions, Or Magical Thinking\n\nDo you know someone who is way too into superstitious? As in, they won't even talk about Friday the 13th because of its negative connotations? If that sounds familiar, it could just be they have schizotypal personality disorder. As Burton said, \"Schizotypal PD is characterized by oddities of appearance, behavior, and speech, unusual perceptual experiences, and anomalies of thinking similar to those seen in schizophrenia. These latter can include odd beliefs, magical thinking ... suspiciousness, and obsessive ruminations. People with schizotypal PD often fear social interaction and think of others as harmful.\"\n\n\n\n4. They Don't Respect The Rights Of Others\n\nLet's say you have a family member who has a strong disregard for your feelings. As in, they don't care at all when it comes to putting you down, lying to your face, or putting you in danger. It could be their antisocial personality disorder on full display. According to an article in Psychology Today, \"Antisocial personality disorder is characterized by a pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of others ... People with this illness may seem charming, but they are likely to be irritable and aggressive as well as irresponsible.\" Clearly, the disorder can be really difficult for all involved.\n\n\n\n5. They Always Complain About Feeling Empty\n\nBorderline personality disorder is pretty well-known, as far as the disorders go. A person with the disorder may complain about lacking a \"sense of self,\" and as a result may have feelings of emptiness or fear of abandonment, according to Burton. People with BPD also tend to show signs of unstable relationships, emotional instability, outbursts of anger and violence, and impulsive behavior. They also may threaten or attempt suicide or self-harm, so it's incredibly important to seek help for them immediately when or if that happens.\n\n\n\n6. They Have To Be The Center Of Attention\n\nEveryone has that one friend who has to be in the center of attention, and it can be kind of charming. But if his or her attention-seeking behavior constantly pours over into dramatics, it could be a sign of histrionic personality disorder, according to the Mayo Clinic. Other signs include being excessively emotional, dramatic, or sexually provocative to gain attention; speaking dramatically with strong opinions, but few facts to back them up; being easily influenced by others; shallow, rapidly changing emotions; thinking friends are closer to them than they really are; and excessive concern with physical appearance. It can be exhausting, but remember it's not their fault.\n\n\n\n7. They Are Obsessed With Themselves\n\nIn the same vein as above is narcissistic personality disorder. This disorder would describe that friend of yours who has a long-standing pattern of grandiosity, an overwhelming need for admiration, and a complete lack of empathy toward others, according to Steve Bressert, Ph.D., on PsychCentral.com. This person may also feel like they are the single most important person in everyone's lives.\n\n\n\n8. They Really Struggle With Rejection\n\nYou probably don't hang out with someone who really struggles with rejection. Because if they do, it may be they have avoidant personality disorder, and therefore struggle with maintaining relationships. \"Avoidant personality disorder is characterized by feelings of extreme social inhibition, inadequacy, and sensitivity to negative criticism and rejection ... Avoidant personality disorder causes significant problems that affect the ability to interact with others and maintain relationships in day-to-day life,\" noted an article on Webmd.com. So if you have a long-lost friend, or super shy uncle, this could be what's going on.\n\n\n\n9. They Are Very Rigid And Detail-Oriented\n\nYou might think it's cute that your roommate is orderly to a fault, but if he or she gets overly upset when something is out of order, it could be a sign of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. According to the Mayo Clinic, it's defined by a preoccupation with details, orderliness, and rules. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder symptoms also include extreme perfectionism, resulting in dysfunction and distress; a desire to control people; a neglect of friends and enjoyable activities because of a commitment to work or a project; and inflexibility about mortality, ethics, or values. Definitely not a charming or desirable problem to deal with.\n\n\n\n10. They Are Super Clingy\n\nAgain, this one may seem sweet to being with. But keep an eye on people who are overly clingy, to the point of desperation, as it could be dependent personality disorder (DPD). As noted in an article on WebMD, \"People with DPD become emotionally dependent on other people and spend great effort trying to please others.\" They may also have difficulty making decisions, they may avoid adult responsibilities, be overly sensitive to criticism, fear abandonment, and hate spending time alone. It's truly a difficult feeling to live with.\n\n\n\n11. They Seem To Be Upset Or Overwhelmed\n\nRemember that everyone is eccentric, depressed, paranoid, and obsessive from time to time. The thing to keep in mind is that a true personality disorder will cause incredible distress. It can lead to work and relationship difficulties, as well as problems functioning in society. \"It impacts all areas of their lives, but typically can not be formally diagnosed until [age] 18, although there are early indicators,\" Martinez says.\n\n\n\nBe careful not to diagnose yourself or others. If you think someone you know has a personality disorder, see if they are interested in getting help. Personality disorders may be difficult to treat, but that doesn't mean it's a hopeless cause. A therapist can help manage symptoms, and offer up coping mechanisms, so you and your loved ones can have a healthier, happier relationship.\n\nImages: Pexels (12)\n\nHappy shopping!

Since the Centers for Disease Control estimates that 50 to 70 million U.S. adults suffer from sleep wakefulness disorder, it's clear that America is seriously sleep deprived. You might think that you're getting more than enough sleep to function, but it might be time to examine your own definition of \"function.\" Functioning isn't thriving, just as surviving isn't really living. The bare minimum is never the goal, and sleeping the shortest amount of time in order to get through the following day is no way to present your best self to the world.\n\nSometimes it can be hard to tell, though, if you truly are sleep deprived. Especially if you work hard, eat right, and sleep as much as you can given your insanely hectic lifestyle. You're doing the best you can, so what more can be done? However, your body is extremely trustworthy in letting you know what you need, so really, you just need to pay attention in order to find the answer. Listen up, and your bod will give it to you straight. Here are all the sneaky signs that you need more sleep, and should go take a nap immediately.\n\n1. You're in a state of constant crankiness\n\nWhen a baby gets fussy, it might be time for a nap. And apparently, humans never really grow out of that. A study from Harvard Medical School shows a connection between sleep disorders and emotional and mental health issues. The more tired you are, the more irritable you become. You become less equipped to handle stress. And that can lead to anxiety, depression, and other disorders down the road.\n\n2. You're always hungry\n\nNo matter how often you're feeding that hangry stomach of yours, it's never satisfied. You might find some charm and humor in that, in sort of a Liz Lemon-always-snacking kind of way. But, a study by NCBI found that lack of sleep leads to a decreased level of leptin (the hormone that inhibits hunger and regulates energy). So if you're constantly craving a snack, it could be because you're sleep deprived.\n\n3. You pass out as soon as your head hits the pillow\n\nIf putting your head down on a pillow is all it takes for you to dive into a deep sleep, then you need more sleep. According to the Institute of Neurological Sleep Disorders and Stroke, if you fall asleep within five minutes of lying down, you are probably suffering from severe sleep deprivation.\n\n4. You look hungover even when you're not\n\nThis is not a good look. Puffy, bloodshot eyes and a dull complexion are not always the direct result of too much booze the night before. This also occurs when you haven't gotten much sleep. Why do you think they call it \"beauty sleep?\"\n\n5. Your immune system sucks\n\nDear Immune System, You had one job \u2014 to keep the diseases away. WTF?\n\nIf you keep getting colds and always feel like garbage, lack of sleep might be to blame. Need proof? In one study, healthy people were injected with the cold virus. Those who had gotten less than seven hours of sleep each night the week before were three times more likely to develop cold symptoms compared to those who got eight hours or more. Oh the difference an hour makes.\n\n6. You're spacing out on the reg\n\nDaydreaming and taking imagination breaks during the workday is not the same as staring into a blurry void of nothing. One stimulates the brain, and one is a sign that you are lacking in cumulative Zs. And to those who think staying up late to complete a project is a good idea \u2014 sorry, but you are incorrect. You simply do not become more productive the longer you go without proper rest. So know when it's time to call it a day, and return to your work when you are fully rested.\n\n7. You ugly cry over every little thing\n\nHarvard Medical School also found that a good night's sleep promotes emotional resilience, while lack of sleep leads to emotional vulnerability. So outside of PMS, if random things are making you weep, it's time to evaluate your sleep habits.\n\n8. You can't fully wake up with the help of coffee\n\nCoffee is your savior, but what about when it doesn't seem to save you at all? If you're still tired throughout the day and have trouble waking up after your routine cup of joe, then you didn't snooze long enough the night before.\n\n9. Your sex drive is MIA\n\nIt's hard to get into sexytimes with your partner when the moment you lie down, you're out like a light. And in a study by NCBI, sleep deprivation has been linked to lowered sex drive. So, go to bed so you can become once again interested in sex. Because what is life without it?\n\n10. You doze at the end of yoga or in the movie theater\n\nIf it's still daytime and you're on the verge of snoozing when placed in a dark room or environment, your body is telling you to catch more Zs. So it's time to listen!\n\n11. You're clumsier than J.Law\n\nClumsiness brings a certain level of charm to someone's persona, but it could also be a signal that you need more rest. Your motor skills take a dive when you're sleepy. And a 1997 study even found that a person who has gone a night without sleep is as lacking in hand-eye coordination in the morning as someone who is considered legally drunk. Now imagine that same person driving to work. Yikes.\n\n12. Your skin is a war zone of blemishes\n\nOh yeah, acne arrives in full force when you're overtired. So that's fun. Especially when you're in your 30s and should be past your pimple prime. Your skin works to repair itself throughout the night and when it's deprived of that time, your hormones spike and your skin's collagen breaks down, according to an NCBI study.\n\n13. You're suddenly a night owl\n\nYour body wants you to get into a healthy routine, so when you're running on not much sleep, it tries to regulate itself by providing a surge of energy at the worst possible time \u2014 right before bed, according to Dr. Rafael Pelayo of Stanford University Sleep Medicine Center.\n\nMoral of the story? Go to bed. Now.\n\nImage: Fotolia; Giphy (13)", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/136106-13-signs-you-are-sleep-deprived-and-need-a-nap-immediately", "summary": "Depending on how much sleep you're currently getting, your body may be sending you sneaky signs that you're sleep deprived.\nSince the Centers for Disease Control estimates that 50 to 70 million U.S. adults suffer from sleep wakefulness disorder, it's clear that America is seriously sleep deprived.\nSometimes it can be hard to tell, though, if you truly are sleep deprived.\nHere are all the sneaky signs that you need more sleep, and should go take a nap immediately.\nSo if you're constantly craving a snack, it could be because you're sleep deprived.", "timescraped": 1513838473.5022469, "category": {"words": 1094, "personal": 0, "thirdperson": 1, "condition": 1, "recovery": 1}}, "161e174818b4c05b2e81f206d959c818": {"title": "5 Mental Health Disorders That Are Often Misdiagnosed", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost%2F2016%2F9%2F13%2Fb5055167-e24c-489b-8bd0-b0eac309246e.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "text": "A lot of people (including me) sometimes make it sound like finding the courage to go to a doctor to talk about your mental health problems and get a diagnosis is the final big step in getting a handle on your mental health. But sometimes, getting into that doctor's office is not the end of the road, but the beginning of the second leg of your journey \u2014 because sometimes, getting a correct mental health diagnosis takes a few tries. Though there aren't many hard statistics available on how many people get incorrect initial diagnoses when they seek mental health assistance, it definitely happens \u2014 especially with certain specific mental health disorders (like bipolar disorder) which have some symptoms in common with other disorders, but must be treated with different kinds of therapy or medication.\n\nMisdiagnosis can happen with any mental health disorder, though \u2014 for instance, a 2012 article in Current Psychiatry quoted studies that found that \"26% to 45% of patients referred for \u2018depression\u2019 did not meet diagnostic criteria for a depressive illness.\" Similarly, a 2009 meta-analysis of 50,000 patients published in The Lancet found that general practitioners only correctly identified depression in patients in 47.3 percent of cases, with many doctors diagnosing depression in patients who did not actually suffer from it. And some cultural groups tend to be misdiagnosed more often that others \u2014 according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, \"research studies have shown lack of cultural competence in mental health care [which] results in misdiagnosis and inadequate treatment. African Americans and other multicultural communities tend to receive poorer quality of care.\" And while an accurate diagnosis can be the first step in getting healthy, a misdiagnosis can set us back, and cause a lot of unnecessary suffering.\n\nA misdiagnosis is different, of course, from an accurate diagnosis that you just aren't ready to hear right now. I am an personally a lay expert in this field \u2014 I was initially tentatively diagnosed with ADHD as a teenager, but basically refused to hear it until my late twenties. But sometimes, because of our own research or simply due to the experience of living in our own bodies and minds, we have a feeling that an initial diagnosis is wrong. If you experience this, you shouldn't be afraid to look for a second opinion, or a doctor who takes your own personal experiences of your symptoms seriously. Getting mental health help can be absolutely life-changing \u2014 but only if you're getting the right treatment for the right actual issue.\n\nRead on for five of the most commonly misdiagnosed mental health disorders.\n\n1. Bipolar Disorder\n\nFrequently Misdiagnosed As: unipolar depression, ADHD.\n\n\n\nA 2006 study published in Psychiatry reported that \"69 percent of patients with bipolar disorder are misdiagnosed initially and more than one-third remained misdiagnosed for 10 years or more.\" The same study cited another study which found the average amount of time it took for people with bipolar disorder to get a correct diagnosis ranged from five to seven years.\n\nPeople with bipolar disorder typically first seek treatment while having a depressive episode, which often leads to the disorder being misdiagnosed as depression (unipolar depression); conversely, people with bipolar disorder who are currently dealing with a manic episode may have their symptoms, such as restlessness and insomnia, misdiagnosed as ADHD. Diagnosis can also be difficult for people who are experiencing bipolar disorder but whose presentation of symptoms looks slightly different from the standard diagnostic criteria on issues such as duration of hypomanic states.\n\nMisdiagnoses can be especially dangerous here, because getting the incorrect treatment can actually worse the problem \u2014 for example, antidepressants used to treat unipolar depression can sometimes make people with bipolar disorder feel worse.\n\n2. Borderline Personality Disorder\n\nFrequently Misdiagnosed As: bipolar disorder, PTSD, unipolar depression.\n\n\n\nBPD is a complex disorder that has symptoms similar to many other mental health disorders \u2014 and many mental health professionals have not had a lot of exposure or education on BPD, so it's easy for them to mistake it for something else. Symptoms like impulsive behavior or mood swings may be misread as signs of ADHD or bipolar disorder, according to the UK's MInd.org, while issues like feelings of disconnect from others can be misread as PTSD or depression. BPD is very commonly mistaken for bipolar disorder, because both disorders involve shifting moods and periods of depression.\n\nAgain, you absolutely can struggle with both BPD and PTSD, or BPD and anxiety \u2014 but it's important for doctor's to understand the full picture in order to help you receive the correct treatment. BPD treatment usually involves very specific kinds of therapy, rather than a specific medication, so a correct diagnosis is incredibly important in making sure that you get the correct kind of assistance.\n\n3. ADHD\n\nFrequently Misdiagnosed As: anxiety, OCD, depression, bipolar disorder.\n\n\n\nThough many studies point to the fact that ADHD itself is often diagnosed in people who don't suffer from it \u2014 according to a Michigan State University study, primarily among children who are simply having age-related difficulties focusing or acting maturely \u2014 in adults, it often goes the other way around: because so many people (including some mental health professionals) don't think of ADHD as a disorder that impacts adults, many ADHD symptoms (like racing thoughts or mood swings) are misdiagnosed for another common mental illness.\n\nThis also goes for symptoms that are the result of living life without proper ADHD treatment \u2014 for instance, social anxiety that has developed from a lifetime of having trouble with social interactions due to ADHD-related issues can be misread as simply being a product of generalized anxiety disorder; similarly, low self-esteem and stress due to ADHD can be misread as depressive disorder.\n\nNot to say you can't suffer from both anxiety and ADHD or ADHD and bipolar disorder, of course. But as ADDitude, a magazine for people coping with ADD/ADHD, notes, \"Many of the less-known symptoms of ADHD \u2014 working memory and executive function deficits, difficulty sleeping, and irritability, for example \u2014 also show up with depression, autism, anxiety, and other brain-based conditions,\" leading doctors to have trouble properly diagnosing ADHD. And women in particular often have a hard time getting diagnosed for ADHD.\n\n4. Post-traumatic Stress Disorder\n\nFrequently Misdiagnosed As: depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder.\n\n\n\nPTSD is, according to the American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy, \"a psychiatric diagnosis for people who have endured a highly stressful and frightening experience and who are experiencing distress caused by memories of that experience.\" But while PTSD is a unique mental health issue, many of its symptoms \u2014 like anxiety, emotional numbness, risky behavior, intensely fearful and risk-averse behavior, and inability to sleep \u2014 can make it seem as if the patient is struggling with a different mental health problem. This is especially true if the doctor examining the patient doesn't have any experience treating PTSD.\n\nIn fact, incorrect diagnoses for people grappling with PTSD are tragically common. According to an NBC News report, between 2005 and 2007, the Army dismissed roughly 1,000 soldiers each year because a psychological evaluation found that they had a personality disorder (a status which left them ineligible for military health care and other benefits); a change to policy in 2008 that required a top-level review to rule out PTSD as a cause in every personality disorder dismissal caused that number to drop to roughly 260 a year. And according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, \"African American men are more likely to receive a misdiagnosis of schizophrenia, when expressing symptoms related to mood disorders or PTSD.\"\n\nBecause it is unique, and because every patient needs a different treatment, it's also key that PTSD is treated by a mental health professional who is knowledgeable about the disorder, rather than by a doctor who only has a background in treating more common mental health problems.\n\n5. Anxiety\n\nFrequently Misdiagnosed As: depression, nothing.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, \"Anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the U.S.,\" impacting 18 percent of Americans. However, despite this, it can take people struggling with anxiety disorders an incredibly long amount of time to be properly diagnosed \u2014 according to Robert Leahy, Ph.D., a clinical professor of psychology and psychiatry at Weill Cornell Medical College, speaking to Glamour, \"The average length of time between the onset of symptoms\u2014the time a woman starts feeling bad\u2014and when she gets actual diagnosis is between nine and 12 years.\"\n\nMany people don't understand that their anxiety symptoms indicate a mental health problem \u2014 they just think of them as \"part of life,\" and thus simply don't think to see a doctor. But even when people with anxiety see a doctor for diagnosis, they aren't guaranteed a correct diagnosis \u2014 some anxiety symptoms, like sleep issues and inability to concentrate, can also be signs of depression, leading doctors to make the wrong call.\n\nWhat Can You Do If You Think You've Been Misdiagnosed?\n\nResearching and seeking out a doctor when you're suffering from a mental health problem can be grueling, and the process of finding and researching a new psychiatrist or therapist after you've already found can feel overwhelming. But if you think you're not getting the proper treatment, or feel that you would work better with a different mental health professional, you owe it to yourself to get a second opinion.\n\nIf you need help finding another doctor or therapist, you can call the mental health hotline tied to your insurance plan to find doctors in your area covered by your plan; you can also consult an online resource of mental health professionals, like Psychology Today's therapist locator, or a counselor directory on a site like Good Therapy. No matter what, try to not get discouraged, and not give up \u2014 getting an accurate diagnosis is worth it.\n\nImages: Pexels; Giphy", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/165839-5-mental-health-disorders-that-are-often-misdiagnosed", "summary": "A lot of people (including me) sometimes make it sound like finding the courage to go to a doctor to talk about your mental health problems and get a diagnosis is the final big step in getting a handle on your mental health.\nThough there aren't many hard statistics available on how many people get incorrect initial diagnoses when they seek mental health assistance, it definitely happens \u2014 especially with certain specific mental health disorders (like bipolar disorder) which have some symptoms in common with other disorders, but must be treated with different kinds of therapy or medication.\nGetting mental health help can be absolutely life-changing \u2014 but only if you're getting the right treatment for the right actual issue.\nRead on for five of the most commonly misdiagnosed mental health disorders.\nBPD is a complex disorder that has symptoms similar to many other mental health disorders \u2014 and many mental health professionals have not had a lot of exposure or education on BPD, so it's easy for them to mistake it for something else.", "timescraped": 1513838452.661273, "category": {"words": 1642, "personal": 6, "thirdperson": 10, "condition": 39, "recovery": 0}}, "7b96ff340523cd5d446d8abadaa51717": {"title": "11 Things People With Anxiety Want You To Understand", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost%2F2016%2F11%2F10%2F81ea8a0e-8f61-42fa-b798-94453e98adf8.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "text": "Mental illnesses like general anxiety disorder (GAD) don't discriminate, no matter what your race, background, or socioeconomic status is. That said, women are 60 percent more likely than men to have an anxiety disorder, so chances are, you or someone close to you is dealing with it. It could be anyone \u2014 even that gorgeous, friendly woman you sometimes commute to work with. When it comes the \"type\" of person wrestling with this illness, don't get sucked into what the media portrays \u2014 there isn't one type.\n\nPeople with anxiety disorders are struggling behind closed doors more than they are in public, and just because they seem put together when you meet them for weeknight cocktails doesn't mean they've got it all figured out. Having suffered from acute anxiety \u2014 it was tied up with my binge eating disorder (BED) \u2014 since I was a teenager, I have learned a few things about getting people to understand the struggles I go through. The best gifts I ever received from friends were space and understanding. The more you hover over somebody with anxiety, the quicker you will push them away, the faster you will make them feel like they're abnormal.\n\nThe assistance we do need isn't always what you think it is though, like taking us to the doctor. We might just need a pair of ears to hear us out \u2014 or some alone time. The most important thing is to love us unconditionally and never make assumptions about our condition.\n\nHere are 11 things people with anxiety want you to know.\n\n1. Social Gatherings Are Hard\n\n[Embed]\n\nParties are no fun. Neither are baby showers. We would rather watch paint dry than go to a big wedding where everyone is dolled up \u2014 and chatty. With anxiety disorders comes stress in large social situations, particularly when it's an event where everybody is smiling and celebrating a happy life event. If we turn down an invite, it's not because we don't love you \u2014 the party might just be genuinely overwhelming to us.\n\n\n\n2. Sometimes We Just Don't Feel Like Laughing\n\n[Embed]\n\nPeople who see us on edge automatically assume that the best thing to do is tell a joke, or do something silly to make us smile.\n\nThere's a difference between forcing us into laughter and lightening the mood; the former always comes off as inauthentic \u2014 because it usually is \u2014 while the latter can be done naturally, without making us feel like we're being treated in a loony bin. Don't force us to laugh, please.\n\n\n\n3. This Doesn't Define Us\n\n[Embed]\n\nPlease don't whisper about us behind our backs and label us according to what kind of anxiety disorder we harbor (I swear, I was once dubbed Nervous Nancy). This disease doesn't make up our entire identity; that's a fact we lose sight of at times, which just makes us feel worse about ourselves, so try to steer clear of insensitive comments and nicknames. Instead, remind us of all the reasons we are wonderful \u2014 no harm can come out of that.\n\n\n\n4. Things That Don't Affect You Bother Us\n\n[Embed]\n\nI'm talking about those little, tiny, minute occurrences that you probably don't even give a second thought to, like having you come over to our apartment for the very first time. Our brains are wired differently, and we might even be dealing with some chemical imbalances, so those small things make our minds run wild while you can merely shrug them off and continue on with your life. If we seem a little nervous, please don't make fun of us, or make us feel guilty.\n\n\n\n5. We're Physically Exhausted\n\n[Embed]\n\nIn case you haven't heard, the mind and body are intricately connected, so if one is facing difficulties, the other will visibly suffer. People with anxiety disorders tend to live in a hyper-tense state, especially when they're not getting the treatment they need. This causes the heart rate and blood pressure to rise, and our digestive system might not be working properly. Be gentle with us if you see that we're tired and cranky, because we probably didn't sleep at all last night.\n\n\n\n6. We'd Appreciate The Space To Vent\n\nIt's hard to find a good enough friend or family member out there who can listen to our troubles without passing any judgment whatsoever. If you could be that person for us, we'd love you forever. The more we bottle stuff up, the more likely we are to have a panic attack or end up locked up in our bedroom, surrounded by Ben & Jerry's. Plus, nothing is worse than being honest, only to see the person across from us with a disgusted look on their face. Try not to be supportive and non-judgmental \u2014 and remember, you don't have to fix it.\n\n7. We're Trying Our Hardest\n\nJust because you don't see us running to a therapy session every Wednesday doesn't mean we're not doing our absolute best to work on this mental illness. It's really, really hard being trapped in this head constantly and not fully understanding all the emotional phases that pass by. Please don't assume that we aren't aware of our troubles. We. So. Are. And we're doing our best to heal ourselves, in our own ways.\n\n\n\n8. We Appreciate You\n\n[Embed]\n\nYeah, it's hard to say out loud, but we love all the support and encouragement you give us. We might not show it, and that's only because we get so caught up in trying to make sense of the chaotic, demanding world around us. So, thanks for late-night chats and the text messages that are meant to bring us out of hiding on a weekend night. We're trying to get better at saying thank you more often.\n\n\n\n9. We'll Never Be Just Like You\n\nThere might be a \"normal\" mold out there that you and many other people fit into \u2014 and we may never be granted citizenship on that land. There's nothing wrong with that, so don't make us feel like there is. We might never be interested in Halloween parties or Saturday morning yoga classes, no matter how rad you think they are. Let us be our own people, and, I promise, we'll have a much better shot at getting along.\n\n\n\n10. We Don't All Need Medication\n\n[Embed]\n\nIt far too common: people struggling with a mental illness are told that we should think about a certain kind of medication. But what works for your younger, manic depressive cousin may not necessarily work for us. Some respond well to anti-anxiety prescriptions, while it exacerbates the symptoms of others. Instead of telling us we need to take pills, ask us openly if we've ever considered it. We'll tell you where we stand.\n\n\n\n11. You May Never Know The Whole Story\n\nCountless parts of illnesses like GAD are suffered behind closed doors. We don't like being the center of attention, so we do everything we can to hide all the awful things we're going through; this could mean that we aren't going to tell you everything when you ask us to share our personal stories. Don't take it personally \u2014 we're either not ready yet to reveal corners of ourselves, or we've decided that there are some things we'd prefer to keep private.\n\n\n\nImages: Drew Herron/Flickr; Giphy (11)", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/114084-11-things-people-with-anxiety-want-you-to-understand", "summary": "Mental illnesses like general anxiety disorder (GAD) don't discriminate, no matter what your race, background, or socioeconomic status is.\nThat said, women are 60 percent more likely than men to have an anxiety disorder, so chances are, you or someone close to you is dealing with it.\nHaving suffered from acute anxiety \u2014 it was tied up with my binge eating disorder (BED) \u2014 since I was a teenager, I have learned a few things about getting people to understand the struggles I go through.\nHere are 11 things people with anxiety want you to know.\nIf we turn down an invite, it's not because we don't love you \u2014 the party might just be genuinely overwhelming to us.", "timescraped": 1513838453.9440799, "category": {"words": 1251, "personal": 90, "thirdperson": 12, "condition": 11, "recovery": 0}}, "dc0ffff3765dac759ccab9219f81116c": {"title": "13 Weird Thoughts People With Anxiety Have", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost%2F2016%2F9%2F13%2Fe7966c6b-f4c0-4b40-a9bd-cf92db4915fb.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "text": "I'm not trying to say that we are members of an exclusive club or anything like that, but people with anxiety experience life differently. On a very basic level, we don't see the world the same way as those who have never dealt with an anxiety disorder; we have a different kind of brain. We turn the simplest things into mini-explosions of stress, and we worry about stuff that wouldn't even make a non-anxious person think twice. Robert L. Leahy, Ph.D., the Associate Editor of the International Journal of Cognitive Therapy and author of over 20 books on mental illness, wrote for Psychology Today about the \"intrusive thoughts\" people with anxiety deal with. He says it can feel like you're battling your own mind at times, and that we anxiety sufferers can be plagued by the most bizarre notions. However, treatments like cognitive therapy can be useful tools in separating the thoughts from reality.\n\nIn order to raise awareness about what people with mental illness go through on a daily basis, Huffington Post gathered and shared anonymous thoughts from editors and readers who struggle with anxiety. It was an honest look into the brains of people who can feel constantly misunderstood. For example, one person said they often think, \"Are they laughing at me? I hope I don\u2019t mess this up. Was that supposed to be funny? Was I NOT supposed to laugh? Can I leave yet?\" As someone who has battled acute anxiety for years, I can't help but laugh a little bit at this, because it's pretty much the exact transcript to the thoughts that run through my mind a lot of the times. Hey, if I have to deal with it anyway, I might as well find some humor in it.\n\nHere are 13 weird thoughts people with anxiety have.\n\n1. \"Maybe Gmail Was Lying And That Email Didn't Actually Send\"\n\n[Embed]\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matter how many times you double-check whether you finished an important task, like sending out a big email or locking your front door, it's never enough. You still wonder whether it actually got done, even after you've received confirmation from a reliable source that it's been completed.\n\n\n\n2. \"What Does My Face Really Look Like?\"\n\n[Embed]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFolks with anxiety tend to fall into deep philosophical thought about, well, pretty much everything. We may especially struggle with thoughts about physical appearance because we know what we see in the mirror is not necessarily what others see when they look (or stare) at us. So it isn't uncommon for us to turn over this thought again and again in our heads, wondering how much of the time we look the way we do in photos, and how often we actually resemble a stressed-out alien.\n\n3. \"She's Mad At Me Because I Took Too Long To Text Back, I Just Know It\"\n\n[Embed]\n\n\n\n\n\nWe're always worried about whether somebody close to us is mad at us for some dumb reason. If my best friend and I are messaging back and forth and she suddenly doesn't respond, I automatically assume that I waited too long to respond, and as a result she is going to end all our years of friendship to trade me in for someone who can type a reply at a more acceptable pace.\n\n\n\n4. \"What If My Neighbors Can Hear What I Watch On Netflix?\"\n\n[Embed]\n\nFor someone with anxiety, everything can be embarrassing. It could be the sound of your shoes walking on the sidewalk or what you look like when you bite into a sandwich. One thing we often get really sensitive about is our choice in television shows. What if people find out how much Real Housewives we watch? Can the neighbors hear, and are they totally judging us for it? And so on.\n\n5. \"Did That Mole Change Shape??\"\n\n[Embed]\n\n\n\n\n\nAs soon as something on our body looks or feels odd, we get nervous about it . Our brains automatically go to the most ominous possibility, which is and always will be cancer. If we're really on a roll, we immediately hop onto one of the many websites that allow you to jump to horrifying conclusions about your health based on very common symptoms, where there are plenty of hokey medical diagnoses to keep us occupied through the night.\n\n6. \"The Whole Office Hates Me Because Of How I Sneeze\"\n\n[Embed]\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial settings aren't exactly where most people with anxiety thrive. I generally think anyone who claims they like hanging out in a large group of people is just lying through their teeth, but when you have anxiety, these situations can be a special kind of torture. You tend to overanalyze everything you do in social settings, especially in the office. It's a given to speculate about how much your coworkers despise you , but the real fun begins when you start to comb through all the specific reasons they might hate you. Usually, you'll settle on the smallest things, like how high-pitched your sneeze is or how many times you go in and out of the break room in a day.\n\n7. \"Did I Leave Out Something In The Apartment That The Cat Could Eat And Die From?\"\n\n[Embed]\n\nAnxiety disorders can cause the most innocent of people to produce gory visuals in their heads. Don't beat yourself up about it if you think about death every now and again. It's totally normal! Death happens! But you don't want it to happen to your cat, which is why you think about it every hour on the hour.\n\n8. \"Is There Such Thing As Donut Breath?\"\n\n[Embed]\n\nIf it paid well enough, worrying about personal hygiene could be a lucrative career for anxiety sufferers. We're always concerned with how we smell. No matter how much deodorant we slather on in the morning, we still fret about weird armpit scents. Along with the normal body odors, though, we invent new, specific smells to worry about. Because a box of donuts must have some kind of consequences, right?\n\n9. \"My Boss Called But Didn't Leave A Voicemail, So I Must Be Fired\"\n\n[Embed]\n\n\n\n\n\nThinking about the worst case scenario is second nature to us. All it takes is the tiniest bump in the road to make us presume the most grim outcome. I have this thought pretty much every time my boss doesn't respond right away. And if my editor writes her notes into my articles in all-caps? She hates me, for sure, according to my anxiety.\n\n\n\n10. \"I'm Taking Way Too Long To Tell This Story, Aren't I?\"\n\n[Embed]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe general rules of social etiquette often go way over the heads of most folks with anxiety. And not understanding those rules makes us feel a little freaked out. We get distressed about group conversations and being judged for the words that come out of our mouths. We can be particularly harsh on ourselves when it comes to storytelling. We worry about how boring we are and whether we're totally ruining everyone's time together.\n\n11. \"Do I Get Up To Pee Too Often?\"\n\n[Embed]\n\n\n\n\n\nEveryone is watching you. At least, that's what it feels like. Plus, your chair squeaks really loud every time you get up to go to the bathroom. You make it to the stall nearly drenched in sweat from all the worrying and spend the rest of the day tallying how many times you pee.\n\n\n\n12. \"Nobody Liked My Tweet, So I May As Well Delete My Twitter Account!\"\n\n[Embed]\n\nA question I ask myself each day: Nobody thinks I'm funny, so why even bother to exist online? Not being acknowledged for a joke you just cracked can really eat away at you when you've got an anxiety disorder. Humor is one of the hardest parts of social interaction, especially because there are so many unspoken rules you have to follow. It gets so overwhelming that it sometimes feels like it might be better to just throw in the towel.\n\n13. \"I'm So Anxious I Give Everyone Else Anxiety\"\n\n[Embed]\n\n\n\n\n\nget anxious about how anxious I am , and then I lose sleep thinking about how much my anxiety gives other people anxiety. Is my anxiety contagious? Am I passing it on to innocent bystanders and ruining their lives? I'm sure this is not an abnormal thought for us anxious folk. I hope it's not, anyway.\n\nImages: HBO; Giphy (13)", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/156991-13-weird-thoughts-people-with-anxiety-have", "summary": "I'm not trying to say that we are members of an exclusive club or anything like that, but people with anxiety experience life differently.\nHere are 13 weird thoughts people with anxiety have.\n\"What Does My Face Really Look Like?\"\nNot being acknowledged for a joke you just cracked can really eat away at you when you've got an anxiety disorder.\n\"I'm So Anxious I Give Everyone Else Anxiety\"[Embed]get anxious about how anxious I am , and then I lose sleep thinking about how much my anxiety gives other people anxiety.", "timescraped": 1513838455.378677, "category": {"words": 1393, "personal": 73, "thirdperson": 14, "condition": 18, "recovery": 0}}, "ed1f07cce44b7ef9115b91e112e4c599": {"title": "7 Self-Care Ideas For During The Holidays That Will Help Ease Depression & Anxiety", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/uploads/image/2017/12/10/b0358747-fce8-45ef-8e29-5422fc5e74bf-zaeh_bustle_aug2015-62.jpg?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "text": "When you're already struggling with anxiety and depression, the holidays are especially difficult. If you're in this club that no one chooses to be a member of, you're going to want to try these self-care ideas for the 2017 holidays to help ease anxiety and depression. As we approach the one-year anniversary of actor and mental-health activist Carrie Fisher's death, one quote from her autobiographical novel Postcards From The Edge comes to mind. Fisher wrote: \"It's like I've got a visa for happiness, but for sadness I've got a lifetime pass.\"\n\nWhile it might feel like anxiety and depression has you in a vice grip this holiday season, taking time for self care can ease the burden. As a fellow lifetime warrior in the battle against depression, I know that the pressure to be merry and bright, shop for gifts, and attend endless holiday gatherings when you'd rather pull the covers over your head can be overwhelming. This is why it's especially important to take care of your mental health during the holidays when the most wonderful time of the year can feel anything but.\n\n\"The term 'Happy Holidays' is a top sentiment throughout the months of November and December, but the phrase doesn't necessarily ring true for everyone,\" Dr. Bal Nandra, Chicago-based Chief Medical Officer of IV Solutions, said in a press release sent to Bustle. \"Family stressors, issues with money, unrealistic expectations, and a full social calendar can be overwhelming for most, but for those suffering already from depression, the holidays can take a real toll.\"\n\nThe struggle is real, and if you're looking for some ways to relieve the pressure, these self-care ideas can help you get through the 2017 holidays in one piece.\n\n1. Plan Ahead For Self-Care\n\nPersonally, a big part of my depression is feeling guilty for being depressed in the first place. Psych Central reported that a study has shown that the brains of people with depression respond differently to feelings of guilt, and people who are depressed tend to feel guilty about things that other people don't. The pressure to enjoy the holidays, and the guilt over not actually enjoying yourself, can cause you to put others' needs above your own, attend events you don't feel mentally strong enough to handle, and neglect your emotional health.\n\nDr. Nandra noted that this is why it's important to plan ahead for self-care during the holidays. Because, if you don't build in the time to care for yourself, you might end up feeling even more depressed and anxious. Singer/songwriter Kesha is also a fellow depression warrior, and she recently penned an essay for TIME about the struggle of navigating the holidays while depressed. \"Around the holidays, I often feel like I\u2019m supposed to be everywhere, with everyone \u2014 all with the added guilt that it\u2019s the season of giving. To fight this, I\u2019ve developed a mantra: It\u2019s not selfish to take time for yourself.\"\n\nSelf-care looks different for everyone, so choose something that you know will make you feel good. While I was going through a particularly bad stretch of depression during the 2016 holidays I watched Gilmore Girls every single day, and it helped me feel a little bit better. \"Set aside time for yourself every day, even if it\u2019s just half an hour, where you can enjoy a relaxing activity like yoga, reading, taking an art class, bubble bath, etc.,\" Dr. David Greuner, Surgical Director at NYC Surgical Associates tells Bustle.\n\n2. Set Realistic Expectations\n\nOne way to avoid the guilt spiral that can occur during the 2017 holidays is to set realistic expectations for yourself. If your depression and anxiety has been making everyday activities difficult, then suddenly becoming the belle of the holiday social ball is probably going to be overwhelming. A recent survey conducted by Research Now on behalf of Fiber One noted that 74 percent of women admit they put others' needs ahead of their own, so it's important to know that you're not alone. However, when you're battling depression and anxiety you really need to put yourself first.\n\n\"It\u2019s not your responsibility to try to make the whole world happy,\" Kesha wrote for TIME. \"Especially since sometimes it\u2019s not that easy to make yourself happy, either \u2014 even with all the celebrations and gifts and seasonal decorations, foods and drinks, which can only do so much. So don\u2019t ask yourself things like 'It\u2019s almost Christmas, why am I not happy?' That can turn into a shame cycle. It\u2019s just another day \u2014 don\u2019t put unrealistic expectations on it, and don\u2019t beat yourself up.\"\n\n3. It's OK To Say \"No\"\n\nIf you suffer from anxiety or depression, then you know that saying \"no\" is often difficult because you don't want to disappoint others, and you may feel like declining an invitation will let people down. When you're depressed you might even feel more pressured to say \"yes\" if you're operating under the notion that your depression is already letting others down. While this is the guilt story your brain tells you, you don't have to listen to it. Rewrite the narrative, and put yourself first.\n\n\"Many of us are afraid of conflict. We don\u2019t like others to be angry with us or critical of us,\" F. Diane Barth L.C.S.W. explained on Psychology Today. \"We therefore avoid saying 'no' when we are afraid that it will put us into conflict with someone else, whether that someone is an intimate partner, a colleague or friend, or a supervisor or boss.\"\n\nIf your family holiday gatherings, or work office party, regularly devolves into a dark and twisty nightmare, and you feel like attending will make you even more anxious and depressed than you already are, you don't have to go. \"If an event has caused stress in the past, it will likely continue to do so,\" Dr. Nandra said. \"Learn to say no.\"\n\n4. Check In With Your Support System\n\nWith all the pressure to spread holiday cheer, for people suffering from anxiety or depression the urge to isolate can be strong. However Dr. John Mayer, clinical psychologist at Doctor On Demand, tells Bustle that this is when you should reach out to your support system. \"The holidays make us even busier than usual, take time to see your therapist.\"\n\nIf you don't have a support system, you can see a therapist on the Doctor On Demand app without ever leaving your home. While you might be tempted to go it alone, Dr. Nandra said it's important to \"acknowledge your feelings and reach out to others for reassurance and support.\" Additionally, these mental health apps can connect you with self-care techniques, therapists, and peers going through the same things as you, which could help you feel more calm.\n\n\"Talk to a friend you trust or a therapist,\" Kesha suggested in TIME. \"Sit out one of the holiday gatherings in favor of some personal time. Just do whatever helps you calm down and gives you a break from the stress. Download one of the many meditation apps for your phone. I particularly like 'Calm' and 'End Anxiety.'\"\n\n5. Get Enough Sleep\n\nAny disruption to your regular routine can cause anxiety or depression to worsen, and neglecting your sleep can be a big trigger. \"Make sure you get plenty of sleep, at least eight hours every night,\" Dr. Greuner tells Bustle. \"The holidays may mean late nights and early mornings, but try to arrange your schedule so you get enough sleep every night, which will help you manage stress levels as well as keep you healthy.\"\n\nPersonally, when I don't get enough sleep I feel anxious AF, and I almost always end up crying over something silly, like the drug store being out of my favorite toner. According to WebMD, \"Having a sleep disorder does not in itself cause depression, but lack of sleep does play a role. Lack of sleep caused by another medical illness or by personal problems can make depression worse.\"\n\n6. Maintain Your Healthy Habits\n\nThe holidays are generally a time of overindulgence for everyone. And, if you're dealing with depression and anxiety, you might be tempted to ditch your self-care habits in favor of self-soothing with too much [insert your vice here]. \"People tend to abandon healthy habits during the holidays which can weaken the immune system and be another reason why people are more likely to get sick,\" Dr. Greuner tells Bustle.\n\nAdditionally, stress can weaken your immune system and cause you to get sick, which is the last thing you need while trying to manage anxiety and depression. \"When you\u2019re over stressed your body creates excess cortisol, a stress hormone which can prevent your immune system from functioning properly, which is why it\u2019s important to find ways to manage stress,\" Dr. Greuner says.\n\nIf your regular yoga or meditation habit is making you feel better, it's especially important to maintain that routine during times of stress. Seriously, after a month of meditating everyday, I skipped a few days when I was feeling stressed on a work trip, and my anxiety returned full force. I was crying over things like making a wrong turn and not understanding directions to put together a piece of furniture. \"Continue to exercise and eat healthy throughout the holidays,\" Dr. Nandra advised. \"Don\u2019t abandon positive habits.\"\n\n7. Give Yourself A Break\n\nI don't know who decided that the holidays are when you're supposed to more things in one months than you do all year, but I'd really like to have a talk with that person.

Growing up, I was often told that mental illness was a white man\u2019s disease, so when I first began to struggle with anxiety and depression, I felt like an outlier, an oddball, like something was wrong with only me\u2026 like I wasn\u2019t wired how I was supposed to be. Books \u2014 in particular Yoruba Girl Dancing by Simi Bedford, about an African girl\u2019s education in England and the microaggressions she encounters, and At Her Majesty\u2019s Request by Walter Dean Myers, a nonfiction account of an African princess in Victorian England \u2014 comforted me, gave me language to discuss my struggles with my family, and ultimately, gave me the courage to continue living and seek help.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, one in five adults experience mental illness in a year. Given those numbers, it seems pretty much impossible that mental illness is only a white man\u2019s disease. Yet, the language passed down to me reinforced the narrative told in music, movies, and books: that mental illness is something white people, not people or color or Native people, experience.\n\nAs a writer and an editor and someone deeply committed to diversity in children\u2019s literature, I\u2019m always thinking about the long-term effects of not seeing yourself reflected in books. And when I talk about diversity in children\u2019s literature, I often talk about mirrors and windows \u2014 terms first used by Rudine Sims Bishop. \u201cWindows\u201d are books that allow the reader a glimpse into other life experiences, and \u201cmirrors\u201d are books in which readers can see their own experience reflected. I had so few mirror growing up. And, even when books have mirrored one part of my identity, they left out other parts of it.\n\nSo, in honor of World Mental Health Day and the generations of women in my family who have struggled with mental health issues, I wanted to shine a light where it\u2019s so rarely shown: to women of color and Native women, in particular young adult (and crossover adult) authors who are queens in their own right, writing mirrors that deal with their experiences with mental illness. These 12 authors are creating books my younger self would\u2019ve adored \u2014 narratives that are showing teens today that it is possible to live and thrive with mental illnesses. Here's why they do it:\n\nBrandy Colbert \u201cI often write about mental health in my work because mental illness was never talked about when I was young. I was raised in the Midwest by two Southern black parents who grew up in farming families, and all I knew was a 'we\u2019re too tough for that' attitude. The idea being that Black Americans have been through so much as a people that we can\u2019t let something 'little' like mental health distract us \u2014 an attitude that\u2019s all too prevalent in the Black community as a whole. After I moved to Los Angeles, I slowly realized how damaging that mindset is, and began to seek out books and movies and TV that openly dealt with mental illness. And when I was twenty-eight, I finally went to therapy myself. It\u2019s important for kids \u2014 especially kids of color \u2014 to know that discussing mental health is nothing to be ashamed of.\u201d Brandy Colbert is the author of Pointe, Little & Lion, and the forthcoming Finding Yvonne.\n\nKate Hart \u201c'Ancestral trauma' is the idea that depredations committed against one generation affect many generations to come, usually used in reference to the horrors of Native boarding schools. That particular part of history doesn't apply to my family, but the general concept resonates since every single one of my hereditary lines runs through Oklahoma, formerly known as Indian Territory. After our tribal governments were forcibly disbanded, one of my lines kept our Chickasaw enrollment, but all abandoned any cultural connections to their heritage. I personally became further estranged due to feuds between various relatives, exacerbated by a long and mostly hidden family history of mental illness that includes institutionalizations, suicides, and shock treatments \u2014 and ties directly to my own diagnoses. My current manuscript delves into these twins issues, digging painfully into a history that both my family and society tried hard to bury. But if exposing these secrets to the light gives future generations a fighting chance at healing, it's worth it.\" Kate Hart is the author of After the Fall.\n\nHeidi Heilig \u201cI wrote my madness into my first novel, though not into my main character. Nix, from The Girl From Everywhere, is mixed race \u2014 half Chinese, half white, like me \u2014 but though she has her problems, she is very sane. Her father, not so much. He is bipolar, obsessive, addicted... and white. Readers write to me about him sometimes. Some of them hate him. I understand why, and I can accept it. He\u2019s a bit of a villain \u2014 and so, sometimes, am I. But I don\u2019t know if that criticism would be so easy to hear if I had put that part of me into my main character \u2014 if readers hated a young girl of color for having the same mood swings and wild emotions as he does. As I do. There is already too little compassion for girls like us.\u201d Heidi Heilig is the author of The Girl from Everywhere and The Ship Beyond Time.\n\nS. Jae-Jones \u201cI spent a long time trying to write around my mental illness instead of writing through it. I was first diagnosed with bipolar disorder back in high school, and for years, I told myself that I was more than my mental illness or separate from it. I\u2019m a crazy person, but I\u2019m not crazy, I would tell myself. But it wasn\u2019t until I wrote Wintersong that I understood that I am not just more than my moods; my mania and melancholy make up who I am and how I write. How I see the world. So instead of avoiding my bipolar disorder while writing, I purposefully left it there, letting my crazy seep into my protagonist\u2019s every thought, every feeling, and every word. It wasn\u2019t until I\u2019d faced my mental illness monster on the page that I understood the monster was me, and it was worthy.\u201d S. Jae-Jones is the author of the New York Times bestselling author of Wintersong and the forthcoming Shadowsong.\n\nStephanie Kuehn \u201cI\u2019m frequently asked if my training and work as a psychologist informs my writing. The answer, of course, is yes, although I am cautious in this way\u2014there\u2019s far more danger in assuming knowledge than not. However, I\u2019m rarely asked the inverse: Does my writing inform my clinical work? Again, the answer\u2019s yes. The characters I create are often struggling to understand themselves \u2014 navigating the friction between how they experience the world and the way that others see and treat them. When I revisit the books I\u2019ve written, I can recall the musings or thoughts that inspired me, but I also see myself in ways I wasn\u2019t previously aware of: my own adolescent grappling with isolation and existential despair; my experiences with depression and self-harm that I had no clinical frame of reference for. It\u2019s all there. Ultimately, I believe writing is reciprocity. The words we choose, the stories we tell \u2014 these aren\u2019t one-sided actions. They tell us something about ourselves. And in telling them, they change us.\u201d Stephanie Kuehn is the author of When I Am Through With You and other novels.\n\nSarah Kuhn \u201cIt\u2019s always been hard for me to admit to anything that might be perceived as 'weakness.' As a woman of color, I often feel pressure to appear unbreakable\u2014it took me a long time to admit my anxiety was very real and to seek help for it. When I wrote Evie Tanaka, the fire-wielding protagonist of Heroine Complex, I didn\u2019t yet realize I had anxiety, but I gave her many of my secret vulnerabilities: the fear of messing up, of not being enough, of literally burning her life down. But I also made her a hero\u2014someone who\u2019s living life and trying to do her best and is an undeniably strong person working through all her stuff. Because of her, I try to be a little kinder to myself\u2014and to recognize that sometimes \u201cweakness\u201d is actually \u201cbeing human.\u2019\u201d Sarah Kuhn is the author of the Heroine Complex series.\n\nTehlor Kay Mejia \"Writing with depression and anxiety is such a mixed bag. Some days it\u2019s all I can do just to open my Word document and stare at it before closing it again. I think it\u2019s so important to be kind to ourselves as women of color trying to create with mental health issues, and to be kind to each other. For me, having a community that understands those feelings of guilt and inadequacy in the face of our struggles has made all the difference. Finding people who will forgive you when you can\u2019t, celebrate you when you can, and nudge you when you need it.\" Tehlor Kay Mejia is the author of the forthcoming When We Set the Dark on Fire, out in 2019.\n\nEmily X.R. Pan \u201cI didn't intend to write about depression. The early drafts of my novel were completely different. But books come alive when you're writing them\u2014they develop minds of their own, decide for themselves what to be. You\u2019ve likely heard the expression \u201csaving face.\u201d In Chinese and Taiwanese culture the concept of \u201cface\u201d is much more intense: It comes from Confucianism, and especially focuses on \u201closing face.\u201d The shame of that damages your ability to function within your community. I was taught that mental illness is something to hide, to avoid losing face. I saw how the stigma made people I love afraid to ask for help. How my family lost one of our own to suicide. Once I gave myself permission to write about my family\u2019s experience, a door opened. I hadn\u2019t realized how much I needed to talk about it. Writing became my way to help fight that stigma.\u201d Emily X.R. Pan is the author of the forthcoming The Astonishing Color of After.\n\nSonia Patel \u201cI grew up in a misogynistic, abusive Gujarati Indian immigrant family with mental health problems on both sides. But nothing was wrong with anything, of course. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve spent most of my life recovering from the fallout of \u201cnothing.\u201d There are, however, two positive things that came out of all this pain. First, I became a child & adolescent psychiatrist who is passionate about helping teens work through their struggles with talk therapy. Second, I began writing. Rap at first. It helped me heal. At some point I read my binder full of rap in a certain order. There was a story! That\u2019s how Rani Patel In Full Effect was born. It was my story and that of other teens and women I\u2019d treated. I figured the young adult world would benefit from more diversity in depictions of how dysfunctional family systems and other unfortunate life circumstances could lead a teen down a dark path of low self-worth, negative thoughts, negative feelings, poor decision making, self-harm, lack of identity development, difficulties in interpersonal relationships, and inabilities in setting appropriate boundaries with people. Things I knew all too well. Not just from medical school and residency training. But from personal experience.\u201d Sonia Patel is the author of Rani Patel In Full Effect and Jaya and Rasa: A Love Story.\n\nIsabel Quintero Charles Lenida \u201cThe first time I had an anxiety attack I was 15. My cousins convinced my mom to let me go to this Mexican dance club for the first time. As soon as we got there I saw a really hot guy and hoped he\u2019d ask me to dance. He did. We got on the dance floor, banda was playing, his arms were around me, he asked me about myself and then\u2026 I couldn\u2019t breathe. I\u2019d gotten overwhelmed with the experience and the 'why did he ask me' question that would\u2019t stop. In my mid-twenties I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety, but mental health isn\u2019t something we really talk about in the Mexican community, though I know it worries my family, especially my mom. Most days I do okay, but there are days when it\u2019s so crippling I can\u2019t even pick nail polish colors. I also have bouts of depression, when it\u2019s tough to will my body to move, but luckily I have friends and family who remind me to breathe and to get out of bed. And, of course, I have my writing which gives me a way to try and make sense of things.\u201d Isabel Quintero is the author of Ugly Cat and Pablo, Gabi, a Girl in Pieces, and the forthcoming Photographic: The Life of Graciela Iturbide.\n\nTara Sim \u201cHaving an anxiety disorder and depression is difficult. Being an author in addition to that makes most days seem impossible. For instance, the industry is unpredictable, and it often leads to panic attacks. I didn\u2019t even realize I had anxiety until recently, and suddenly it made sense why all of my main characters had some form of it. I think it was my way of trying to understand myself through someone else \u2014 discovering how they deal with their symptoms, what their triggers are, and how I could translate that into what I feel on a daily basis. Words have a healing power, and I found mine through crafting characters I could sympathize with.\u201d Tara Sim is the author of the Timekeeper trilogy.", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/p/12-women-of-color-native-authors-open-up-about-why-they-write-about-mental-illness-2884690", "summary": "According to the World Health Organization, one in five adults experience mental illness in a year.\nGiven those numbers, it seems pretty much impossible that mental illness is only a white man\u2019s disease.\nHere's why they do it:Brandy Colbert \u201cI often write about mental health in my work because mental illness was never talked about when I was young.\nS.

What\u2019s so frightening about Dirty John \u2014 which, I think, is also what makes it so valuable \u2014 is that it\u2019s yet another reminder that the scariest monsters in the world aren\u2019t the ones we see in movies or on TV. They\u2019re humans. Just humans.\n\nA joint production between the LA Times and Wondery (who, by the way, is also behind for some of my favorite podcasts ever \u2014 have you listened to Inside Psycho or Inside The Exorcist? No? I recommend you get on that ASAP, particularly if you\u2019re interested in true crime, weird news, and film history), Dirty John follows the story of Debra Newell's relationship with John Meehan, a con man and emotional abuser with a history of preying upon women. Reported, written, and hosted by Christopher Goffard, it\u2019s a remarkable piece of journalism; then again, if you read Goffard\u2019s series on Kelli Peters and Kent and Jill Easter last year, you already know the caliber of work you can expect from this latest venture.\n\nUnlike the Dirty John article series, the podcast, which was initially announced in September with all six episodes subsequently dropping last week, begins at the end, with an autopsy report. The question is whether the incident that resulted in the body being examined is a prosecutable offense. At the end of the description of the stab wounds \u2014 13 of them \u2014 Matt Murphy, an assistant district attorney who handles homicides out of Newport Beach, Calif., arrives at the following conclusion: \u201cWhen you review something like this, what it tells you is, this young woman fought like hell.\u201d\n\nEverything else that you\u2019ll hear in Dirty John leads up to that incident.\n\nHoly crap, just finished the \"Dirty John\" podcast. It's a must listen. And I'd like to talk with someone about it. \u2014 Lindsay Gibbs (@linzsports) October 8, 2017\n\nIn October of 2014, Debra Newell was 59, ran a successful interior design firm, had four grown kids, and had been married and divorced four times. She was dating, although she hadn\u2019t felt a real spark with any of the men that she met \u2014 until she met John Meehan. At first, he seemed charming: Tall, strong, smart, and romantic. He had kids, and said he had a couple of houses \u2014 one in Newport Beach, one in Palm Springs. He said he was a doctor, and that he\u2019d just finished up a year working with Doctors Without Borders.\n\nHe was not a doctor. He had been through nursing school, but he was not a doctor. He had never worked with Doctors Without Borders.\n\nNewell wouldn\u2019t find this out until many months later, afterhe had already convinced her to marry him.\n\nThere were signs even on that first date that Meehan might not be the wonderful person he seemed to be. Newell was flattered by his attention, even though she felt he was moving a little fast; she brought him back to her penthouse after their date. He wanted to do more than she did, though, and they fought; he wouldn\u2019t leave. Getting him out the door was a struggle.\n\nNewell didn\u2019t count on hearing from him again \u2014 but he reached out soon after to apologize, and they began a relationship. Newell\u2019s children didn\u2019t like him, especially Terra, then 23, and Jacquelyn, 24. But by December of that year, he convinced her to marry him.\n\nIt was not the happy ending Newell was hoping for. And it would all come to a head less than two years later.\n\nI first heard about Dirty John shortly after the sixth and final installment was published on Oct. 8; as a result, I spent Tuesday night this week powering through the article series. I also came to it having just finished The Gift of Fear by Gavin de Becker \u2014 something I\u2019d been meaning to read for a while \u2014 and with all of that fresh in my mind as I fell deeper and deeper into Dirty John, all I could think was, \u201cThis is exactly why we need to hear these kinds of stories.\u201d\n\nThe Gift of Fear is something that I feel like everyone should read; however, I feel like this is especially true for women and gender nonconforming people, who are often at a much greater risk for intimate partner violence, sexual violence, and other such occurrences. (This isn\u2019t to say that cisgender men are not at risk for any of these things; however, it\u2019s been well-documented that people who are pretty much anything other than cisgender men are disproportionately affected.) The chapter on domestic abuse and intimate partner violence is, as many others have observed, not great; it\u2019s very much a product of de Becker\u2019s personal history, but that doesn\u2019t excuse the high levels of victim-blaming present in it. Despite this chapter, though, the lessons taught throughout the book are immensely valuable: So much of it centers around learning to trust your intuition \u2014 if you feel apprehensive or scared of someone, you\u2019ve probably unconsciously picked up on a number of cues that mean your apprehension is very, very justified.\n\nWith all of this in mind, what Dirty John nails is how hard it can be to leave an abusive relationship. One of the most commonly asked \u2014 and most harmful \u2014 questions of people who have suffered abusive relationships is, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just leave?\u201d And the bottom line is that it is rarely, if ever, as simple as \u201cjust leaving.\u201d Leaving requires money; but the abuser might control all of the household\u2019s finances, making money inaccessible to survivors. Leaving requires a team of people who can help you and who have your back; but the abuser might have isolated their target, leaving them feeling alone and with nowhere to turn. Abusers groom the people they prey upon, using tactics like gaslighting to twist their targets\u2019 perceptions. Targets don\u2019t trust themselves; they\u2019ve been separated from other friends and family; the only person they have to rely on \u2014 and the only person who seems to want and love them \u2014 is, seemingly, the abuser. Leaving may not ultimately be safe.\n\nIt takes, on average, seven attempts for someone to leave an abuser for good, according to the National Domestic Violence Hotline.\n\nWhat our #DirtyJohn true-crime series reveals about domestic abuse and coercive control https://t.co/N5YodLMLYu pic.twitter.com/QF2WDt1ENC \u2014 Los Angeles Times (@latimes) October 11, 2017\n\nIt's no wonder that according to a 2010 study, women consume substantially more true crime media than men do. I don\u2019t think this is a coincidence, or an accident; I think there\u2019s a very real reason for it, as does one of the study\u2019s co-authors: Social psychologist Amanda Vicary, who worked on the study, told The Atlantic in February, \u201c[Women have] adapted to pay attention to anything that can help us increase our survival. So it could be the fact that we\u2019re just in tune and interested in these things that are dangerous to us because understanding and knowing about them can increase our chances that it\u2019s not going to happen to us.\u201d Or, perhaps, if it does happen to us, that we\u2019ll have the survival skills necessary to make it out alive. Probably not unscathed \u2014 but alive.\n\nI think it\u2019s important that we don\u2019t consume true crime media solely as entertainment. This issue came up frequently during the craze surrounding the first season of Serial; ultimately, the people featured in this media are real people, and these are real things that have actually happened, so to treat it just as entertainment feels enormously disrespectful.But if we truly engage with it, this kind of material can literally be life-saving.\n\nConsider this: According to a 2011 survey commissioned by Glamour and developed by Harris Interactive with counsel from the National Resource Center on Domestic Violence(NRCDV), the National Network to End Domestic Violence, the National Domestic Violence Hotline, Casa Esperanza, and the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, nearly 60 percent of women between the ages of 18 and 35 have experienced abuse in a relationship; 29 percent said they had actually been in an abusive relationship, while 30 percent said they\u2019d never been in an abusive relationship, but reported experiencing abusive behavior.\n\nAll of which is to say that there are lots of Dirty Johns out there. I hate that we currently live in a world where this is the case \u2014 where we are taught that it\u2019s an abuse survivor\u2019s job to stop or escape their own abuse, rather than a world where people are taught not to abuse others in the first place. But while we\u2019re still living in this world \u2014 one that is regularly dangerous to us \u2014 we need stories like this one. We need them to survive.", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/p/the-dirty-john-podcast-is-six-episodes-of-anxiety-inducing-dating-app-tale-gone-horribly-wrong-2901677", "summary": "Unlike the Dirty John article series, the podcast, which was initially announced in September with all six episodes subsequently dropping last week, begins at the end, with an autopsy report.\nHoly crap, just finished the \"Dirty John\" podcast.\nI first heard about Dirty John shortly after the sixth and final installment was published on Oct. 8; as a result, I spent Tuesday night this week powering through the article series.\nWith all of this in mind, what Dirty John nails is how hard it can be to leave an abusive relationship.\nIt takes, on average, seven attempts for someone to leave an abuser for good, according to the National Domestic Violence Hotline.", "timescraped": 1513838459.423567, "category": {"words": 1488, "personal": 26, "thirdperson": 39, "condition": 0, "recovery": 0}}, "7d89ff5b828b006ac065a23d5b237a53": {"title": "Worried About Infertility Even Though You're Young And Have Never Tried To Conceive?

But as it turns out, my friend was on to something. Over the next year or so, as conversations about babies became more prevalent within my age group, I talked to more and more women who felt the same way. We were all younger than 30, and though we'd never tried, we shared the same worry we'd never be able to conceive.\n\nWhile the discourse about infertility is beyond needed, it can also have an unintended side effect: In some cases, women are changing their life plans based on the fear that they too will have trouble conceiving.\n\n\n\nA post on a babyandbump.com discussion board sums it up best: \u201cI thought I was the only one!

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 94 percent of American women are fertile and 89 percent will not have any trouble getting pregnant. The numbers are similar in Great Britain, where according to the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, 90 percent of women age 19\u201339 will conceive after two years of actively trying to have a baby.\n\nYet panic remains, and it\u2019s not hard to see why. Infertility is real. The stigma attached to childless women is real. Watching others suffer from infertility is gut wrenching, and imagining going through that painful experience contributes to women\u2019s fears and doctors\u2019 warnings.\n\nJulianne Zweifel, a clinical psychologist and clinical adjunct professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, regularly witnesses the heartbreak of infertility in her profession. '[If you're young], the odds [of getting pregnant] are still dramatically in your favor,\" she says. \u201cBut if you\u2019re the person on the negative end of that percentage, it\u2019s bad. When you are 30 years old and you have fertility problems, you are even angrier than when you\u2019re 36.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have a backdrop in society of women having kids later and later,\u201d Zweifel says. \u201cYou think, \u2018Maybe this is more possible\u2019 and you\u2019re lulled into a false sense of security. [But] we weren\u2019t just created in 2014 with bodies that were created in 2014. It really might work out, but the older you get, the less likely that is.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe other side of this story \u2014 unplanned pregnancies or rushed timelines \u2014 has consequences of its own: financial stress, sacrificing an education or a career, relationship/marriage struggles, resentment and low self-esteem, just to name a few.\n\n\n\nHalf of pregnancies in this country are unplanned, and 40 percent of those end in abortion.\n\nColleen Krajewski, M.D. MPH, a gynecologist affiliated with The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, feels strongly about drawing equal attention to the consequences of perceived infertility, especially because they are more likely to occur than infertility itself. Half of pregnancies in this country are unplanned, and 40 percent of those end in abortion.\n\n\u201cThis seems much less talked about than infertility,\" Krajewski says. \"My perspective is that I see women on an almost daily basis who have an unintended pregnancy based on incorrectly perceived infertility, and my patients can also feel ashamed, guilty, or stigmatized.\u201d\n\nWith a barrage of statistics and an endless supply of messages on infertility floating around, Zweifel and Krajewski agree that women must educate themselves and visit their doctors to gain a thorough understanding of what all this information means. Basing a decision on one article, a targeted campaign, or what a friend heard may not be the best approach.\n\n\n\nFor example, women hear all the time that age affects fertility. Although this is true and should not be taken lightly, it\u2019s important to understand how and to what extent it plays a role. The chances of becoming pregnant quickly (within a year) decrease significantly as women age, particularly after age 35.\n\nAccording to a study in Helen A. Cacio's Management of the Infertile Woman, women ages 20\u201324 have an 86 percent chance of conceiving within a year. Women ages 30\u201334 have a 63 percent chance. The chances of women of all those ages becoming pregnant after trying for two years, however, leaps up to 90\u201394 percent.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s good to talk to your doctor about any risk factors you may actually have, as opposed to perceive, with regard to infertility, and also the actual incidence of infertility with age,\u201d Krajewski says.\n\n\"I encourage women and couples to parent when they are ready. Don't push up your timetable based on fear.\"\n\nShe also suggests setting aside a specific visit for \u201cpreconception counseling,\u201d rather than asking a quick question at the end of an annual exam, to ensure a thorough review of medical history and enough time to create a plan for optimizing pregnancy chances.\n\n\u201cEach woman can make a decision about what risk of infertility she\u2019s OK with,\u201d Krajewski says. \u201cI encourage women and couples to parent when they are ready. Don\u2019t push up your timetable based on fear. On the other hand, have a realistic expectation that conception may not be as easy at age 40 as at age 20.\u201d\n\nAt age 29, I now feel a sense of peace having a better understanding of fertility. I also visited my gynecologist specifically to ask questions and better understand my fertility.\n\nI want children badly, but I also know that now is not the right time. Although I\u2019ll never truly know if I can get pregnant until I try, it\u2019s immensely liberating to allow logic to lead the way. Deciding when and why to have children is a personal decision for every woman, and knowledge, not fear, will breed the best choices.", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/61246-worried-about-infertility-even-though-youre-young-and-have-never-tried-to-conceive-youre-not-the", "summary": "Courtney Unger, a nurse and mother of two living in Minneapolis, was fairly certain she would have trouble getting pregnant when she was married at 25.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 94 percent of American women are fertile and 89 percent will not have any trouble getting pregnant.\n'[If you're young], the odds [of getting pregnant] are still dramatically in your favor,\" she says.\n\u201cThis seems much less talked about than infertility,\" Krajewski says.\nThe chances of becoming pregnant quickly (within a year) decrease significantly as women age, particularly after age 35.", "timescraped": 1513838460.75828, "category": {"words": 1274, "personal": 29, "thirdperson": 19, "condition": 0, "recovery": 0}}, "767d30cbf0cad3be21e400e3289f33cb": {"title": "11 Common Things People Lie To Themselves About & How To Stop Immediately", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/uploads/image/2017/6/8/99afe327-f71c-43af-9da7-deb61e870bb4-bustle_102416_292.jpg?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "text": "You might think you're being honest with yourself, but it's common to fall into the trap of some serious denial (especially when you're in the wrong). Unfortunately, there are many things people lie to themselves about, and they're also not super obvious, so it's possible to get stuck in a bad habit that's tough to break out of. It's better to be real with yourself, though, so you can always keep improving in areas that might need some work.\n\nAs a certified health coach, I work with clients on staying true to themselves and really owning their authentic power. Sometimes certain relationships or situations might make you feel less like yourself (or that you won't be accepted if you lay all the cards out); yet, it's better to realize that surrounding yourself with those who like you for all your traits and really understand who you are will benefit you and your own idea of self-worth in the long run. Plus, it's never good to be dishonest with yourself, as if you can't be true, it'll be hard to come off as a genuine person to others (no one should know you better than you know yourself, right?). So, here are 11 common lies you might tell yourself and how to quit the nasty habit.\n\n1. That Narcissism Will Change\n\nAccording to Dr. Ramani Durvasula, a therapist and professor, over email with Bustle, if you think you're not narcissistic, or that your partner isn't, but all signs point towards yes, it's better to get out, as the trait likely won't change. \"If s/he is entitled, grandiose, superficial, arrogant, and lacks empathy - s/he won't change. And your love won't change them. This is an important insight before you waste months, years or decades trying to change them,\" Durvasula says. It sounds extreme, but it's pretty real, and it can be tough to deal with.\n\n2. That Exercise Alone Will Make You Healthy\n\nOf course, exercising regularly is great for your health and wellbeing, and it does aid in weight management and better heart health. Yet, it's not an excuse to eat all the cookies you want (well you could, but you might increase risk for disease). Instead, \"focus on healthy nutritional calories - (no fads), fruits and vegetables, multigrains, lean proteins, healthy hydration - there are no shortcuts - so work on cleaning the cupboards and eating mindfully,\" suggets Durvasula.\n\n3. That You Can \"Fix\" People\n\nIt's impossible (and not right) to control other people or try and \"fix\" their qualities that you don't necessarily appreciate, says NYC based therapist, Kimberly Hershenson, LMSW, to Bustle. \"People also lie to themselves about being able to fix people. We think we can change a selfish friend or make a boyfriend stop drinking. People only change when they want to change,\" Hershenson adds.\n\n4. That You Can Control Every Situation\n\nSimilar to above but in a greater context, there are some things in life you simply can't control: Being fired, the weather, a work meeting you'd rather not have but know is necessary, and more. Instead, \"practice acceptance,\" says Hershenson. \"Make a list of what you can control in the situation and what you can't control. Focus on what you can control to make change and accept what you cannot control,\" Hershenson recommends.\n\n5. That You Don't Have Enough Time\n\nPlease. There's always enough time for things that matter. Quit this excuse, advises Tara Bradford, a growth strategist and career coach, over email with Bustle. Instead, \"reassess your priorities,\" says Bradford. \"Make time for things that matter and stop making time for things that don't. Once you're clear on what your goals are you will know exactly what you should be saying yes to,\" Bradford adds.\n\n6. That You Don't Need Sunscreen\n\nAccording to Tsippora Shainhouse, MD, FAAD, a board-certified dermatologist in Beverly Hills and a Clinical Instructor at the University of Southern California, over email with Bustle, it's common to think you're invincible, and a few spare minutes out in the sun won't do damage. Same with tanning beds. But, those minutes sunscreen-free can cause free radical damage and increase risk of skin cancer, Shainhouse warns. Wear daily block to stay safe.\n\n7. That You'll Save When You're Older\n\n\"Folks seem to gloss over their personal finances unless there is an emergency,\" says life coach KJ Landis over email with Bustle. Landis went through a similar process, where she spent many nights in LA heading to lavish dinners and events, and then found financial distress. Instead, start saving young and be honest with what type of lifestyle you can afford.\n\n8. That You're Not [Blank] Enough\n\n\"The way to stop lying to yourself about how incredibly enough you are, is to start taking stock of all of the qualities and attributes that make you the awesome person you are,\" says Shirani M. Pathak, LCSW from the Relationship Center of Silicon Valley to Bustle. \"Everyday, keep a list of at least 3 things you like about yourself, or things other people have said they like about you. You can repeat things to start and it might feel really awkward in the beginning. Don't worry, as with anything, this will get easier and more comfortable with time,\" Pathak recommends.\n\n9. That Your \"Intuition\" Isn't Real\n\nHere's a hint: Trust your gut. \"People often lie to themselves about their intuition or what their 'gut feelings' are telling them,\" says Pathak. \"For example, when you get that feeling your partner is cheating on you and you lie to yourself and tell yourself it's not true. Then, when you actually find out the truth about being cheated on, you get that 'If only I had listened to myself' thought,\" Pathak uses as an example. \"The best way to work on trusting your intuition is to simply allow yourself to feel it,\" Pathak suggests.\n\n10. That You're Not Addicted To Something\n\nBe it drugs, sex, or even sugar, denying an addiction for too long can be life threatening. \"We lie to ourselves when there is something we don\u2019t want to take a look at, because we believe it will be too painful to confront. This often shows up in cases of addiction,\" says Tiffany Louise, LCSW, Therapist & Life Coach to Bustle. \"People who struggle with alcohol and drug abuse will often make excuses for their consumption, hide it, or create stories that justify it. The addicted brain is set up for denial of the problem, because it becomes wired to prioritize the chemical above all else,\" Louise explains. Instead, it's better to be brave and seek help early on.\n\n11. That You're Out Of Options\n\nOften, you might think you're out of options (for the future) and so you cling to the past (even when it's toxic). Instead, try and seek hope that you can have a fresh start with a prominent change. \"This starts with having compassion for lying to yourself in the first place. We can do this by telling ourselves we were doing the best we could with what we had at the time, and we were only trying to avoid more pain. Then we can take an inventory of the honest facts. We can ask ourselves what the cost of continuing to avoid addressing the issue is, and we can use this information to leverage ourselves into making a change,\" recommends Louise.\n\nIf you see any of these lies popping up in your life, it's best to address them head on and come to terms with the truth, moving forward.", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/p/11-common-things-people-lie-to-themselves-about-how-to-stop-immediately-62621", "summary": "You might think you're being honest with yourself, but it's common to fall into the trap of some serious denial (especially when you're in the wrong).\n\"If s/he is entitled, grandiose, superficial, arrogant, and lacks empathy - s/he won't change.\nAnd your love won't change them.\n\"Make time for things that matter and stop making time for things that don't.\nThat You're Out Of OptionsOften, you might think you're out of options (for the future) and so you cling to the past (even when it's toxic).", "timescraped": 1513838462.161728, "category": {"words": 1283, "personal": 14, "thirdperson": 11, "condition": 0, "recovery": 0}}, "c8b0f52466788d6578234aef0ae616a3": {"title": "8 Ways To Manage Anxiety When You Leave For College, Because It Can Be A Stressful Time", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost%2F2016%2F9%2F13%2Fce370595-971f-488c-afe3-eeee8f478464.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "text": "If you struggle with anxiety, the idea of leaving for college can be a terrifying one. And you know what? That's a totally realistic and rational way to feel. But, know that there are plenty of ways to manage anxiety when you leave for college, too. That's right, we are going to get through this together.\n\nAnxiety can be a nasty monster. It can creep up on you when you least expect it, and leave you quivering in your boots without any specific reason as to why. It's also a totally common thing for humans to experience. Anxiety affects close to 18 percent of the population. That's basically like one in every five people. (And to be honest, I bet the real stat would be a lot higher than that if there was any error-free way of figuring that information out.)\n\nIf you are a little nervous about going to college, you are definitely not the only one. If you are flat out anxious about going to college, you are also not the only one. That knowledge in and of itself can be a huge relief. While leaving for a university can be a giant and challenging step for people with anxiety, it can also be an experience that is beyond rewarding. Take the proper precautions, and do what you can to make the transition easier, because you have that power.\n\n1. Schedule an appointment with an on-campus therapist.\n\n[Embed]\n\nAs a full-time student, you are likely going to have health insurance through your university. Take advantage of that. Most campuses have a mental health center that's there specifically to serve college students. Sign yourself up for an intake appointment as soon as you arrive at college, even if you don't feel particularly anxious yet. Therapy is a powerful way to help treat anxiety, and having that tool available to you while you're living on campus is priceless.\n\n\n\n2. Let your roommate and R.A. know.\n\n[Embed]\n\nSometimes half the struggle of having anxiety is feeling like you have to keep it a secret. Sure, you don't have to make it the ice-breaking conversation you have with every new friend you make at college, but you'll likely drop some weight off of your shoulders by letting the people you'll be living with know. It only takes a couple minutes to explain your anxiety to your roommate and your R.A., and trust me, they will not think you're weird for it.\n\n\n\n3. Don't feel obligated to attend every event...\n\n[Embed]\n\nThere's a lot of pressure during that first year of college to attend every single event. Don't stress yourself out. If you skip some concerts and BBQ socials, you're not going to ruin your chances of having a social life. Go to the events that feel comfortable to you, and be OK with skipping the ones that you think might trigger your anxiety.\n\n\n\n4. ...but try to keep busy.\n\n[Embed]\n\nThat being said, don't keep yourself locked in your dorm room. Keep the door open for socializing, find some student interest groups that you're interested in, and keep up with your school work. Letting the mind wander is just about the worst thing a person with anxiety can do, so make sure you're actively trying to keep yourself busy and engaged with the community around you.\n\n\n\n5. Have someone off-campus that you can call regularly.\n\n[Embed]\n\nBefore you leave for college, find somebody that you know you can call regularly once you arrive. It can be your mom, it can be your dad, it can be your sister or best friend. Sometimes talking to someone who isn't so intimately involved with campus life at your university can be a wonderful outlet. They'll look at things objectively and remind you that school isn't the end-all be-all.\n\n\n\n6. Keep a journal.\n\n[Embed]\n\nKeep a journal to record your feelings. Ideally, write in it every single day. Whether you're feeling great or on the verge of having an anxiety attack, the process of writing things down helps bring your mind back down to earth and out of the clouds. Journals are also great to read over if you're having a bad day, because it reminds you of times you've felt relaxed and happy in the past, and how you've overcome anxiety before.\n\n\n\n7. Create a back-up plan.\n\n[Embed]\n\nEven if you never need to use it, sometimes coming up with a mental back-up plan can help calm an anxious mind. Know where the closest airport is or what you could do if you decided you needed to go back home for a couple days. You'll likely never act on it, but knowing that it's always an option can be an instant comfort.\n\n\n\n8. Pat yourself on the back.\n\n[Embed]\n\nFinally, and most importantly, pat yourself on the back. You're going to college, and that's a really big deal. Don't let anyone try to convince you that moving your entire life onto an unfamiliar campus should be easy. Not everyone can do it, and the fact that you're giving it a go speaks volumes about your strength.\n\n\n\nImage: kaboompics/Pexels; Giphy", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/170481-8-ways-to-manage-anxiety-when-you-leave-for-college-because-it-can-be-a-stressful", "summary": "But, know that there are plenty of ways to manage anxiety when you leave for college, too.\nSign yourself up for an intake appointment as soon as you arrive at college, even if you don't feel particularly anxious yet.\n[Embed]Sometimes half the struggle of having anxiety is feeling like you have to keep it a secret.\nDon't feel obligated to attend every event...[Embed]There's a lot of pressure during that first year of college to attend every single event.\nYou're going to college, and that's a really big deal.", "timescraped": 1513838441.133527, "category": {"words": 858, "personal": 2, "thirdperson": 2, "condition": 12, "recovery": 0}}, "1efcb29c311961593f0db8e3afb274ee": {"title": "Can Stress Cause Physical Illness?

If you think your anxiety and stress is causing you physical illness, it's not all in your head. In addition to making you feel sick, hormones released when you experience anxiety can weaken your immune system, which means you are more likely to get a cold or the flu. According to Harvard's Women Health Watch from Harvard Medical School, \"Evidence suggests that people with anxiety disorders are at greater risk for developing a number of chronic medical conditions.\"\n\nThe reason anxiety can trigger physical symptoms is because when you're anxious, your brain puts your body on alert, even if you're not actually in danger. \"[Anxiety's] physical effects can be counterproductive, causing light-headedness, nausea, diarrhea, and frequent urination,\" Harvard Women's Health Watch reported. \"And when it persists, anxiety can take a toll on our mental and physical health.\"\n\nPersonally, when I get anxious I have to pee 10 times more than I normally do, my neck and shoulders tense into a vice grip, and I feel consistently nauseous. While the physical effects of anxiety are real, Harvard noted that the study of anxiety manifesting in the body is still in its infancy, which means some doctors might not recognize connections between anxiety and physical illnesses.\n\nThe Connection Between Anxiety & Physical Illness\n\n\"Anxiety often goes unidentified as a source of other disorders, such as substance abuse or physical addiction, that can result from attempts to quell feelings of anxiety,\" Harvard Women's Health Watch explained. \"And it's often overlooked in the myriad symptoms of chronic conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or migraine headache [...] Anxiety has been implicated in several chronic physical illnesses, including heart disease, chronic respiratory disorders, and gastrointestinal conditions.\"\n\nIf you suffer from anxiety on the regular, then you know the struggle is real. And, sometimes, anxiety about getting a stomachache or a headache because you're feeling anxious can trap you in a cycle of anxiety that causes even more distress in your body. The Calm Clinic reported that because anxiety causes the release of the stress hormone cortisol in bulk all throughout your body, anxiety may even weaken your immune system, which, in addition to triggering chronic illnesses, can leave you more vulnerable to developing things like a cold or the flu.\n\n\"Cortisol weakens your immune system for a good reason. During periods of intense stress, as though you were about to face a predator, cortisol is trying to help reduce inflammation by weakening some of the antibodies that can increase inflammation,\" the Calm Clinic explained on its website. While you want your antibodies to take a break for the above reason, once the threat is over, you need them to get back to work ASAP. When that doesn't happen, your immune system takes a hit.\n\nAnxiety Can Weaken Your Immune System\n\nWhile in the short term the release of cortisol is helpful, in a long-term anxiety spiral is can leave you vulnerable. \"When you experience prolonged stress, your body needs those T-cells and white blood cells, and unfortunately, cortisol continues to suppress them, thus weakening your immune system over time.\"\n\nIt's important to note that anxiety does not actually cause you to get sick, however, when your immune system is compromised you are likely to get sick more often, and it can take you longer to recover. If you feel like you're in a cycle of anxiety and illness, the first step to boosting your immune system is addressing your anxiety. The Calm Clinic recommends a few things that might make you feel less anxious while also strengthening your immune system, including exercise, staying hydrated, and massage.\n\nIf you deal with regular anxiety, the last thing you probably want is one more person giving you tips on how to manage your anxiety. I get it. Everyone is different, and just because running helped one person reduce anxiety does not mean it's going to work for you. Yoga is one thing that is suggested to me over and over again, but because I have chronic neck and shoulder pain from a childhood injury, yoga (except for aerial yoga and restorative yoga) actually hurts my body, which in turn causes me more anxiety about having more pain.\n\nReducing Anxiety Helps Your Body Stay Healthy\n\nIt's important to find something that works for you, and that might mean trying a lot of different things that don't work before you find something that does. Personally, meditation has helped me a lot, and when I don't meditate I can feel anxiety building up in my body. During cold and flu season, it's hard to stay well, and having a weakened immune system makes it much more difficult, so finding what works for you is an important step for staying healthy.\n\nYou need to stay hydrated anyways, so that one is a no brainer. Massage is also something that's pretty enjoyable, so go ahead and get one. You deserve it. You can also check out these expert tips for staying healthy during times of stress, like the holidays. Additionally, Harvard Medical School posted some proven relaxation techniques that can help reduce your anxiety. If you do end up getting sick, make sure you take care of yourself so you can increase your chances of recovering more quickly.\n\nAnxiety can be a spiral that turns into a self-fulfilling prophecy when it's left unchecked. Anything you can do to safely stop your anxiety cycle can decrease your odds of weakening your immune system. And, remember, it's OK to ask for help. It really does take a village, and you are definitely not alone.", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/p/can-stress-cause-physical-illness-this-is-how-anxiety-affects-your-immune-system-7524590", "summary": "If you think your anxiety and stress is causing you physical illness, it's not all in your head.\nThe Connection Between Anxiety & Physical Illness\"Anxiety often goes unidentified as a source of other disorders, such as substance abuse or physical addiction, that can result from attempts to quell feelings of anxiety,\" Harvard Women's Health Watch explained.\n\"Cortisol weakens your immune system for a good reason.\nIf you feel like you're in a cycle of anxiety and illness, the first step to boosting your immune system is addressing your anxiety.\nAnything you can do to safely stop your anxiety cycle can decrease your odds of weakening your immune system.", "timescraped": 1513838442.509592, "category": {"words": 958, "personal": 12, "thirdperson": 1, "condition": 28, "recovery": 0}}, "07562cd9bc03aef4a2e7e271d6dfd889": {"title": "Physical Ways Anxiety & Depression Can Harm The Body", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost%2F2016%2F11%2F15%2F81fbe133-f5b4-4a87-adf1-bc246b7dc6fd.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "text": "If you\u2019re one of the 40 million American adults who suffers from anxiety, or you count yourself among the 19 million Americans who battle depression, then you don\u2019t need me to tell you that mental illness literally hurts. At best, depression causes all-over body aches, while chronic anxiety results in stiff muscles, jaw pain, and headaches. On a more serious scale, both anxiety and depression can increase your risk of developing diabetes and heart disease.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t currently struggle with an anxiety disorder or depressive episodes, learning about the physical manifestations of anxiety and depression is still a good idea. Millions of Americans deal with the health risks of mental illness on a daily basis, and even if you're not one of them, there\u2019s a pretty good chance you know and love someone who is struggling.\n\nMoreover, now that the majority of Americans are dealing with post-election stress and depression on top of their day-to-day anxiety and/or depression symptoms, staying informed about how the mind affects the body is probably more important than ever. The best thing any of us can do right now is take care of ourselves \u2014 because only then will we have the mental and physical strength to take care of and protect one another in the coming days.\n\nAnxiety And Depression Mess With Appetite\n\n[Embed]\n\nI'm fairly certain that anyone who suffers from anxiety and depression would cite changes in appetite as one of their most consistent side effects \u2014 I know I would. As Gary Kennedy, MD, director of geriatric psychiatry at Montefiore Medical Center in Bronx, New York, told Everyday Health back in 2012, \"Loss of appetite can be an early sign of depression or a warning of a depression relapse. On the other hand, some people can't stop eating when they are depressed.\" Unfortunately, appetite is one area where the connection between mental and physical health is pretty much impossible to avoid, and experts aren't 100 percent sure why. In the case of depression, changes in appetite often occur because depression sufferers are hit hard by a lack of energy and interest in all things, including food.\n\nWhen it comes to anxiety, there are a few possible causes for decreased or increased appetite. When anxiety causes someone to want to overeat, it's probably because eating is their go-to coping mechanism. According to Calm Clinic, if an anxious person is overeating, it's most likely because food allows them to \"experience a flood of positive neurotransmitters \u2014 brain chemicals that cause them to feel good.\"\n\nConversely, when anxiety makes food lose it's appeal, there's not just one possible reason. The experts over at Calm Clinic speculate that the reason \"anxiety reduces hunger in some people is because the excess stomach acids simply create the 'full' feeling for longer, and chemicals that signal hunger no longer reach the brain.\" However, since most people with anxiety also suffer from a serotonin imbalance \u2014 and serotonin is a neurotransmitter that plays a role in regulating mood and hunger \u2014 it's possible that anxious people consistently lose their appetite simply because they don't have enough serotonin to maintain a healthy appetite.\n\nAnxiety Can Cause Skin To Age Faster\n\n[Embed]\n\nSo let me be clear about this: it's OK to age. the last thing I would ever want to do is add to the ridiculous amount of pressure that women are put under to look 25 forever. Aging is a perfectly natural part of life, and wrinkles are nothing to be ashamed of. Period. All of that said, premature aging isn't great for you, and sometimes it shows up on our face.\n\nIt's important to remember that being physically healthy isn't the only requirement for aging well \u2014 mental health also plays a role in how we age. In fact, anxiety can actually cause skin to age faster than it should. When anxiety is triggered, the body's \"fight or flight\" reaction is set into motion, causing excess blood to be redistributed to our muscles. While this abrupt change of blood flow is awesome if you're running for your life or whatever, prolonged overexposure to this reaction is terrible for your skin, causing premature aging.\n\nAnxiety And Depression Can Cause Chronic Headaches\n\n[Embed]\n\nAs the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA) reports, \"people with a co-occurring anxiety disorder and migraines have an increased likelihood of experiencing major depression; as many as 40% of patients with migraine also experience depression.\" Also according to the ADAA, people who struggle with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) are at a particularly high risk of experiencing chronic and co-occurring headaches, and research also suggests a link between anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, and migraine headaches.\n\nThe good news is there are amply ways to fight headaches naturally and avoid headache triggers.\n\nAnxiety Can Cause Jaw Pain\n\n[Embed]\n\nIf you struggle with an anxiety disorder of any kind, then you probably don't need me to tell you that anxiety can cause jaw pain \u2014 but since anxiety and chronic stress have been linked to jaw pain at best and Temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJ) at worst, I think we need to talk about it.\n\nBecause anxiety makes your whole body tense up, people with anxiety (like myself) will often clench their jaws and/or tense the muscles in their faces without even realizing it. What's more is, anxious people typically clench their jaws and grind their teeth in their sleep as well. Inevitably, all of that pressure leads to near-constant jaw pain. Even worse, as Calm Clinic points out, \"anxiety can make what would be regular jaw pain feel more pronounced, so less jaw pain feels more painful because your mind can't stop focusing on the discomfort.\" So basically, anxiety and jaw pain are a vicious cycle.\n\nLuckily, there are actually lots of home remedies for treating anxiety in general, and anxiety-induced jaw pain in particular. For the latter, I recommend a hot cup of peppermint tea and a jaw massage.\n\nAnxiety Can Cause Hot And Cold Flashes\n\n[Embed]\n\nIron deficiencies, hypothyroidism, and a number of other physical ailments can cause chills. Conversely, everything from hormone disorders to hypoglycemia to certain medications can cause hot flashes. So if you've been dealing with lots of hot and cold flashes lately, then you should see your doctor about it so you can rule out any physical condition as the culprit.\n\nThat said, since anxiety excites our sympathetic nervous system in the same way that hormonal fluctuations do, it's quite possible that any hot and/or cold flashes you might be experiencing could be from your anxiety alone. If you think this might be the case for you, make an appointment with your primary care physician to talk about it.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nUntreated anxiety and depression can rule your life and wreck your physical health, so don't be ashamed to get help if you deal with either (or both) of these conditions. If you're going without health insurance right now, know that being uninsured doesn't mean you have to go without care. Don't underestimate the toll poor mental health can take on your overall well-being. Instead, check out these affordable alternatives to therapy, and find as many positive ways to manage your mental health as you can.\n\n\n\nImages: Pexels, Giphy/(5)", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/193512-physical-ways-anxiety-depression-can-harm-the-body", "summary": "At best, depression causes all-over body aches, while chronic anxiety results in stiff muscles, jaw pain, and headaches.\nEven if you don\u2019t currently struggle with an anxiety disorder or depressive episodes, learning about the physical manifestations of anxiety and depression is still a good idea.\nAnxiety And Depression Mess With Appetite[Embed]I'm fairly certain that anyone who suffers from anxiety and depression would cite changes in appetite as one of their most consistent side effects \u2014 I know I would.\nAnxiety And Depression Can Cause Chronic Headaches[Embed]As the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA) reports, \"people with a co-occurring anxiety disorder and migraines have an increased likelihood of experiencing major depression; as many as 40% of patients with migraine also experience depression.\"\nInstead, check out these affordable alternatives to therapy, and find as many positive ways to manage your mental health as you can.", "timescraped": 1513838443.792027, "category": {"words": 1210, "personal": 15, "thirdperson": 13, "condition": 47, "recovery": 0}}, "658f2bd45c05da51e31f135b8f1fbc59": {"title": "12 Books For Anxiety And Depression That'll Actually Help, According To Someone Who Felt Better After Reading Them", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost%2F2016%2F9%2F13%2Fd5ab3ebf-fb71-4a70-80a5-15fb7157e37d.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "text": "hate that stuff. So instead, I turned to books to help my anxiety and depression Recently, I found myself back in my doctor's office, talking about all the finer points of my anxiety . Again. Was I experiencing d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu? I'd certainly been there before. I'd been doing well, managing the feeling over the past few months. But then things got worse again, and there I was, with a mandate to focus on myself again to get better. What could I do, though? I\u2019ve never been one who finds mindfulness practices too great a help \u2014 scratch that, I\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I started this route, I searched the Internet for lists of books intended to help sufferers of anxiety and depression , but each one had the same repetitive framework: self-help books, novels about severely mentally ill people, etc. That\u2019s about as much of an escape as Steve McQueen getting stuck in the barbed wire at the last hurdle. So instead, I made my own list.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver 28 days, I read these 12 books, and revived a part of myself with each of them. I\u2019m sharing these books with you in the order in which I read them. Here I found my own series of escapes from anxiety and depression . I hope, just maybe, that you will, too.\n\nTo kick off my reboot, I delved into the book of the \u201ccool mom,\u201d the founder of the Pawnee Goddesses, and Hillary Clinton herself: Amy Poehler. In previous depressive episodes, I turned to Leslie Knope to make me feel like a \"poetic, noble land mermaid,\" so it was the natural way to begin. Reading her memoir, Amy gave me a new way of thinking, writing: \u201cWhen the demon starts to slither my way and say bad sh*t about me, I turn around and say, \u2018Hey. Cool it. Amy is my friend. Don\u2019t talk about her like that.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nClick here to buy\n\nNow, Lolita was one of the books I\u2019d kept meaning to read and never did. I wanted to read it so I could see a mind gone further than my own (and you can hardly get worse than one of a pedophile and murderer). Mind fog is no fun, but I\u2019d had my fair share of it recently. Lolita blew it all away and opened my eyes with its gorgeous prose, while at the same time making me see my problems more clearly, and not as something to be ashamed of.\n\nClick here to buy\n\nI\u2019ve never been someone who exactly \"fits in.\" when I was five, I would get angry if anyone referred to Claude Monet by only his surname. When I was seven, Louis Braille became one of my idols. And when I was 15, I was the only one in my class who knew who Morrissey was. I mean, yeah, I was totally cool and cultured and badass, but that doesn\u2019t mean much if no one appreciates it with you.\n\nI read Jill for the narrative of a fellow outsider. In the novel, protagonist John Kemp is an outcast with an imaginary sister named Jill. In this book, the outsider is appreciated, and I felt appreciated, too.\n\nClick here to buy\n\nI wanted to read the book before finally seeing the film \u2014 I can only put off watching Leo for so long \u2014 but I am so glad I did. In Yates, I have found a new favorite writer. He writes bleakness perfectly, without making you feel worse. Sure, Frank Wheeler is a class-A jerk, and his marriage is one of the least enviable in literature, but this book is depressing in a cathartic way.\n\n\n\nClick here to buy\n\nPerfume is not for the lighthearted; this ain't no Chanel No.5. The seediness of this book is addictive. There\u2019s no attempt to make the character\u2019s actions excusable; he is a murdering psychopath (who just happens to make great perfume, no biggie). In a twisted way, this book taught me that it\u2019s OK to give into your own depression on occasion, to wallow when you need to wallow, because it can ease it in the long run. Just don\u2019t go on a murdering spree to do so, because that'll get you arrested. To say the least.\n\nClick here to buy\n\nMy dad recommended A Visit from the Goon Squad a couple of years back, and in typical child fashion, I nodded my head and didn\u2019t read it \u2026 until now. Props to Papa Bryant, because Jennifer Egan can write. The interweaving of narratives in this book is wonderful, the characters cross over seamlessly, and no character is perfect. Just like no one in real life is perfect.\n\n\n\nClick here to buy\n\nI cannot rave about Station Eleven enough. I've recommended this book to anyone who\u2019s spoken to me in the past month. Regardless of whether or not you're anxious or depressed, just read this, and you\u2019ll thank me later. The book's post-pandemic world, in which 99 percent of the population has been wiped out and the remaining few are fighting for survival, is enthralling, thrilling, and utterly engrossing.\n\nThis book was the escape I\u2019d been looking for. Whenever I put it down (only for peeing, drinking, and eating), I felt at a loss, and had to wait a couple of moments to come to the realization that this is the real world, and I am not a survivor of the Georgia Flu.\n\n\n\nClick here to buy\n\nFey\u2019s book is wonderful for depression and anxiety, because she takes everything with a grain of salt and is able to laugh at herself. I\u2019ve often used sarcasm as a combat or a defense in some way, but not too much for my anxiety \u2014 although maybe now, I will. It\u2019s probably a healthier option than turning to pills.\n\n\n\nClick here to buy\n\nThe follow up to Less Than Zero, Imperial Bedrooms epitomizes hedonistic culture and makes it an art form. Most of what I like about Ellis is the fact that I am so different from his characters that the world he paints seems alien to me. At the time I read this book, I\u2019d been in my house for about three weeks, without moving off the couch for most of it. I escaped through these pages.\n\n\n\nClick here to buy\n\nBack to Yates. Like I said, he\u2019s my new favorite author. The Easter Parade is almost entirely about women (reading about men all the time can get a little claustrophobic) and it explains the problems they face without prettying them up. Characters in this book face real danger and enter institutions, and it knocked me on the head and reminded me, again, of how much we need other people. (I know, I know. I hate people too, but some people are OK, and they can help you.)\n\n\n\nClick here to buy\n\nFahrenheit 451 is legendary. The novel focuses on Guy Montag, a new kind of fireman: one who burns books, which are feared in his society. Reading this didn\u2019t necessarily help my anxiety, but it did remind me why I read \u2014 and why I was turning to books for comfort in the first place. I love books; smelling them, holding them, and reading them, of course.\n\n\n\nClick here to buy\n\nWarning: This book will make you cry. I thought I had a heart of stone until I read Flowers for Algernon. Damn you, Daniel Keyes. No matter what, protagonist Charlie can\u2019t connect to other people, leading him to ask, \u201cWhy am I always looking at life through a window?\u201d Reading that was that History Boys moment for me, where a book reaches out and grabs your hand in fellow feeling. Most of all, tracking Charlie Gordon\u2019s rise and fall resonates with my own recovery \u2014 mainly the fall, the worry of how far you\u2019ll plummet.\n\nUnlike Charlie, I believe your rock bottom will be just that: the bottom.

You stop, curse a bunch, and ask your friends for help. Now imagine one of them says, \u201cHey, can you just\u2026 not be in pain anymore? We\u2019re late for brunch and to be honest, your ankle is bumming the rest of us out.\u201d You\u2019d be pissed! You\u2019d say: \u201cShut up, Greg! Get me a freakin\u2019 ice pack RIGHT NOW, nobody wanted to invite you anyway!\u201d which may or may not be true but like, screw Greg.\n\nAs absurd as this sounds, we do it all the time to people struggling with anxiety. We\u2019ve all been Greg. We tell them to calm down like it\u2019s a helpful reminder, as if they had simply forgotten that not experiencing an elevated heart rate, nausea, and the crushing certainty that everything will end poorly was an option, as if not having a sprained ankle was an option.\n\nSo let\u2019s all agree, as a team, to just STOP telling people calm down, because anxiety is not a choice. We need to stop, because we sound like morons when we say it. We need to stop because the best case scenario is that the person you\u2019re talking to doesn\u2019t have an anxiety disorder, and is feeling super stressed out, and now they\u2019re making a mental note never to invite you to brunch again, Greg, because you\u2019ve being so monumentally unhelpful; the worst case scenario is that the person you\u2019re talking to does struggle with an anxiety disorder, and your garbage advice makes them feel both more anxious and ashamed to speak out about their experience.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not a huge stretch to believe the person you\u2019re talking to may be living with anxiety. According to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the U.S., affecting up to 18 percent of the adult population. These include generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), panic disorder, and social anxiety, among others. Telling someone who lives with one of these conditions to \u201ccalm down,\u201d is more than just unhelpful, it can actually increase their feelings of anxiety.\n\n\u201cFor some, hearing the words 'calm down' can actually trigger anxiety symptoms,\u201d Clarissa Silva, a Behavioral Scientist and author of the relationship blog \u201cYOU\u2019RE JUST A DUMBASS\u201d told Bustle. \u201cSimply telling someone to calm down doesn\u2019t reduce their symptoms, they will need tangible solutions to reduce their symptoms.\u201d\n\nInstead of trying to shut down a person\u2019s emotions, Silva suggests opening up a dialogue by saying something like: \u201cCan you tell me what upset you so much and let\u2019s talk about it.\u201d\n\nTelling someone to calm down is the opposite of opening up a dialogue \u2014 it shuts down any conversation about a person\u2019s feelings, including your own. Because when you tell someone to calm down, you\u2019re not saying \u201cI see you are suffering right now and I want to help you feel better,\u201d; what you\u2019re saying is \u201cI see you are suffering right now and I want you to feel better because your anxiety is making me uncomfortable.\u201d Telling someone to calm down is more about your feelings than it is about theirs.\n\nWhile conversations around mental health have opened up significantly in recent years, it is still difficult to discuss negative emotions in a society that overwhelmingly emphasizes displaying the best version of yourself to the public, and where vulnerability is often seen as a weakness. So when someone expresses their anxiety, those around them often don\u2019t know how to respond appropriately, because they are taken aback and/or limited by their own discomfort. Silva suggests social media also has a role to play in how we learn to respond to negative emotions by creating what she calls \u201cvanity validation\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re treating people like we do our social media streams. The shiniest object is what we stop at, then move onto the next shiny object. For many, they are only broadcasting and sharing the positive aspects of their lives on social media \u2014 the highlight reels. If we are mainly broadcasting the 'look at me,' are we able to deal with the negative aspects of life, rejection, detachment, and non-commitment? Are we creating a society that enables people becoming one-dimensional devices? Can we simply scroll or swipe away people\u2019s negative experiences?\u201d\n\nDealing with negative emotions is uncomfortable, of course it is. It would be great for everyone to be happy all the time! But negative emotions need to be dealt with out in the open, not suppressed and hidden away. That\u2019s literally the entire plot of Inside Out (and a number of academic studies). We need to stop telling people to calm down not only because it\u2019s a sh*tty, unhelpful, Greg thing to say, but because we need to move towards a culture where people can discuss their emotions, both positive and negative, openly and honestly.\n\nSo let's offer our friends emotional ice packs when they need them.\n\nDon\u2019t tell people to calm down.

My Fitbit journey began back in early 2014, when a fractured foot (that was as tiny as it was ridiculously annoying) forced me to stop running. In an effort to stay in shape, and because I am among the most hyper human beings on the planet, I walked everywhere, and optimistically thought that getting a Fitbit would help put my new fitness goals into perspective.\n\nOh, it did that, alright \u2014 and sooooo, so much more.\n\nI know a lot of people are convinced that Fitbits and other tracking devices are just a fad, but for some of us, they quickly became a religion: I started setting my alarm before the crack of dawn, rolling into DC for an internship two hours before I was supposed to get in, and spent my mornings manically jog-walking around monuments while trying not to make eye contact with other Fitbit slaves \u2014 er, I mean, users \u2014 for three straight months. I learned a lot about myself during those months, a lot of things that I should maybe not reveal for the sake of keeping up whatever illusion is left that I am not a full-fledged crazy person. But because I feel it is my public duty to warn all potential step-counters in this universe, I will tell you the struggles exactly as they truly are. This is what happens when you let a Fitbit into your life:\n\nFitbit Flex Wristband, $79.89, Amazon\n\nFitbit Charge Wristband, $99.93, Amazon\n\nYou live for the sole purpose of getting it to vibrate\n\nYou would think that there would a sexier reason for a woman to be so dependent on a vibrating machine, but waiting for that little buzz when you get to 10,000 steps and then goofily self-high-five-ing is perhaps the least glamorous moment of your day.\n\nYou get angry if you don't have it on when you walk\n\nIf you walk without wearing your Fitbit, does it even count as walking? I know there is no logic to this. I do know that. But on days when you happen to forget your Fitbit, you wonder why you even bothered getting out of bed in the first place. If Fitbit isn't counting them, are these steps even real? Is anything?\n\nExercise that doesn't involve stepping feels futile\n\nSURPRISE, Fitbit doesn't track all the fun exercise, like watching Netflix on the elliptical or swimming or doing what more ambitious humans call \"Pilates\". Yes, it may be good exercise for you, but is it good for Fitbit? Your priorities have never been wonkier.\n\nThis happy smile haunts your dreams\n\nLittle friend. We meet again.\n\nFitbit's validation becomes more important than the opinions of human beings\n\nIT LIKES ME. IT REALLY LIKES ME. Oh, whoa, did I get fired? It's cool, I got 11,000 steps today so I'm pretty much crushing it.\n\nYou check it more often than you check your email\n\nAnd to be clear, I check my email a lot. If my thumbs could talk, it would mostly be incoherent streams of tears.\n\nCharging it is nearly impossible\n\nBasically all you have to do is blow on it, stick it in the charger, squeeze it with your fingers, spin in a circle, pop-it, lock-it, polka dot-it, countrify, then hip hop it, and sacrifice your first born, annnnd you should be all set.\n\nIt is not as waterproof as it claims to be\n\nI wholeheartedly believed in its ability to withstand water pressure to certain depths until the first time I took it in the shower. RIP Fitbit (at least until they quickly sent a replacement).\n\nIt is unfashionable as all hell\n\nYeah, yeah, you can get the Tory Burch version \u2014 if you sell your liver for it first. The bracelet itself costs TWICE as much as the actual tracker.\n\nYou're constantly jumping up and down for seemingly no reason\n\nAnyone who has ever stood next to me in a crosswalk or a grocery store line was probably one shifty side eye away from calling to get me committed.\n\nYou have jumping marathons before you go to bed\n\nNothing is more unbearable than the idea of resting your head on a pillow when you're at 9,000 steps. Time to wake up all the neighbors!!!\n\nEveryone always thinks you're crazy and neurotic\n\nOwning a Fitbit is like waving a crazy flag.\n\nAnd they're RIGHT\n\nWE ARE CRAZY AND NEUROTIC. There. I said it. Some Fitbit users will try to lie to you and say they use it \"casually\" but there is no such thing. It owns our souls.\n\nFor some reason, you encourage your friends to join you\n\nI often feel like a Sith Lord luring friends into the darkness. What's worse is that I'm really, really good at it.\n\nYou're in a not-so-secret battle with friends and co-workers\n\nI once worked a few weeks in an office where everyone had a Fitbit, and that first weekend I went on a bender to get to 30,000 steps and crush the leading guys' high record. Because that's how you make new friends, right?\n\nNon Fitbit users 100% don't care about anything you have to say\n\nGONNA COMPLAIN AT YOU ANYWAY THOUGH.\n\nYour worst enemy is yourself\n\nThe problem with getting 30,000 steps in one day? The satisfaction is as fleeting as the satisfaction you get from sneezing. The instant you achieve something, you know that the only way you'll ever feel good about yourself again is by topping it, and there are only 24 hours in a day. Can we use all of them for stepping?? No. Will we try anyway?? CATCH ME IF YOU CAN.\n\nIf you stop using it, your Fitbit using friends will shun you\n\nAt first it's subtle. \"Wait, where's your Fitbit?\" they'll ask, because only a fellow addict would notice the faint tan line on your wrist where it used to be. And then, just like that, the bond that held you together is severed. You are no longer One Of Them.\n\nEven when you're done with it, you're never really done\n\nIt's always there. Glistening in the darkness. Calling to you in the light of day. It is waiting for the day you fall off the wagon of the trendy new exercise thing you were trying out, the day you fracture your running foot, the day you finally submit to its all-encompassing power and put it on once more. There is nowhere to run (but you might as well try, because you'll probably get a ton of steps doing it).\n\nImages: enjifit/Instagram; Getty Images; Giphy (9)", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/63730-19-very-real-and-emotional-struggles-of-having-a-fitbit-or-does-your-fitbit-have-you", "summary": "Something I learned very quickly about Fitbits: You do not own your Fitbit \u2014 your Fitbit owns you.\nYou get angry if you don't have it on when you walkIf you walk without wearing your Fitbit, does it even count as walking?\nYes, it may be good exercise for you, but is it good for Fitbit?\nWhat's worse is that I'm really, really good at it.\nIf you stop using it, your Fitbit using friends will shun youAt first it's subtle.", "timescraped": 1513838448.1820009, "category": {"words": 1093, "personal": 29, "thirdperson": 7, "condition": 0, "recovery": 0}}, "149716122274ad4e8cd85fd97e6f477c": {"title": "7 Ways Perfectionism Is Ruining Your Self-Esteem", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost%2F2016%2F9%2F13%2F713164c0-7e77-4053-9085-c84fe36b0f45.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "text": "The beautifully imperfect Anne Lamott, in her book Bird By Bird, says \"Perfectionism is the voice of the oppressor. The enemy of the people.\" Truer words have never been spoken. Perfectionism crushes your self-esteem, makes you suffer needlessly, affects your relationships with others, and pretty much just saps your enjoyment of life.\n\nAccording to Carolyn Gregoire in an article for the Huffington Post, perfectionism is highly associated with anxiety and depression. According to my medicine cabinet, and my massive spike of unfinished projects, this is true. On the surface, it doesn't seem like perfectionism would negatively impact self-esteem. I mean, perfectionists are typically pretty good at things. Maybe a lot of things. Many of them are super successful. So how could that translate to a hurricane of negative feels?\n\nBecause no one is perfect all the time. Eventually you're going to fail. Eventually your luck of being good at everything you try is going to run out. Eventually, you're going to disappoint someone or come in second. And by eventually, I mean, a lot. Perfectionists see these fails as deeply personal. As defining. As a statement about what the world thinks of them as people.\n\nPerfectionism is a self-fulfilling prophecy of low self-esteem. Here are some more reasons you need to get your perfectionism under control if you want to get your self-esteem in check.\n\n1. You Ignore Your Greatness\n\nIn your quest for perfection, you miss out on a lot of greatness. If you were able to reign it in and appreciate how much effort you put into things (usually way more than necessary and certainly way more than everyone else) you'd be awash in praise and happiness.\n\n2. You Hurt Your Relationships\n\nOne type of perfectionism, referred to as socially-prescribed perfectionism, causes you to believe that others have really high expectations for your behavior, according to Timothy A Pychyl Ph.D. in an article for Psych Central. Basically, your drive is fueled by the idea that no one thinks you're good enough. It's hard to have a healthy relationship with someone when you feel like a constant disappointment.\n\n\n\n3. You Forget What Defines You\n\nWhen you're wrapped up in perfectionism, it's easy to put too much stock in your job, your relationships, or how much money you have, according to mental health website Healthy Place. In reality, these are just parts of your life, but not what defines you.\n\n3. You Stack Up Half-Accomplishments\n\n\n\nPerfectionists have a bad habit of quitting before they get started, according to self-help website Personal Excellence. You never learn to play guitar because you suck at it when you start out. You give up on your nail art blog because there are others who are better than you. If you don't ever finish things, you miss the self-esteem boost associated with completing a task or finishing a goal.\n\n4. You Don't Accept Compliments\n\nMaybe you spend an hour trying to get your eyeliner wings even and they were still a little off. Sure, anyone you ran into would have to look really closely to even notice, but you know. And when someone tells you how your makeup is on fleek, you just go on about those dang wings. Perfectionists have trouble letting the praise flow into their inner self-esteem vaults because they have unrealistically high standards, according to About Health.\n\n5. You Struggle Needlessly\n\nYour all-or-nothing thinking and your hatred of being a beginner-level anything makes you worry about things you don't need to worry about. You're also less likely to ask for help or accept offers for help. Because you don't need help. Because you can do anything on the first try no matter what and make it great. Then you wonder why you struggle at things that seem to come so easily to others.\n\n6. You Compare Yourself To Others\n\nYour very first oil painting on your very first day of oil painting class wasn't a full-on Monet, so obviously you suck. As the Pinterest quote goes, you constantly compare your beginning to someone else's middle. This makes you feel like you suck. Or that you need to try harder. In reality, you just need practice and time.\n\n7. You Get Trapped\n\nSo you procrastinated a few times. Now you're obsessing over a project for work and school, and next thing you know, you're in a dirty house, surrounded by take out and you haven't showered in two days. And the project still isn't as good as you envisioned. And now, on top of feeling like a failure, you feel like a gross, dirty failure in a messy house who fails at adulting and projects. Sigh\n\nNever feeling like you're good enough and constantly striving to meet unrealistic expectations is pretty much the official recipe of low self-esteem.

Today's curated social media culture might make it seem like it's just you who's not living the dream, which is why we need to talk about Millennial women and depression. I'll let you in on a secret: You're not the only one who doesn't have it all figured out. One in five people ages 18 to 35 report being depressed, especially at work, with Millennial women being twice as likely to experience depression as men. So, why is the rate of depression so high among Millennial women?\n\n\"There is a generation of young women who seem overworked and underwhelmed,\" Los Angeles based Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist Michele Goldberg tells Bustle. \"They have adopted this notion that they must have a successful career in order to be valuable, falling into achievement addiction without questioning whether or not their pursuits are compatible with their values.\"\n\nAdditionally, New York City Psychotherapist Katherine Schafler said on her blog that the high unemployment rate for Millennials, coupled with crippling pressure to succeed, makes it hard to maintain a lifestyle that keeps depression at bay.\n\n\"The circular thoughts and feelings involved in choosing the right professional and personal trajectories create a vortex of anxiety that spirals you into an anti-climactic stuckness.\"\n\nWhile it might feel like everyone but you is busy \"having it all\" as you scroll through your Facebook feed, here are a few things to remember when it feels like you're failing at life.\n\nSocial Media Is Not Real Life\n\nDepending how old you are, you might not remember a time without the internet, cellphones, or social media. These technological advances have created a truly global society, which is good. They have also given a whole new meaning to the term \"keeping up with the Joneses,\" where failing is perceived as socio-economic or cultural inferiority, which is err, not so good.\n\n\"Instead of building a relationship with themselves, identifying and regulating their emotions, women are busy engaged in an indefinite conversation with thousands of other people,\" Goldberg says. \"Of course the highlight-reel phenomenon doesn't help.\"\n\nBefore our 24/7 digital culture, there was still a fair amount of posturing that went on as people presented the best version of themselves to their friends and neighbors. But, in today's social media maelstrom, this kind of posturing is pretty out of control, and even I am guilty of it.\n\nA few years ago I was traveling for work, and I posted a picture to Instagram of me and a friend having champagne on his stoop in New York City's West Village. One of my friends, whom I hadn't seen in a few years, commented that she envied my \"glamorous\" life. I instantly felt a twinge of sadness, because let me tell you that for every night I spent drinking Champagne on a stoop while globetrotting for my job, I spent 10 more battling major depression, and spiraling into a deep pit of despair. I once literally spent several hours crying in the bathroom at the airport in Paris because I missed my flight.\n\nI did not post that moment on social media, which offers a one-dimensional perspective, and it's a pretty safe bet that if you compare yourself to your \"friends\"online, you're definitely going to end up feeling like crap.\n\n\"The conversations [on social media] aren't wholly authentic, and they tend toward an artificially positive slant,\" Goldberg explains. \"The constant distraction social media provides is more dangerous than its false connection. Women are rarely present, rarely mindful of their thoughts, feelings, and body sensations, because they are busy focusing on someone else, something else, by consuming the unending supply of information that regenerates moment-to-moment on their Instagram and Facebook accounts.\"\n\nWorking 24/7 Isn't Good For You\n\nIn addition to always being on social media, women are over-committed at work, too. Schafler writes that the mixed messages Millennial women receive about \"having it all\" can result in an inevitable quarter life crisis.\n\n\"But there\u2019s no time to slow down when you can have it all (as Millennial women are constantly told),\" Schafler said on her blog, \"so it\u2019s understandable when so many young women respond to the immense amount of paradox pressure around them by constantly pushing themselves to get up and go, even if they\u2019re too dizzy to see the rabbit hole of depression right in front of them.\"\n\nGoldberg tells Bustle she has noticed that, when given the choice, Millennial women choose more work assignments for the sense of pride and purpose it affords them, and later to regret that they dedicated all of their time to work tasks when what they hunger for most is relationships and personal connections.\n\n\"Unfortunately, some women (not all) still hold onto the biological reality that time matters, and they secretly fear they are wasting their fertile years proving themselves in the workplace,\" she says. \"Having it all has become more of a pressure-filled mandate than an opportunity or choice.\"\n\nThis is a system that sets you up to fail, and U.S. News has tips for how to set boundaries at work so you don't burn out, and you can also have a real life.\n\nIt's OK To Ask For Help\n\nWhile the balanced dual-role life is something you may have envisioned as achievable, the burden of perfectionism you place on yourself in carrying it is often too heavy a weight to shoulder, Goldberg tells me.\n\n\"The energy it takes to perform at that level in both worlds is not exhilarating; it's exhausting,\" she says. \"Depleted women have a hard time forging ahead in their family lives when they already feel overextended in their work ones.\"\n\nA study from the University of Kansas used gender socialization theory to explain why women are suffering at higher rates than men. The study reported that \"Society puts certain expectations on people based on their gender from a very young age. ... Women experience significantly higher rates of role overload or feel that they are unable to complete their assigned duties in the work time allowed.\"\n\nI can relate. With the advent of the smartphone, I eventually found myself in a work situation where I would wake up at 6 a.m. in the throws of an anxiety attack several days a week at the mere thought of addressing the 200+ emails that flooded my inbox overnight. Coworkers contacted me at funerals to ask non-urgent questions. I literally felt like I was always working, and I had no life outside of my job.\n\nWhile I have struggled with depression all of my life \u2014 I hit a new low I was not sure I could recover from. However, I did bounce back; I left that job in favor of something I actually enjoy. It took a long time to get back to being myself, but I did it with the help of a support network. If you feel yourself slipping, it's OK to ask someone to help break your fall.\n\n\"You have to stop, challenge the social order, question whether your values are in alignment with your lifestyle, and own your own desires in life,\" Goldberg advises. \"If you want a family, you have to carve out time to date. And, in my practice, many young women feel guilty and reluctant doing so. It's a true bind. We're also farther apart from a community model of social organization than we ever have been, with the result that women feel in competition, adrift, and alone.\"\n\nTalking About It Makes You Feel Better\n\nIf you've been running on fumes, eventually you're going to run out of gas altogether.\n\n\"For many young women, the fall is fast, and the landing is anything but soft. Important life decisions are often made from this disoriented, rushed state, typically resulting in living a life that\u2019s not even close to an authentic reflection of who you are and what you want,\" Schafler said on her blog. \"This is about the right time for isolation to set in. Everyone on Facebook is looking happy, refreshed, recently promoted, and engaged, all while you\u2019re binge-watching Netflix and mindlessly snacking on a drug-store inspired menu of processed foods.\"\n\nCheck, check, check. I have watched all seven seasons of Gilmore Girls three times, sometimes while eating Taco Bell. I'm here to tell you that the struggle is real. Schafler added that the key to overcoming this cycle is to normalize the developmental challenges Millennial women face instead of ignoring they exist, and acknowledging that other factors like changes in hormones contribute to depression. By keeping these feelings to yourself you reinforce the notion that you're the only one suffering, and research shows that's simply not true.\n\n\"The twenties present a unique curriculum for learning about life, love, self-forgiveness, boundaries, empowerment, self-care and what it means to truly be healthy,\" Schafler said. \"Taking on these lessons alone is not what being independent is about. Whatever being at your best looks like for you, you deserve to be there.\"\n\nKeep Your Eyes On Your Own Paper\n\nOne thing Lauren Graham says in reference to comparing yourself to others, which has been immensely comforting to me, is \"keep your eyes on your own paper.\" This phrase from elementary school just might be the best advice out there for coping in today's over-connected world.\n\n\"I\u2019ve just gotten more peace out of worrying mainly about myself, and not getting too competitive or worried about other people\u2019s lives,\" Graham said in an interview with Main Line Today. \"I have a thing I say often, which I did not invent: 'Keep your eyes on your own paper.' And that\u2019s been very helpful to me.\"\n\nThis basically means that measuring your accomplishments against someone else's is not going to make you feel better (trust me, I've gone down this rabbit hole). You are an individual, and there is no magic time frame in which to achieve your life goals. Everyone is different, and that's OK.\n\nWhen perusing social media, remember that it's not real life, and most of those people are likely struggling too. If you are struggling, tell someone. You can even use an app to find a therapist. I know it's hard, but you can do it, because life is short, and you deserve to be happy \u2014 whatever that looks like for you.", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/p/we-need-to-talk-about-millennial-women-depression-48256", "summary": "Today's curated social media culture might make it seem like it's just you who's not living the dream, which is why we need to talk about Millennial women and depression.\nOne in five people ages 18 to 35 report being depressed, especially at work, with Millennial women being twice as likely to experience depression as men.\nSo, why is the rate of depression so high among Millennial women?\nSocial Media Is Not Real LifeDepending how old you are, you might not remember a time without the internet, cellphones, or social media.\nWorking 24/7 Isn't Good For YouIn addition to always being on social media, women are over-committed at work, too.", "timescraped": 1513838451.269015, "category": {"words": 1731, "personal": 36, "thirdperson": 32, "condition": 7, "recovery": 1}}, "96e52b150b851ebb4daae3e4aa3717a4": {"title": "'Inside Out,' Depression, Anxiety & What Happens When Fear Is The Dominant Emotion In Your Control Center", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost/2016/9/13/e024bcf6-66f1-4667-b858-55e080d621ca.jpg?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "text": "Pixar's latest film, Inside Out, is making waves not just for its monumental success but also because of its complexly layered, Aesopian-like tale that promotes emotional balance and self-acceptance. As a person who has dealt with mental health issues, it took me about two minutes of watching the film before I thought, \u201cOh, duh. Inside Out is about depression.\u201d And though, overtly, depression might not be the core topic, it's definitely a key issue.\n\nMark my words, anyone who has struggled with depression or other mental health issues will immediately relate to Sadness\u2019 reluctant but ironclad hold on Riley\u2019s brain. Though Joy is the head honcho in the teen's mind (the Justin Timberlake to Riley's band of emotions, if you will), in the end (spoiler alert), the unexpected main character in Riley\u2019s brain is Sadness.\n\nInside Out teaches us to embrace sadness, not repress it; to let Sadness take the center stage rather than trying to push her to the side or put her in a space where you don't have to deal with her. Sometimes the best way through the sadness is to dive right into it, the movie says, and once you allow yourself to accept those emotions, things might start to look up.\n\nBut what if the main character in your control center of a brain isn't Sadness? What if it's Fear that takes over and runs your emotional headquarters, his tyrannical reign leaving you a quivering shell of a person? Well, then you are probably like me, and while your head emotion may be different than Riley's, the themes of the film still hit close to home.\n\nWhen I was in my first year of grad school, I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). GAD is depression\u2019s best friend (or perhaps a close cousin) and they make for a doozy of an emotional roller coaster. I would generally consider myself a happy person, and I think that those around me would agree with that. In the months leading up to my diagnosis, though, the self that I knew was gone. In her place was a person unsettled.\n\nThe first time I had a panic attack, I didn\u2019t realize what was happening to me, but I knew something terrible was coming. I was sitting in a Starbucks and attempting to study (but I was actually journaling about my relationship with my long-term, long distance boyfriend). Things had been really, really rough lately, and I had started to feel like my whole life was crumbling into pieces around me. I was trying to get my relationship and my life sorted out, but was struggling.\n\nI sat in the crowded Starbucks and tried to hold back my tears as I typed on my keyboard when suddenly, I was hit with a cold wall of fear and panic, overcome with a sense of impending doom. I didn\u2019t know what was happening. I packed my backpack in a rush and dashed to my car. I drove the five minutes home, speeding the whole way. I felt like I was racing against the clock, running for my life. I don\u2019t know what was going on but I knew that something really, really wrong was happening.\n\nAs I pulled into the parking garage of my apartment, the tears came and huge sobs shook my body as I struggled to breathe. The walls were closing in and I had to get out. I sprinted down the hallways of my building, and when I eventually made it into my bedroom, I internally shattered into a billion pieces.\n\nImagine a baby pitching a temper tantrum, crying so hard he or she can\u2019t breathe, hyperventilating to the point of vomiting. Now imagine a 22-year-old girl having a reaction like that with absolutely no provocation. That's what I was like.\n\nI don\u2019t know how long I cried for but I know that I couldn\u2019t stop. I have a heart problem, and the adrenaline coursing through my body, coupled with my sobs and gasps for breath, meant that my heart rate spiked and then dropped, leaving me afraid that I would faint.\n\nThe pinnacle of what I would later learn was a panic attack (and not a heart attack, like I feared at the time) was when I experienced depersonalization. Depersonalization is a symptom that some with anxiety experience and it's a manifestation of panic where you switch out of a first-person perception of yourself into a more abstract, third-person understanding.\n\nYour reality no longer feels real. \"You\" as an entity, as a human, doesn't seem to exist anymore. Here I was, my physical body lying on my bed, sobbing, soaked with sweat and stained with tears, heart racing, head spinning. But the \"me\" that thinks and feels felt as if it was outside my body, floating above it. A tiny voice in my head saw this broken, withering husk of a human that it looked down on and registered that something was off. This didn't make sense: why was my body acting like this? Why did I feel separate from my physical self? I don't know how much time passed before I started to feel like I was me, Chelsea, in my own body again, which I could control.\n\nLearning to cope with my anxiety has been an ongoing process of self-discovery. It's taken me several more panic attacks, nearly a year of therapy, and dozens of terrible days to understand my anxiety. When my anxiety was at its worst, fear would course through my body at the tiniest provocation. Anything related to my relationships, bills, school, you name it: my stomach would drop with worry. I would feel so out of control I would have the urge to make myself vomit so I could feel in control of something. I got stuck in a cycle of fear and anxiety, hysteria, sadness, guilt for being so difficult, and then more sadness because I felt so alone.\n\nI still have bad days and I know I will have periods where things will get out of hand again. I'm in a time of life categorized by change and chaos. Every new element of my life that I experience, I experience with hesitation and a bit of terror. I'm wary of my own reactions because they're so unpredictable. It's unsettling, feeling like you are a ticking timebomb and that anything unexpected might send you into a downward spiral of panic.\n\nBut Inside Out gets it. I was floored when I saw it, because the concept of the film so poignantly captured exactly how I\u2019d felt when my anxiety was at its worst. I felt like I was an agent-less subject, subservient to the whims of my emotions just as Riley was totally obedient to whichever emotion was taking over the controls in her brain at the time.\n\nInside Out spoke to me, understood me. Riley's struggle (however unconscious it might have been) to fight against the sadness she felt was a battle I'd fought myself. Her struggle was my struggle; the disconnect between her emotions and ability to control them is something I still have a difficult time dealing with.\n\nYet while Sadness was Riley's demon, Fear is mine. Too much fear all at once, too much pushback against that fear. Sometimes it's hard to separate myself from the anxiety. It clearly complicates and problematizes my thought process, but I\u2019m afraid of using anxiety as a scapegoat for bad behavior. Are my irrational emotions a by-product of all this, or is it unfair to blame everything I do on my disorder? I honestly don\u2019t know.\n\nWhat Inside Out taught me \u2014 what I've been struggling to realize \u2014 is that I am not my anxiety. I am not my sadness. And I am not my fear. Yes, I am culpable for my actions and my behavior, but I have to remind myself that I'm just wired a bit differently. There's the me that worries incessantly and goes cold with panic at inappropriate times, and there's nothing I can do to change that. But I can hover above it, observe the emotions, let them happen, and wait out the storm until I can sink back into myself with a better understanding of who I am and why I work the way I do.\n\nEvery day is a surprise. The future still scares me. I still feel crippling fear when the first of the month approaches and it's time to pay rent. My anxiety comes and goes like the weather. I just wake up and have to see what it's going to do today and weather that storm. Before, I felt weak, and even the smallest disruption threatened to destroy me. But I'm older, wiser, and better equipped to handle my own subconscious, and comforted in knowing that others get what I've experienced. Most importantly? I know that my brain can't dish out anything I can't handle.\n\nImages: Walt Disney Studios; Giphy (4)", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/93382-inside-out-depression-anxiety-what-happens-when-fear-is-the-dominant-emotion-in-your-control", "summary": "Inside Out is about depression.\u201d And though, overtly, depression might not be the core topic, it's definitely a key issue.\nWhen I was in my first year of grad school, I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD).\nWhen my anxiety was at its worst, fear would course through my body at the tiniest provocation.\nI got stuck in a cycle of fear and anxiety, hysteria, sadness, guilt for being so difficult, and then more sadness because I felt so alone.\nI still feel crippling fear when the first of the month approaches and it's time to pay rent.", "timescraped": 1513838430.20715, "category": {"words": 1504, "personal": 89, "thirdperson": 14, "condition": 11, "recovery": 0}}, "835a07b0be379cebc36145597e42b8c4": {"title": "3 Ways To Explain Your Anxiety To Someone Who Doesn't Get It", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost%2F2016%2F11%2F10%2Fbfd102e9-a608-4229-8257-0e318b2bf9f3.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "text": "I don't usually think of myself as a \"person with anxiety disorder,\" which is funny, since a pretty solid chunk of my day is governed by the fact that I am a person with anxiety disorder. Anxiety can turn something as simple as my morning commute into a psychological game show, where I'm constantly trying to figure out the correct answer before the timer runs out. Do I stuff myself onto this extremely crowded train and potentially freak out, or do I wait for the next one and risk being late to work? Do I stress out about making small talk with my barista, or do I walk 10 minutes out of my way to a new coffee shop where nobody knows me? Oops, you chose wrong, and now you're having a panic attack! But thank you for playing \"Generalized Anxiety Disorder\"! If you also deal with anxiety, you may be nodding your head to all that; but if you don't, you may just be scratching it. Because it is exceedingly tough to explain anxiety to someone who hasn't dealt with it.\n\n\n\nThose of us with anxiety issues are lucky to live in an era of increased awareness \u2014 in previous decades, anxiety was often dismissed as \"shyness\" or treated as a personality flaw that you could be talked out of. But even though many people now understand that anxiety is a real mental health disorder, they may still struggle to understand what anxiety feels like, or why it makes certain aspects of life more complicated. So below, I've shared three ways that I personally have explained my anxiety to others. I'm not a therapist; these are just some tactics that have worked for me. But maybe they will inspire you to find new ways to explain to your own experience with anxiety to your loved ones.\n\n\n\n1. Compare It To An Experience They're Familiar With\n\n\n\nA lot of people who've never experienced anxiety imagine that it must be similar to what they felt before they gave a big presentation at work, or asked someone they really liked out on a date. And it might be a little like that, at times \u2014 but I feel like anxiety that you feel because you took a risk that might pay off later is different from the anxiety I experience on the regular. So I find that it's helpful to explain anxiety in terms of a different kind of nerve-wracking experience that they may be familiar with.\n\n\n\nTo me, anxiety feels like being in a big, creepy house alone at night (you can also substitute \"driving alone on a deserted highway\" or \"lost in a city where you don't speak the language\" if you love creepy houses at night). You hear a noise that wouldn't cause any real reaction if you heard it during the day at work \u2014 but hearing it alone in this big scary house makes your heart race and your body prepare for fight-or-flight. You become extra sensitive to everything else around you \u2014 sights, smells, whatever \u2014 because your body is trying to figure out if you're threatened. I've found that explaining it in this way helps me better convey the emotionally-charged nature of my anxiety \u2014 and its trajectory, which is less \"rise to a peak and then experience relief at the end\" and more \"get freaked out over and over again by the weird creaking noises until you eventually fall asleep.\"\n\n\n\n2. Explain How It Impacts The Small Things You Do Each Day\n\n\n\nPeople who don't grapple with anxiety can have a hard time understanding how it complicates the small things you have to do every day, so I find that walking them through a specific situation that gives me anxiety, step by step, can be illuminating.\n\n\n\nFor me, email is an issue. A lot of my anxieties focus on social interactions, be they in person or online, with strangers or people I know well. And all these anxieties come to a head when I have to write a group email to, say, a group of coworkers whom I don't know too well.\n\n\n\nFirst, I write out the email, spellcheck it, all the normal stuff. Then I go through to make sure I didn't use any words that I don't totally know the meaning of, just in case I used them incorrectly, which I'm afraid would make my coworkers think I'm stupid. Then I go through again, word by word, and take out anything I could imagine anyone possibly misconstruing and getting offended by. Then I try to think of whether any of the ideas I brought up in the email could possibly be interpreted as stepping on anyone else's toes, and I take those out, too. Then I go through again and try to find anything in the email that could be annoying that I somehow missed the first time. Then I walk away from my computer for 15 minutes and imagine all my coworkers getting the email, and becoming offended or annoyed with me anyway. Eventually, I send the email.\n\n\n\nI've found that this kind of blow-by-blow explanation can be more effective than a hundred metaphors, as it actually helps the person you're talking to see how anxiety shapes your decisions and thought processes\n\n\n\n3. Let Them Know That You Don't Always Know What Will Make You Anxious\n\n\n\nEven the most sensitive friends and family members may sometimes get confused or frustrated with the seemingly random nature of anxiety. They assume that there's a more direct cause-and-effect action at work; Action A causes you to feel Emotion B. That's why I find that it can be helpful to be open and frank about the fact that my anxiety is kind of unpredictable.\n\nMy boyfriend, for example, is an absolute champion at helping me cope (and coping himself) with my anxiety. He soothes, he unconditionally supports, he does that thing where you tell someone to visualize their body being enveloped in a calming white light. He is the MVP of my GAD. But even he is sometimes perplexed by it. For example, most Sunday nights, I get panicky. If I don't go on an exhausting jog during the day and then write in my diary (and sometimes even if I do those things), I am in for a long night of insomnia. Insomnia is one of the main ways my anxiety manifests itself \u2014 I wake up after an hour or so of sleep with my heart pounding, and find that my brain wide awake and full of every spare worry floating around my head.\n\n\n\nOnce, when my boyfriend happened to be up during one of these insomniac episodes, he started asking me what I was worried about. \"Nothing,\" I told him, and I was telling him the truth \u2014 sometimes these insomnia episodes were tied to actual worries about my job or friends, but sometimes they weren't. Sometimes they seemed to appear in the grooves worn by old worries \u2014 I had developed the Sunday night insomnia habit at my old job, where every Monday was a fresh hell, but changing careers hadn't helped me shake it.\n\n\n\nAnd sometimes, I had a night of insomnia for no discernable reason \u2014 the same way that some days, I can chat with whoever, and others I can barely deal with the thought of having to make small talk with our neighbors in our apartment's vestibule. My anxiety isn't rational \u2014 it's not just an amplified expression of what I'm worried about. It's a misfiring of my brain's fight-or-flight mechanisms, and while I can deploy a ton of coping methods when it flares up, I'm not in charge of what sets it off. I can't always see it coming \u2014 I often don't know I'm having a bad anxiety episode until I'm already deeply freaking out.\n\n\n\nAnd even the people who love us the most, and are around us day after day, may not realize this on their own. They may be looking for patterns in what sets us off \u2014 which can be helpful. But they may not understand that there isn't always a rhyme or reason to having a panic attack or an episode of extreme anxiety. Sometimes it just happens.\n\n\n\nThese are just my own experiences with my own anxiety, of course. Yours may be (and probably are) completely different. But if you've been having trouble explaining your own anxiety experiences and symptoms to others, maybe some of these descriptions can give you a jumping off point. The people who care us want to understand, even if they don't necessarily get it right away. But don't give up. They'll get there, eventually.\n\n\n\nImages: Volkan Olmez/ Unsplash; Giphy (3)\n\n", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/116771-3-ways-to-explain-your-anxiety-to-someone-who-doesnt-get-it", "summary": "Because it is exceedingly tough to explain anxiety to someone who hasn't dealt with it.\nSo below, I've shared three ways that I personally have explained my anxiety to others.\nBut maybe they will inspire you to find new ways to explain to your own experience with anxiety to your loved ones.\nSo I find that it's helpful to explain anxiety in terms of a different kind of nerve-wracking experience that they may be familiar with.\nI can't always see it coming \u2014 I often don't know I'm having a bad anxiety episode until I'm already deeply freaking out.", "timescraped": 1513838431.457373, "category": {"words": 1483, "personal": 67, "thirdperson": 26, "condition": 25, "recovery": 0}}, "c8ef5c96ba3dded6229e4e447fe74ed3": {"title": "7 Activities That Could Be Making Your Anxiety Worse", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost%2F2016%2F9%2F13%2F187a71e5-fe8a-4956-a37c-1a2bdd0381e3.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "text": "Like about 18 percent of the U.S. population, I have an anxiety disorder. And, like a fair share of similarly afflicted folks, I often treat my anxiety disorder as a bit of an afterthought, even though in many ways, it is the axis around which my days revolve. I don't often think about whether engaging in certain activities will cause my anxiety to flare up, consider whether certain foods will make my mood worse, or examine my daily schedule to make sure it has as few anxiety triggers as possible \u2014 and I often pay for it, in lost sleep, racing thoughts, and agonized paranoia about whether all of my friends now think I'm an idiot because I used the wrong \"their\" in a group email.\n\nThough many of us anxious folks spend a lot of time avoiding situations that consciously make us feel anxious, like attending parties or speaking up at business meetings, we probably don't spend a lot of time avoiding the small things that ratchet up our anxiety \u2014 which is a mistake. Avoiding the things we fear \u2014 known as \"avoidance\" \u2014 can actually make our anxiety worse, as it often isolates us from friends or keeps us from achieving goals or connecting with others in the ways that we want. On the flip side, practicing self-care by limiting our time in situations or engaging in activities that have been proven to increase anxiety can make a real difference in your quality of life. Especially since many of the coping mechanisms that we develop on our own (like drinking booze to take the edge off) can end up making us more anxious in the end.\n\nI say this not to shame anyone (including myself) for not being perfect, or to claim that that self-care is a cure-all for anxiety or anything else; even folks practicing self-care techniques to the letter will still have bad days. Rather, consider this a reminder that the difference between feeling completely worn down by a mental health issue like anxiety and feeling like you can deal with another day often lies in practicing self-care \u2014 and that taking care of yourself is not as difficult or intimidating as it might initially seem.\n\n1. Drinking\n\n\"People drink to cope with anxiety\" is up there with \"the sky is blue\" and \"no movie requires a third sequel\" in the realm of obvious facts \u2014 but that doesn't make it a good idea. Obviously, in the short term, a drink can help you feel less anxious; alcohol is a sedative and a depressant, so it relaxes your muscles and depresses functions of your central nervous system. But even a few drinks can disrupt your sleep and cause rises and dips in your blood sugar \u2014 all things that can bring on anxiety. Alcohol can also mess with your brain's serotonin levels, which can sometimes make you feel more anxious and depressed than you were to begin with, after you eventually sober up.\n\nAnd in the long term, folks with anxiety \u2014 especially social anxiety \u2014 should pay special attention to how much they imbibe, because we're often more vulnerable to developing a troubled relationship with booze. According to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, 20 percent of people dealing with social anxiety disorder also struggle with alcohol dependence or other addiction issues.\n\nThis isn't all to say that if you've been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, you are doomed to spend the rest of your life sipping seltzer at happy hour; but staying aware of your limits and how much you're drinking can help you keep your mood level and your anxiety down.\n\n2. Skipping Meals\n\nMost of us accidentally skip meals now and then, due to hectic work schedules, travel, or simply being so absorbed in an important project/Facebook that we lose track of the time. And though no one should be intentionally skipping meals (seriously \u2014 it will make it difficult for you to think and it slows your metabolism, among other drawbacks), anxious people should be extra sure to steer clear of this habit \u2014 skipping a meal can lead to a drop in blood sugar, which can lead to a rise in anxiety.\n\n3. Spending Too Much Time On Social Media\n\nOK, this one shouldn't come as a surprise to ... well, literally anyone who has ever been near a computer. But it's easy to forget, especially when you find yourself accidentally getting sucked into Hour 3 of clicking around the profiles of people you haven't spoken to since high school (because, you know, you didn't actually like them in high school). A 2012 study of UK social media users found that two-thirds of those surveyed had trouble sleeping after using social media, and the British Psychological Society found that among teenagers, heavy use of social media was linked to higher levels of anxiety, as well as lower levels of self-esteem.\n\nIf you catch yourself scrolling through pictures of someone else's kids and cats in a daze, try getting up and going for a walk or otherwise taking a break from technology.\n\n4. Not Drinking Enough Water\n\nIt's really easy to consume beverages all day and still not drink enough water \u2014 tons of common drinks like soda, tea, coffee, and alcohol actually actively dehydrate us (and caffeine can aggravate anxiety on its own, no matter how hydrated you are). But even if you're steering clear of drinks that actively dehydrate you, you may still not be getting enough water \u2014 which can be enough to mess with your anxiety levels. According to the Mayo Clinic's website, \"Even mild dehydration can affect your mood,\" a statement that was borne out by a 2009 study conducted at Tufts University, which found that being mildly dehydrated caused subjects to feel \"angry, confused, tense and fatigued.\"\n\nSo how much water do you actually need? The Mayo Clinic recommends nine cups of non-dehydrating beverages a day for adult women; though the amount of exercise you engage in each day, as well as your environment, and any illnesses you're currently dealing with, can impact the total amount you should be consuming.\n\n\n\n5. Not Getting Enough Sleep\n\nLike skipping meals, under-sleeping is kind of ill of modern life \u2014 with demanding job or school schedules, sometimes it feels like the only way to see your friends or unwind at all is to cut into your sleep. But the danger that lack of sleep presents for the anxious is two-fold: according to researchers at UC Berkeley, \"sleep deprivation amplifies anticipatory anxiety by firing up the brain\u2019s amygdala and insular cortex, regions associated with emotional processing...Furthermore, their research suggests that innate worriers \u2014 those who are naturally more anxious and therefore more likely to develop a full-blown anxiety disorder \u2014 are acutely vulnerable to the impact of insufficient sleep.\"\n\nSo, basically: lack of sleep will make anyone feel anxious, and if you're already anxious, lack of sleep will make it even worse.\n\n\n\n6. Sitting All Day\n\nIn addition to all the health hazards of sitting all day that you have probably heard about already \u2014 back problems! Increased risk of death from cardiovascular ailments! \u2014 some research suggest that a sedentary lifestyle may increase our anxiety symptoms, while regular movement and exercise can help tone them down. Luckily, the same solution works to deal with all of these threats \u2014 stand for 10 minutes each hour, and you can mitigate many of the negative effects of sitting.\n\n\n\n7. Shallow Breathing\n\nThis one is something of a catch-22: experiencing shallow breathing, caused by problems like asthma or poor air quality, can often make people feel more anxious. What's another thing that causes shallow breathing? A panic attack! This can create a sort of ouroboros of anxiety for sufferers \u2014 you can't breathe, so you panic, which makes it even harder for you to breathe, which makes you panic more. Some panic attacks are actually triggered by feeling short of breath, and then lead to further shallow breathing, which can make the attack worse.\n\nOf course, you're not always in charge of when your breathing will become shallow (say, if you have breathing difficulties); but if you find that you begin breathing shallowly when you become anxious, doctors recommend techniques like breathing through your nose and breathing \"into\" your abdomen. Having a meditation practice can also help you become more aware of your breath in general.\n\nOf course, no one's perfect, so don't get mad or feel depressed if you find it's hard to put these ideas into practice in your own life; being gentle with yourself about self-care can be almost as important as the self-care itself. But remember that these techniques are out there, and it can't hurt to give them a try. You have nothing to lose but your panic attacks, right?\n\nWant more women's health coverage?

Oh, and it's Father's Day, too. According to the National Fatherhood Initiative, a highly involved father has a great positive impact on a child\u2019s life, and research shows that more father-child contact within the first 10 years lead to kids with fewer behavioral problems and high marks on reading achievement tests.\n\nBeing a mother is tough. There\u2019s no question about it. But make no mistake, being a father isn\u2019t an easy breezy walk in the park, either. According to Ask Men, being a good father entails being an open-minded disciplinarian who leads by example, allows his kids to make mistakes, challenges them, spends time with them, protects them, and shows them unconditional love.\n\nA lot of research has been done surrounding mothers and their experiences from pregnancy to raising their children. It does makes sense, after all, mothers do have to deal with the whole growing-a-tiny-human-inside-of-themselves thing for nine months. But every now and then, a study will come out to give us better insight into fatherhood and its importance.\n\nHere are 15 things to know about being a father, according to science:\n\n1. We're More Like Our Dads \u2014 Genetically Speaking\n\n[Embed]\n\nA study done at the University of North Carolina found that in terms of genetic makeup, mammals are more like their fathers than their mothers. Even though we get the same amount of genetic mutations from our parents, we actually use more of the DNA we get from our dads. Knowing this information can help in the study of diseases. For example, the severity of a disease can be different if passed down from the mother or the father.\n\n\n\n2. What To Expect When You're Expecting: Hormone Changes! For Both Moms And Dads\n\n\n\n[Embed]\n\nObviously women go through a lot of hormone changes when they're expecting, but in a study of 29 first-time parents done by researchers at the University of Michigan found that expectant fathers showed drops in testosterone and estradiol, which is a form of estrogen. The hormone changes occur in the early stages of pregnancy. Researchers believe the changes occur due to a process happening within a man by just thinking of becoming a father. The study further found that men with larger declines in testosterone reported to being more engaged with their babies and even more supportive of their spouses.\n\n\n\n3. Dads Need To Seriously Work On Their Baby Talk\n\n[Embed]\n\nMothers are known for having soothing voices that can immediately put their child at ease. Scientists have even declared that mothers have mastered the art of \"motherese,\" or that tweak in pitch and pace that a mother uses when she talks to her young child. Fathers, on the other hand, have a lot of work to do do in that area. A recent study done by researchers at Washington State University looked at 11 preschoolers around 30-months-old and recorded over 150 hours of audio to find their results. The study found that dads' voices tend to stay steady when they're talking to their children, and they pretty much talk to their kids like they talk to adults. But as speech scientist and the study's coauthor Mark VanDam pointed out, that's not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, in doing so, dads are actually giving their young kids a sort of \"conversational bridge\" to the outside world.\n\n4. Dads, Too, Feel Guilty When They Leave Their Kids\n\n\n\n[Embed]\n\nIf you think new moms are the only ones who feel guilty leaving their kids for even a short time, you'd be wrong. In a 2014 study of working mothers and fathers in focus groups by researchers at Kansas State University, it was found that men have to deal with their feelings when it comes to balancing family and fitness.\n\n\n\nEmily Mailey, an assistant professor of kinesiology in the College of Human Ecology and researcher said,\n\nA decline or lack of exercise among working parents has mostly been recognized as a female issue. The ethic of care theory \u2014 that females have been socialized to meet everyone else's needs before their own \u2014 explains why women feel guilty when they take time to exercise, though the same principle hasn't been studied for fathers. ...The guilt parents feel is because they think of exercise as a selfish behavior. Fathers reported guilt related to family and taking time for themselves, whereas mothers reported guilt related to family, taking time for themselves and work.\n\nAccording to Mailey's research, fathers reported to taking time during lunch for exercise or working out during the day in order to spend more time with their family and kids after work.\n\n5. Dads Need To Work On Their Fair Share Of Housework\n\n[Embed]\n\nIn sticking to stereotypes, an Ohio State study found that pre-baby, working men and women shared the housework equally, but once the first child pops out, fathers tend to take a step back on chore duties. According to the study of 182 working couples who became first-time parents, the women spent an hour more at home each day than their husbands did. During the first weeks of parenthood, men actually cut back on their household duties by five hours per week. Speaking of chores...\n\n\n\n6. Dads Who Do More Chores Have Daughters With High Aspirations\n\n[Embed]\n\nIn a 2014 study published in Psychological Science, it was found that parents' domestic actions spoke louder than words. As in, even though a father preached all things feminism, if he left all the household duties to his wide, as \"traditional\" families tend to do, daughters will remember that and tend to envision themselves in traditionally female-dominant jobs. Researchers looked at 326 children aged 7 to 13-years-old and at least one of their involved parents. It was found that fathers who were found to help with household chores had daughters who aspired for less traditional and higher paying careers. So do as John Mayer says: Fathers, be good to your daughters, and wash a dish or two.\n\n\n\n7. The Struggle Is Real For New Dads, Too\n\n[Embed]\n\nA study done by a UK charity for parents, NCT, found that a third of dads struggle with the mental pressures of being a new father, leading researchers to recognize that postnatal depression and perinatal mental health issues can happen to not only women but men as well. It was even found that men who support women with postpartum depression are likely to experience it themselves.\n\n\n\n8. \"Deadbeat Dads\" May Not Be What They Seem\n\n[Embed]\n\nSometimes, things between a mother and a father don't work out. Sometimes, both parents share the responsibilities of raising the kids even though they're separated. Sometimes, it's just solely the mother or the father. But nobody thinks it's cool for a guy to abandon all responsibilities of being a father. In fact, as TIME reports, in 2011, only 61 percent of child support payments were made by men to mothers of their children. But a recent study published in the Journal of Marriage and Family took a look at 367 lower income fathers and found that fathers who don't pay for child support in cash contribute to their children's lives in a different way. Instead, almost half of the fathers in the study provided their children with baby products, clothes, school expenses, and food. Researchers found that those fathers contribute around $60 a month per child, which doesn't show up on statistics. They believe that dads prefer to give their kids stuff, rather than hand cash over to the moms, because the fathers get more recognition from their children.\n\n\n\n9. One Way To Show You're A Good Father? Sing!\n\nResearchers from the Freie Universitat in Berlin found that male nightingales prove their family values through song. It was found that the better the singing, the more supportive and protective the male would be towards their family.\n\n\n\n10. For Some Men, Starting A Family Can Increase A Man's Salary, Productivity Level, And Loyalty To His Company\n\n[Embed]\n\nA 2008 study conducted at the University of New Hampshire found that for married white and Latino men, the birth of a child brought an increase in annual earnings and time spent at work. It was even found that they earned more if their wives opted for the more traditional route and worked less. However, for married black men, the birth of a child was associated with a smaller increase in hourly wages and annual earnings.\n\n\n\n11. The Best State For Working Dads Is Minnesota. The Worst? Mississippi.\n\n[Embed]\n\nA survey conducted by WalletHub analyzed 20 key areas including work-life balance, health conditions, financial well-being, male life expectancy, and child raising environments, among others to rank the best and worst states for working dads. The top five states for working dads are New Jersey, Vermont, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Minnesota at the top. At the bottom of the list are Louisiana, West Virginia, Arkansas, Nevada, and Mississippi.\n\n\n\n12. You Can Thank All That Time Spent With Dad For Your Lack Of STDs In College\n\n[Embed]\n\nResearch done at the University of Florida found that female students who said their dads were more involved in their lives as teens were more likely to practice safe sex in college. The researchers surveyed 748 college students in an introductory course at a large public southeastern university, where 60 percent of the population was female. Those who reported that their fathers were actively present in their lives used condoms more frequently, had sex less frequently, and with fewer partners. Researchers believe that it has something to do with male attention. If a father figure is present in a girl's adolescent life, she doesn't need to actively seek male attention outside of the home.\n\n\n\n13. Fathers Who Actively Raise Their Children Make Smarter And Better Behaved Children\n\n[Embed]\n\nIn a study published in the Canadian Journal of Behavioural Science, fathers positively influence the development of their children though hands-on parenting. Having a father present in a child's life was found to have a positive influence on a child's problem-solving abilities and a decrease in emotional problems such as sadness, social withdrawal, and anxiety. Furthermore, an absentee dad was actually found to be worse for girls. It was found that middle school girls with absent fathers experienced higher levels of emotional problems at school than other girls whose fathers were present in their lives.\n\n\n\n14. Dads Who Play With Their Children Help Them Develop Better\n\n[Embed]\n\nIn research done by Kathryn Kerns, a professor of psychological sciences at Kent State University in Ohio, she found that a child's ability to form close, trusting bonds with their parents early on in life could predict the quality of a child's social future when it came to friends and romance. It was found that fathers who play with their children in a goofy and teasing way helped strengthen their bond with their child, which in turn, helped the child develop. It was also found that little gestures here and there, such as a father leaning down to nuzzle his baby's neck with his chin, were found to be signs of encouragement for a frustrated child.\n\n\n\n15. Dads Who Spend More Time With Their Kids Are Happier Overall\n\n[Embed]\n\nIn a study published earlier this year in the Academy of Management Perspectives, researchers took responses from 31 fathers with young children to answer a series of questions about their thoughts on career and fatherhood. It was found that working dads who spent more time with their kids were more satisfied with their jobs and experienced less conflicts in their home, finding that perfect work-life balance.\n\n\n\nSince Father\u2019s Day is just around the corner, it\u2019s nice to take the time out to appreciate all the great dads out there \u2014 mine included! \u2014 and thank them for everything they do.\n\nImages: Pexels; Getty/Giphy(15)", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/91355-15-fascinating-facts-about-fathers-according-to-science-because-you-may-be-more-like-your-dad", "summary": "But every now and then, a study will come out to give us better insight into fatherhood and its importance.\nHere are 15 things to know about being a father, according to science:1.\nResearchers believe the changes occur due to a process happening within a man by just thinking of becoming a father.\nInstead, almost half of the fathers in the study provided their children with baby products, clothes, school expenses, and food.\nResearchers found that those fathers contribute around $60 a month per child, which doesn't show up on statistics.", "timescraped": 1513838434.335386, "category": {"words": 1988, "personal": 9, "thirdperson": 74, "condition": 4, "recovery": 0}}, "f051383da50300f1fb2cb691554a1960": {"title": "11 Things You Didn't Know About Redheads \u2014 Because The Ginger Struggle Is Real", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost%2F2016%2F9%2F13%2F99ebfc5e-cb56-4d94-a0c2-4a211c8e64ac.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "text": "proper redhead because my sister Sarah's locks are undoubtably redder than mine (her friends fondly call her Red \u2014 but not in like, an Orange is the New Black kind of way). That being said, people who know me and not my sister consider me to be pure ginger. And either way, I am aware of a certain amount of discrimination against us, which makes my mind boggle just as equally as any other discrimination.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Facebook event page for National Hug A Ginger Day: Do redheads come from another planet? Do they have super powers? These aren't uncommon questions thrown around at the ginger community, so I decided to read up on our flame-haired friends and let you in on a few scientific secrets about these mysterious people. I have never considered myself aredhead because my sister Sarah's locks are undoubtably redder than mine (her friends fondly call her\u2014 but not in like, ankind of way). That being said, people who know me andmy sister consider me to be pure ginger. And either way, I am aware of a certain amount of discrimination against us, which makes my mind boggle just as equally as any other discrimination.According to the Facebook event page for National Hug A Ginger Day:\n\n\"In 2008, a Facebook group was made in Canada entitled 'Kick a Ginger Day.' The inspiration for the group came from an episode in South Park called 'Ginger Kids.' Thousands of redheads were kicked, hundreds of arrests were made. A brave redhead took over the group, and changed the name to 'National Hug a Ginger Day.' There is talk of 'gingerism' being the latest form of accepted discrimination. On February 22nd, hug a ginger. Stop the discrimination. Be happy... and eat good food.\"\n\n\n\nThere are several projects such as this one in existence at the moment. In Breda in The Netherlands they celebrate Redhead Day, with more than 5000 gingers taking over the city for a two-day festival. Other projects surrounding redheaded-ness cause me to furrow my brow somewhat, but here you can find a list of great things that redheads have achieved in the world and why they are awesome. I get a bit uncomfortable if someone starts to explain why people with one physical trait are better than others. However, there are some scientifically proven things that our red-haired buddies have that we don't. So I've collected a few interesting facts for you:\n\n1. Redheads Don't Turn Into Vampires When They Die\n\nI know, I know. We all thought this one was true for sure, because how else can you explain redheads' extreme aversion of the sun? Deathly pale skin and blood red hair coloring? Most of you will have heard this scientific theory on South Park, but the initial idea came from Ancient Greece.\n\n2. They Haven't Had It Easy\n\nRedheads have also been accused of being evil gods, devils and witches. The list of haters includes Ancient Egyptians, Romans and Greeks, Aristotle, Hitler, the media \u2014 and it goes on and on. I'm not sure where this comes from, but I'm guessing it's a minority thing? So be nice next time you're talking to a redhead; maybe even give them a hug. That would make the world a better place, considering hugs are the best.\n\n\n\n3. Technically They Are Mutants\n\nThe gene that causes red hair (which is recessive) comes from the MC1R \u2014 which is a genetic mutation. Movies have lead me to believe that this also means that redheads have hidden mutant super powers, right?\n\n4. Mutant Superpower No. 2: Left Handedness\n\nMutant genes apparently like to hang out together, so if you have red hair you are more likely to be left handed. My sister is left handed and has red hair \u2014 double mutant! (I wonder if she has any special powers?)\n\n\n\n5. Redheads Are More Sensitive To Temperature\n\nNow I have the perfect answer next time one of my colleagues asks me why I still have my coat on two hours after arriving at work. It's because of my hair color, obviously! I can't stand the cold \u2014 it kills me \u2014 and I go to great lengths to keep myself protected from the cold. I can also confirm problems with the other end of the temperature scale, because I can't handle being too warm. No cosy spooning in front of the fireplace for me!\n\n6. They Never Go Grey (Just A Weird Yellow Color)\n\nRed hair color can fade to blonde or white but it will never turn grey. I'm so curious about this one, but I have to admit I have noticed a few stranded greys of my own. I'll check with my sister in 50 years time and let you know.\n\n\n\n7. Everything Hurts Them More Than It Hurts You\n\nRedheads need on average 20 percent more anesthetic than dark-haired people, so think twice next time you brush off a seemingly tiny redhead injury. We're not just being dramatic; it really does hurt more!\n\n\n\n8. Scotland And Ireland Are Winning The Competition\n\nAbout 13 percent of the population in Scotland is redheaded, and in Ireland this figure is around 10 percent. These stats are way above the world average, hovering at one or two percent. A possible reason for this higher concentration is due to the location (in cloudy climates there is less need for protection from the sun).\n\n\n\n9. Redheads Have Less Hair On Their Heads\n\nSo I haven't actually counted (and I would consider myself to have really thick hair), but my sister (the proper redhead) indeed has really thin hair. Apparently fire balls are better able to absorb sun through their heads, because they [usually] live in a cloudy climate, remember? More about the sun thing coming right up:\n\n\n\n10. They Are Better At Generating Vitamin D\n\nIf Ireland and Scotland are famous for one thing, it is for their beautiful green fields. As I always say to people who compliment me on my ancestors' grass: \"It's green because it always rains.\" The cloudy and rainy weather in that part of the world means that not much sunlight gets through, and we need outdoor sun exposure to avoid a Vitamin D deficiency (which can lead to weak bones or even osteoporosis, cancer and heart disease). The redheads in cloudy, grey climates are better at absorbing sun to product Vitamin D than people with dark hair \u2014 which means we are at less risk of osteoporosis but (and I bet you saw this coming) more risk of skin cancer.\n\n11. They Are Not Going Extinct\n\nThis rumor has done the rounds a few times and I am happy to tell you it is not true.

Personally, I think autumn is the best season ever \u2014 it means I get to start wearing leggings as pants again, sport flannel shirts on the regular, eat delicious soups, and go trick-or-treating with my nieces. But for many other anxious, Highly Sensitive Persons (HSPs) like me \u2014 and also for the estimated 10 million people who suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) \u2014 the numerous seasonal and lifestyle changes that accompany fall can cause something called \"autumn anxiety.\"\n\nThough the term \u201cautumn anxiety\u201d is relatively new, (it was coined by a Welsh therapist named Gene Scully back in 2005), seasonal anxiety is definitely not a new thing. Even for people who don\u2019t deal with anxiety disorders, SAD, or the many challenges of being an HSP, the first few weeks of fall can trigger feelings of nervousness. The thing is, no matter who you are, autumn is typically full of changes. With fall comes new class schedules, new jobs, new social commitments, shorter days, cooler weather, a tendency to nest, and less free time in general \u2014 so it\u2019s really not surprising that so many people get anxious in the fall.\n\nFortunately, though, managing this seasonal health phenomenon gets a lot easier if you know what causes autumn anxiety in the first place.\n\nShorter Days\n\nDecreased exposure to sunlight is one of the biggest reasons so many people suffer from both anxiety and depression in the fall and winter. As the days get shorter, the majority of us spend less time out and about in direct sunlight, and that can translate into a vitamin D deficiency. Since literally every tissue in our bodies has vitamin D receptors, and numerous studies have linked vitamin D deficiencies to anxiety and depression, it's really not surprising that even anticipating fewer daylight hours can result in increased anxiety for so many people. Fortunately, taking vitamin D supplements can be an effective way to combat this.\n\nGoing Back To School\n\nThe start of a new school year can trigger autumn anxiety for many people, and it makes perfect sense. Even if you (like myself) always enjoyed going back to school in the fall, the fact is, school is stressful sometimes. On top of that, it's not exactly easy to switch gears from the chill vibes of summer to the hustle of a fall semester. So when you add the responsibility of maintaining a new course load (whether they're your courses or your kid's) on top of the changing weather and shorter days that accompany fall, that's just a whole lot of newness to deal with at once.\n\nReasonably, change of that magnitude is hard for a lot of people to deal with \u2014 especially people who are already prone to anxiety. As Therese Borchard put it for Everyday Health, \"Autumn is full of new things: new schedules, new jobs, new schools, new assignments. It\u2019s no wonder why some of us experience heart palpitations trying to process it all.\"\n\nSeasonal Allergies\n\nA 2009 study in the Journal of Affective Disorders found that the process a person goes through when they're fighting off an infection looks the same as when that person is depressed or manic. Other studies have found that changes in allergy symptoms during low and high pollen seasons correlate with higher anxiety and depression scores. This most likely happens because allergies attack the immune system, and the body responds by pumping cytokines (proteins that signal inflammation to our cells) through the blood stream. Understandably, if your body starts freaking out as soon as fall rolls around, your mind is probably going to follow suit. So if you suffer from both fall allergies and autumn anxiety, know that treating your allergies should help you treat your anxiety as well.", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/189317-autumn-anxiety-is-a-real-thing-heres-what-causes-it", "summary": "Though the term \u201cautumn anxiety\u201d is relatively new, (it was coined by a Welsh therapist named Gene Scully back in 2005), seasonal anxiety is definitely not a new thing.\nFortunately, though, managing this seasonal health phenomenon gets a lot easier if you know what causes autumn anxiety in the first place.\nFortunately, taking vitamin D supplements can be an effective way to combat this.\nGoing Back To SchoolThe start of a new school year can trigger autumn anxiety for many people, and it makes perfect sense.\nSo if you suffer from both fall allergies and autumn anxiety, know that treating your allergies should help you treat your anxiety as well.", "timescraped": 1513838437.012311, "category": {"words": 636, "personal": 7, "thirdperson": 2, "condition": 13, "recovery": 0}}, "2e53e3c8a9c0d76ca39e6297b9be81ce": {"title": "5 Different Types Of Anxiety Disorders & How To Distinguish Between Them", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/2017/1/16/ab3fcb6d-e1aa-480e-9e74-9cd4f58500cd.jpg?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "text": "The term \u201canxiety\u201d is widely used to cover so many different disorders, but it's actually a very broad term. Someone who struggles with Social Anxiety Disorder, for example, is going to have a different set of triggers than someone coping with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) might. As an anxious person myself, I wanted to learn more about some of the different types of anxiety disorders out there \u2014 and how to distinguish which one(s) I might be struggling with.\n\nJodi Aman, psychotherapist and author of You 1 Anxiety 0, agreed to speak to Bustle about some of the more common different kinds of anxiety. Aman, who's worked as a counselor since 1994, believes that all anxiety disorders stem from the same three things: control issues, hormones, and the way you make meaning out of your anxiety. She also believes that anxiety can be more than just managed, but completely cured. (Sign me up, am I right?) Aman says that it\u2019s customary for mental health professionals to teach their patients how to manage anxiety, but she feels like making the most out of living with chronic anxiety isn\u2019t the only option.\n\nThe first step is identifying the issue and learning more about it \u2014 so here are five different types of anxiety you should know.\n\nSocial Anxiety Disorder\n\nAccording to the ADAA, social anxiety usually manifests around age 13, and at least 15 million Americans struggle with it. Further, unlike some mental illness, social anxiety reportedly affects men just as much as it affects women. Aman tells Bustle that social anxiety is just regular anxiety that's attached itself to the fear of being around other people. Unfortunately, what that means is the disorder can show itself with physical symptoms of panic (like sweating, racing heart, etc.) related to social activities. Scripting conversations in advance of everyday interactions is another obvious sign of social anxiety disorder. (And it's one that I'm all too familiar with, myself.) Although it's true that the symptoms of social anxiety are consistently similar from person to person, the specifics of what triggers someone's social anxiety depend entirely on the individual who suffers from it.\n\nAs Aman explains it, \"Different people experience it differently. In different contexts, their social anxiety will come out.\" So basically, while some people (like myself) get socially anxious before a big party full of new people, that doesn't necessarily mean that all social situations will trigger someone with social anxiety.\n\nFor example, I feel very little social anxiety when I go to concerts, because crowds of strangers don't usually bother me. I consider myself a pretty socially anxious person, but I also relish anonymity. For this reason, I sometimes enjoy the energy and camouflage that comes with being part of a large crowd. (When I lived in NYC, I visited Times Square often for this very reason.) House parties full of new people, on the other hand, can freak me out so much that chest pains and sweaty palms become my reality. It's different for everyone.\n\nSituational (Or Seasonal) Anxiety Disorder\n\nTo the people who call my anxiety \"selfish\" https://t.co/0Hv1m1AfCl pic.twitter.com/LtJOhSMVoq \u2014 Bustle (@bustle) January 4, 2017\n\nThere's not exactly a wealth of reliable information regarding just how many people suffer from situational anxiety, because the term is incredibly broad and not everyone recognizes it. More than 10 million people suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder, (SAD) however, and \"autumn anxiety\" is one form of that. So basically, situational anxiety is a flexible term for anxiety that's attached itself to a specific memory, season, or situation.\n\nBecause it's attached to something, someone, or sometime specific, situational anxiety is arguably one of the more manageable forms of anxiety. Situational and seasonal anxiety can still be incredibly difficult to conquer, though, because doing so means resetting your amygdala. As you probably know, your amygdala is the part of your brain that triggers fear responses and emotions. What you might not know is that once your amygdala catalogs a memory as unsafe, it will always trigger a fear response when the circumstances of that memory are re-created.\n\nAman says it's kind of like post-traumatic stress disorder (though PTSD is different, and we'll get to that in a minute.) Whenever someone makes a memory where they felt unsafe, \"their amygdala sets that memory in. Like, 'OK, if we ever feel this way again, we might be in danger.\" This essentially means that once your amygdala recognizes a certain situation or season as a potential threat to your well-being, it's hardwired to put you on alert mode whenever you encounter that same situation again.\n\nPost-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)\n\nPTSD-induced anxiety is the direct result of a deeply traumatic experience, and the intense flashbacks that accompany PTSD are no joke. For these reasons and more, Aman says that post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) isn't quite like any other anxiety disorder. Though it's not uncommon to have PTSD about panic attacks \u2014 and the majority of anxiety develops because of a traumatic memory \u2014 PTSD is still different. \"There's a huge element of anxiety with PTSD,\" Aman says, \"but it comes from something else.\"\n\nAccording to the ADAA, the \"something else\" that most often causes PTSD to develop is sexual assault. More than seven million Americans suffer from PTSD, and women are more likely to be affected by it than men. It should be noted, however, that rape is the most likely trigger of PTSD in both men and women. In fact, 65 percent of men who are raped will develop PTSD, according to the ADAA. For women, that percentage is closer to 46.\n\nPanic Disorder\n\nSix million Americans struggle with Panic Disorder, the ADAA reports. Women are twice as likely to suffer from Panic Disorder as men, and it's not at all uncommon for someone who suffers from Panic Disorder to also struggle with depression. Symptoms of panic disorder range from frequent panic attacks to heart palpitations, all of which leave the sufferer feeling even more out of control.\n\nIt's important to understand that it doesn't always take much to trigger someone with Panic Disorder. Further, once their panic has set in, they're probably going to feel like it's impossible to shut off. Aman explained it to Bustle this way: \"their amygdala is going to trigger, and they're going to have the adrenaline and the norepinephrin, and then it feels so out of control that it's going to continue.\" According to Aman, \"their cortex is like, 'yes, I feel in danger,' even if they don't see danger around them.\"\n\nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder\n\nSigns of anxiety that are common in women https://t.co/1cu5t9dlvO pic.twitter.com/OfJcL828BN \u2014 Bustle (@bustle) December 16, 2016\n\nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is quite common, as far as anxiety disorders go. GAD affects nearly seven million American adults, and women are twice as likely to be affected as men. When left unchecked, GAD can negatively affect everything from your physical health to your relationships, so you definitely shouldn't ignore any GAD symptoms that you might have. Signs of GAD include panic attacks, worrying about worrying, social withdrawal, and compulsive behaviors. (Like excessive cleaning and quadruple-checking your stove top before leaving your apartment.)\n\nAs its name implies, Generalized Anxiety can be triggered by literally anything that your brain perceives as a threat \u2014 whether that perceived threat is to your safety, your reputation, or your ability to handle whatever life throws at you. As Aman puts it, \"mostly, anxiety is really based in [the idea that] 'you can't do that.'\"\n\nSpeaking from personal experience, I can tell you that GAD can leave you feeling like you're not capable of the simplest tasks, which can be disempowering. So among other things, living with GAD means continually proving yourself to yourself.\n\nLuckily, getting help for any of these disorders, as well as learning about the simple things you can do to protect your mental health on a daily basis, makes a real difference.", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/p/5-different-types-of-anxiety-disorders-how-to-distinguish-between-them-30575", "summary": "Social Anxiety DisorderAccording to the ADAA, social anxiety usually manifests around age 13, and at least 15 million Americans struggle with it.\nAman tells Bustle that social anxiety is just regular anxiety that's attached itself to the fear of being around other people.\nScripting conversations in advance of everyday interactions is another obvious sign of social anxiety disorder.\nAlthough it's true that the symptoms of social anxiety are consistently similar from person to person, the specifics of what triggers someone's social anxiety depend entirely on the individual who suffers from it.\nGeneralized Anxiety DisorderSigns of anxiety that are common in women https://t.co/1cu5t9dlvO pic.twitter.com/OfJcL828BN \u2014 Bustle (@bustle) December 16, 2016Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is quite common, as far as anxiety disorders go.", "timescraped": 1513838438.408706, "category": {"words": 1332, "personal": 18, "thirdperson": 9, "condition": 39, "recovery": 0}}, "d4d5c443d6deaf5a480abd17939da801": {"title": "Common Habits That Can Actually Be Signs Of Anxiety", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/2017/3/21/6857f444-650e-464d-b698-21151dacd258.jpg?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "text": "Speaking from both personal experience and extensive research, I can tell you that there are several upsides to having high-functioning anxiety. (No, seriously.) For one thing, recent research suggests that there\u2019s a very real link between anxiety and intelligence. Several studies have shown that anxious people (or even just people who worry a lot) have higher IQs than their more laid-back peers. On top of that, more often than not, creative geniuses suffer from an anxiety disorder of some kind. All of that said, one of the downsides of being high-functioning and anxious is that people don\u2019t always realize when you\u2019re suffering. Sometimes anxiety symptoms seem like something other than anxiety, and this is especially true for anyone who is high-functioning enough to maintain active social lives, jobs, and romantic relationships.\n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t know how high-functioning I am when it comes right down to it. I mean, I\u2019m able to hold down a job, keep up with my exercise schedule, and cultivate a social life \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean my anxiety doesn\u2019t interfere with my ability to write articles or be on time for parties. Sometimes, my anxiety pushes me to do some seemingly selfish things in the name of self-care, and I don\u2019t think it makes me any easier to date. That said, when controlled, my anxiety is also what pushes me to be diligent and hardworking. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d exercise daily if it didn\u2019t feel like an act of survival, and I think dealing with anxiety might make me more sensitive to other people with chronic illnesses, too. Still, it can be really frustrating when my anxiety looks like rudeness or selfishness to others. Believe it or not, it\u2019s even a little bit upsetting when anxiety looks like self-discipline or motivation.\n\nOn that note, here are a few things that can be anxious habits, whether they seem like it or not.\n\nNeeding To Exercise Daily\n\nOK, so I get that not everyone uses physical activity to treat their anxiety. Further, exercise can feel similar to a panic attack for some people \u2014 because both work outs and panic attacks increase our heart rate, breathing, and adrenaline.\n\nThat said, for me and so many other people, exercise is pretty much the go-to treatment for anxiety. This is even more true for those of us who are trying to treat anxiety without medication. So while it might seem like your friend who works out six days a week is just super-dedicated to fitness, it's possible that they rely on those frequent gym trips to stay functioning. I know that's how it works for me, anyway. It's been this way since I was a kid, too. While this is generally healthy, of course, a compulsive need to exercise can also be an anxiety disorder in itself.\n\nTalking Super-Fast\n\nOK, so I don't know if this was the case with Rory and Lorelei, but anxiety really can make you talk super-fast. This is even more true if you suffer from both an anxiety disorder and a bipolar disorder. (In fact, \"talking very fast\" is actually one of the symptoms of a manic episode.) Ironically, social anxiety can cause people to talk fast, or in excess, too. This doesn't mean everyone who talks fast is anxious, but there is definitely a link between anxiety and speech abnormalities.\n\nSo if you or someone you love tends to talk at the speed of Gilmore, know that it could very well be the direct result of their coffee intake \u2014 but remember that it might just be a symptom of their anxiety. Also keep in mind that anxiety messes with speech patterns in a variety of other ways, too. Which brings us to...\n\n...Or Not Talking Much At All\n\nIn addition to the fact that anxiety is best friends with both overthinking and insecurity, anxiety can cause inflammation of the throat. Not only is throat inflammation uncomfortable, I can tell you from experience that it makes you feel like you have an actual lump in your throat. Since anxiety also messes with our ability to move facial muscles, it's not surprising that anxiety can literally silence the people who struggle with it.\n\nThe mind and body are connected, and if you're an anxious person, that means your nerves can literally prevent you from speaking. Personally, I can't count the times I've felt too anxious to talk. What's more is, I deal with this anxiety symptom even when I'm in the company of my closest friends. So the next time you're with a friend and they seem unresponsive or bored, ask them if they're feeling anxious. They may only be able to nod \"yes\" or \"no,\" but they'll appreciate your concern. Plus, I'm guessing it beats feeling like your buddy is ignoring you for no apparent reason.\n\nTaking Forever To Make Decisions\n\nIndecision might seem like an annoying quirk that makes your mom/friend/partner late to everything \u2014 but it can be much more serious than that. If you (or someone you know) has been experiencing difficulty making decisions for some time, it could mean you're dealing with anxiety and/or depression. Not only is indecision a legitimate symptom of both of these illnesses, indecision actually works to increase anxiety \u2014 which can push sufferers into a downward spiral of self-sustaining uncertainty and fear.\n\nFortunately, you can learn how to become more decisive. If that doesn't seem realistic to you right now, that's OK, too. There are also ways you can make your indecision work for you.\n\nDaydreaming Excessively\n\nSomerClinic on YouTube\n\nTo be clear, \"Maladaptive Daydreaming\" (MD) \u2014 the psychological concept in which excessive fantasizing can replace human interaction and interfere with everyday life \u2014 isn't recognized as a mental disorder by the entire mental healthcare community. The term has only been around since Eli Somer, a professor of Clinical Psychology at the University of Haifa, coined it in 2002 \u2014 so there's not exactly a ton of research on it, either.\n\nThat said, many experts do believe that Maladaptive Daydreaming is a diagnosable mental disorder, and there's a huge online community/support group of \"Maladaptive Daydreamers.\" Further still, although MD is treated as its own illness, people with anxiety disorders often suffer from it as well. So if it seems like someone you love is never really present when you're with them, know that it might not have anything to do with you. Also keep in mind that MD is addictive and pathological, which means those who struggle with it need as much support and understanding as they can get.", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/p/common-habits-that-can-actually-be-signs-of-anxiety-43127", "summary": "Speaking from both personal experience and extensive research, I can tell you that there are several upsides to having high-functioning anxiety.\nOn top of that, more often than not, creative geniuses suffer from an anxiety disorder of some kind.\nPersonally, I don\u2019t know how high-functioning I am when it comes right down to it.\nWhile this is generally healthy, of course, a compulsive need to exercise can also be an anxiety disorder in itself.\nThis is even more true if you suffer from both an anxiety disorder and a bipolar disorder.", "timescraped": 1513838439.855047, "category": {"words": 1099, "personal": 26, "thirdperson": 12, "condition": 32, "recovery": 4}}, "c4c05c9c433316ec96b5778060c2b0d0": {"title": "These Women Believe Crystals Are The Reason They\u2019re Still Sober", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/uploads/image/2017/10/17/f8a524ef-d5c7-4075-9276-d26f6171965a-cancrystalshelpyouovercomeanaddiction_header.png?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "text": "For the month of October, Bustle's #blessed series will explore how young women are searching for meaning, finding connections to a higher power and navigating spirituality in 2017.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t heard about the recent craze of using crystals for healing and wellness, you just might be living under a rock (sorry, had to). Over the last few years, the practice \u2014 which holds that gemstones can be used to promote physical and spiritual health \u2014 has exploded out of the once-marginalized world of covens and New Age psychics, and become a massive mainstream phenomena, especially among millennials. But according to some crystal advocates, the stones don\u2019t just encourage abstract benefits like \"vibrational healing\" and \"chakra alignment\" \u2014 many claim they can also provide very tangible help to those who are struggling to stay sober.\n\nAccording to the people who utilize them, crystals heal by acting as conduits for positive intentions. They say that you can tap into that power in a wide variety of ways \u2014 from bathing or meditating with crystals to using crystal sex toys \u2014 and that doing so can provide benefits that range from improving confidence to curing forms of chronic fatigue. And, some advocates say, crystals can support (or supplant) traditional recovery practices like psychotherapy, support groups, medication-assisted treatment and other clinically-proven addiction therapies.\n\nBut as a health and science writer (as well as a practicing witch), I\u2019ve always taken my crystal store guy\u2019s claims of cosmic divinity with a grain of salt \u2014 scientifically speaking, there is no evidence that crystals can cure any diseases. So, as both a logically-minded advocate for recovery and a passionate metaphysical romantic, I decided to get to the bottom of these claims that crystals can help you get sober.\n\nThe \"Sobriety Stone\"\n\nI first heard about people using crystals to overcome their addictions from my friend Maria*, who is two years sober and has tried everything from Alcoholic\u2019s Anonymous, to therapy, to medical marijuana, and yes, even witchcraft, in her journey to recovery. And according to her, boy, were there lots of people trying out crystal healing and advocating for its use in her 12-step program.\n\nA quick search of recovery forums and message boards confirmed her stories. Amethyst, a purple quartz-like crystal known as the \u201csobriety stone\u201d in many recovery circles, is typically the talisman of choice \u2014 though others recommend lithium quartz, a silvery-white metal best known for its real-world use as an ingredient in medications for mental health disorders, as well as smokey quartz, a dark grey silicate touted for its ability to provide protection against negativity and peer pressure.\n\nrachelhanberryyoga/Instagram\n\nFor Maria, who tried out both amethyst and lithium during her brief stint in AA, using crystals was not the magic catalyst her fellow group members promised. But I did recently speak to two women who swear that something in the stones seriously helped them make the transition into sobriety.\n\nRuby Warrington, author of Material Girl, Mystical World: The Now Age Guide to a High Vibe Life and founder of the cosmic lifestyle website The Numinous has been using metaphysical practices to break her attachment to alcohol and other drugs. Over the past six years, Ruby has tried out everything from meditation and yoga to astrology and tarot in her journey to what she calls a \u201csober-curious\u201d lifestyle.\n\nAs she details in her 2017 book, Warrington left her job as a fashion editor at the Sunday Times in 2010, moving from London to New York City as part of a long journey to find fulfillment from the great beyond. Though she still drinks from time to time, the 41-year-old creative director claims her relationship to alcohol has changed dramatically since she started using crystals.\n\n\u201cFor the past year, I\u2019ve had a large piece of amethyst on my nightstand,\u201d Warrington tells Bustle, who first started investigating the healing properties of crystals while writing a story for her site. \u201cAnd I have to say, this definitely has been the year where I\u2019ve really felt a shift from being someone who was always consciously aware of the fact that I was choosing not to drink, to it being something I don\u2019t really think about anymore.\u201d\n\nInstagram/the_numinous\n\nAccording to Ruby, amethyst is known as the \u201csobriety stone\u201d because it\u2019s purported to heighten your spiritual connection to the astral plane and bring about relaxation \u2014 two effects many people look for in alcohol. Since picking up the stone at a small crystal shop in the West Village last spring, Ruby says she\u2019s only had a drink three or four times, and no longer gets out of control when she does choose to imbibe.\n\n\u201cI never thought I would be that person,\u201d Warrington told me. \u201cI thought that my addiction, or my drinking patterns, were so deeply ingrained that it would always be a kind of battle for me.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, across the pond, UK yoga instructor and life coach Rachel Hanberry says she had a similar experience with a massive amethyst crystal she picked up on Instagram while in the midst of her own battle with alcohol addiction.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d been drawn to the stone for a while, kept seeing pictures of it and thought it was beautiful,\u201d Hanberry tells Bustle. Unlike Warrington, who\u2019s in the business of knowing about all sorts of metaphysical approaches, Hanberry \u201cdidn\u2019t know anyone who had used it around me or before in their teachings.\u201d\n\nGuided by intuition, Rachel started meditating with her amethyst last winter, practicing with it on her yoga mat and sleeping with it under her pillow at night. \u201cMy attitude toward alcohol really changed that final time I said that\u2019s enough and gave myself permission to not ever have to drink again,\u201d Hanberry recalls, who now regularly blogs about her recovery and sobriety. \u201cI guess the stone has always really reinforced that in me.\u201d\n\nrachelhanberryyoga/Instagram\n\n\u201cThat crystal becomes like a talisman, that I can look at and be reminded of my own power to create my reality through my actions and choices.\u201d\n\nAs to why and how the crystals work, both Hanberry and Warrington believe their power comes from the way the crystals remind them every day of their own inner power and determination to keep their addictions at bay.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s that connection to something bigger than us, the fact that they\u2019re a natural substance you can physically hold and that connects you to your higher self, or that greater sense of being,\u201d Hanberry explains.\n\n\u201cThat crystal becomes like a talisman, that I can look at and be reminded of the power of my thoughts and my own power to create my reality through my actions and choices,\u201d Warrington adds.\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t Come Back If You\u2019re Going To Keep Doing That\u2019\n\nBut while it's clear that some people absolutely feel that crystals support their sobriety, the question of what crystal healing practitioners think people in recovery should expect from their crystals is much more complex.\n\nOne of the first things Kalisa Augustine, an energy worker and certified Crystal Light Bed Therapist, told me when I asked her about using crystals to get sober, was this: \u201cWhen it comes to addiction, it is dangerous to put all of your credence in a crystal, as if that is going to heal you.\u201d In fact, the high-profile metaphysician \u2014 who has worked with the likes of Sir Patrick Stewart, Parker Posey, Zoe Kravitz and Melanie Laurent \u2014 almost didn\u2019t talk to me for this article because of what she feels is a huge misunderstanding about her practice.\n\nkalisa_augustine/Instagram\n\n\u201cThe important thing to remember here is that this is very subtle energy stuff, stuff that you can really only feel once you get to a place of balance\u201d Augustine tells Bustle. \u201cPeople who are suffering from a really serious addiction are not going to be attuned to that subtle energy. The will to heal on that level, that comes from within.\u201d\n\nAccording to Augustine, the way she and many other practitioners use crystals today is based off of something called \u201cquantum alchemy\u201d \u2014 a New Age theory first popularized by IBM scientist Marcel Vogel in the 1970s. After conducting research on how crystals can be used in everything from watches to computer chips as conduits for electromagnetic energy, Vogel began trying to apply the science to more spiritual areas of study.\n\nVogel\u2019s disciples believe that the grid-like crystalline structures of different gemstones can help humans tap into an invisible electromagnetic field around the body \u2014 \u201cThe soul, the life force, the chi, whatever you want to call it,\u201d Augustine explains \u2014 allowing positive energy to flow into the body while pushing negative energy out, just as the silica crystals in our computer chips help information flow in and out.\n\n\u201cAll sorts of well-intentioned people have come up with all kinds of unproven, interesting-sounding approaches. The problem with them is that most of them have not been tested and many don\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nkalisa_augustine/Instagram\n\nBut again, she is careful to explain, this healing is dependent on what you bring to the table \u2014 crystals won't do the heavy lifting for you. For example, \u201cI once had a younger girl come in and she was doing a lot of [cocaine],\u201d recalls Augustine. \u201cShe wanted all these higher vibe things to happen in the world. So I kept cleaning her out and cleaning her out, and ended up getting to a point where I said \u2018Don\u2019t come back if you\u2019re going to keep doing that.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Limits of Crystal Healing\n\nKathleen M. Carroll, PhD, professor of psychiatry at Yale University\u2019s School of Medicine, says that those looking to crystals to keep them sober should think twice. Carroll, who has devoted her career to analyzing behavioral treatments and medical techniques for treating addiction, tells Bustle: \u201cAll sorts of well-intentioned people have come up with all kinds of unproven, interesting-sounding approaches. The problem with them is that most of them have not been tested and many don\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nDr. Carroll\u2019s bottom-line regarding using crystals to help overcome an addiction is that while meditating with gemstones might make you feel better on an emotional level, crystals aren\u2019t going to change the fundamental nature of addiction \u2014 which is a serious physical and mental illness that often requires people to re-train both their brains and bodies on a biological level to overcome it.\n\nDr. Carroll suggests that, instead of spending money on $300-a-pop Crystal Light Bed therapy sessions or giant amethyst crystals, people fighting addictions use clinically-approved treatments like naltrexone for alcohol and opioid use disorders, medication-assisted treatments like buprenorphine and methadone for heroin addiction, and cognitive behavioral therapy and support groups like AA, NA and Rational Recovery. \u201cWhy waste your time or risk your money or your health when there are affordable, effective, and proven treatments available?\u201d she asks.\n\nLaura Callaghan/Bustle\n\nThat being said, Dr. Carroll is in support of doing further testing on meditation's role in recovery (to their credit, crystal therapy practitioners often use meditation in tandem with their work). \u201cWe can learn a lot from approaches that have been around for a long time, like mindfulness,\u201d she explains. And current research on meditation \u2014 some of which indicates that meditating on thoughts of well being can potentially make people more mentally and physically resilient \u2014offers a hint as to why people might find meditating with their crystals to be such a helpful part of their recovery program.\n\nAs for why some people feel that crystals specifically help their recovery, a 2001 study on crystal healing by Dr. Christopher French, head of the anomalistic psychology research institute at the University of London, suggests that the power of the placebo effect could be why people who love gemstones feel so good after using them.\n\nIn that study, French asked 80 people to meditate for five minutes while holding either a real quartz crystal or a fake crystal that they believed was real. Half of the study subjects were primed to notice any effects that the crystals might have on them (i.e. tingling or warmth) before meditating, while half were not. Each participant was then given a survey about the effects of their crystal healing session.\n\nUnfortunately for all of the vendors of $100 Vogel-cut crystals out there, the healing effects reported by participants were no different whether they received fake crystals or the real quartz talismans. \u201cBut whether or not you judge crystal healing or any other form of [complementary and alternative medicine] to be totally worthless depends upon your attitude to placebo effects\" noted French in his conclusion for the study.\n\nSo, can crystals really help you overcome an addiction? According to both the doctors and crystal therapists I talked to, probably not without first accessing the proper support structures and treatment for recovery. But if you\u2019re looking for a New Age way to help supplement your transition to a healthier lifestyle, or simply a visual reminder to help keep you grounded in your journey to recovery, why not? If buying an amethyst or a tourmaline and wearing it proudly as a symbol of your journey to mindful sobriety helps you, I\u2019m all for the metaphysical addition.\n\nRead more #blessed:\n\nHow I Found Out My Grandma Was A Witch\n\nStockpiles, Self-Reliance, & Survival Skills \u2014 How Some Women Are Preparing For Our Uncertain Future\n\nHow Antisemitism And Ivanka Trump Radicalized Young Jewish Women\n\nWhy My Hinduism Includes Feminism And Abortion", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/p/these-women-believe-crystals-are-the-reason-theyre-still-sober-2912383", "summary": "If you haven\u2019t heard about the recent craze of using crystals for healing and wellness, you just might be living under a rock (sorry, had to).\nAnd according to her, boy, were there lots of people trying out crystal healing and advocating for its use in her 12-step program.\nrachelhanberryyoga/InstagramFor Maria, who tried out both amethyst and lithium during her brief stint in AA, using crystals was not the magic catalyst her fellow group members promised.\nThough she still drinks from time to time, the 41-year-old creative director claims her relationship to alcohol has changed dramatically since she started using crystals.\nEach participant was then given a survey about the effects of their crystal healing session.", "timescraped": 1513838419.632582, "category": {"words": 2188, "personal": 19, "thirdperson": 61, "condition": 2, "recovery": 8}}, "a2afe10ec5f17ef45b4839c14d0ed016": {"title": "This Woman Took Herself On A Date On Snapchat After Being Stood Up, But There's More To The Story & It's Incredibly Important", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost%2F2016%2F9%2F14%2Fa2fdc74a-bfda-4392-9954-ec31508ab9b2.png?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "text": "This week, the internet has been aflutter over the story of Mimi Black, a Scottish woman who took herself on a date after being stood up and uploaded the ensuing lovely day to Snapchat. At first glance, it's the kind of \"revenge on a rude date\" tale that lends itself well to going viral, but there's far more to the story than a single tweet can capture \u2014 and, in fact, the big picture is actually incredibly important.\n\nBlack runs a mental health blog, 100 Days of Mimi, chronicling her struggle with bipolar disorder. \"I decided to become a mental health blogger after I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder at 19 and I wanted to keep a mood diary whilst raising awareness for Bipolar Disorder in young people, so I documented such on the blog,\" she tells Bustle over email.\n\nAccording to her blog, she spent much of June dealing with a depressive episode, but in mid-July, she traveled to Glasgow to meet someone at a bar. \"Long story short, he didn\u2019t show up,\" she wrote on 100 Days of Mimi. After explaining what happened to her friends, she decided to treat herself to an evening out in Glasgow anyway.\n\n\n\n\"Even the idea of travelling alone earlier had made me feel kind of nauseous, but as I was sitting on the street on my own realizing my fate \u2013 I guess I felt somewhat calm. ... As nervous as I felt sitting in a strange bar in Glasgow on my own, it felt oddly empowering,\" she wrote. Black recorded her evening on Snapchat and sent it to her friends, and on July 15, she posted the story online.\n\n\"A boy stood me up so I decided to have the best date with myself, and it was great,\" she tweeted.\n\n[Twitter Embed: https://twitter.com/AymieBlack/status/753938728196841472]\n\nThe tweet quickly went viral, receiving more than 16,000 likes and almost 6,000 retweets. Although many applauded her actions, some zeroed in on Black's appearance or claimed that she was attention-seeking. The trolls became so overwhelming that she took to her blog to discuss her day in Glasgow as well as the aftermath.\n\n\n\n\"People speculate whether or not I\u2019ve had plastic surgery, commented that I wear too much makeup or pondered whether I\u2019m promoting lingerie from Ann Summers,\" she wrote on 100 Days of Mimi. \"What\u2019s most upsetting is those who comment that I must be desperate to get married, a prostitute, a complete airhead or someone who just wants to so desperately be famous.\"\n\n\n\nMisogynist trolls are virtually everywhere online; just a few days ago, actress and star of the Ghostbusters remake Leslie Jones left Twitter after being subject to a torrent of racist and sexist abuse from users of the social network. Research has shown that gender-based harassment is so common online that it's practically the norm, as Black discovered when the Internet turned its attention her way. In addition to the trolls, however, she took issue with the way the media presented her story as a \"sassy middle finger\" to the man who stood her up. Rather than making it about a man, she explained on 100 Days of Mimi, her date was about her slow recovery from mental illness.\n\n\"This story wasn\u2019t about a boy or bitterness, it was about feeling good about yourself even when the circumstances can make you feel pretty low. It took me so much courage to get out of the place that I was in,\" she wrote on the blog.\n\nLater, she described the difficulty of dating as someone who has a mental illness. \"What part of the conversation at dinner do I talk about my Bipolar Disorder?\" she wrote. \"How do I mention I\u2019ve just got over a serious episode in my illness? Do I mention anything? I was almost relieved these conversations didn\u2019t have to take place, safe in the security of the company of myself. Doing things alone, like I\u2019ve wanted to do for months.\"\n\nShe ended the post with a parting message for the trolls. \"I felt brave when I ordered a drink, as silly as that sounds to you, and I felt poised and attractive in my new lingerie,\" she wrote. \"I felt like a real girl, not the ill girl. So please don\u2019t take my positivity away. I felt confident, sexy, sassy and happy \u2013 and I\u2019d never want any other woman to feel any differently.\"\n\nCheck out 100 Days of Mimi to read more about Black's struggle with bipolar disorder and the aftermath of going viral.

They remind you of the small joys and make you laugh in your darkest moments, right? Eh, not always. Don't get me wrong; having buddies around is an important part of anyone's social life and can definitely be a beneficial component of healing from any kind of mental illness. But just because your friends are there doesn't mean they're really there, if you get what I mean. People who have never faced a disorder like depression may not truly know what you're going through, and that might create a fundamental disconnect.\n \nHowever, you have to keep in mind that your main priority is taking care of yourself. That starts with taking a good, hard look at the influences in your life. Should you find that one, or several, of your friendships are making you feel worse, talk with someone you trust \u2014 maybe a parent or a licensed therapist/psychologist \u2014about how you can put space between yourself and these friends. But before we get ahead of ourselves, let's identify whether the actions of your besties aren't lifting you up.\n\nHere are five ways your friends might be worsening your depression.\n\n1. They Take You Drinking\n\n[Embed]\n\nWhen you see a crew of females on your favorite TV show gathering after the work week comes to a close, what are they usually doing? Enjoying happy hour, of course! It's the most common way to meet up, unwind from stress, and make up for lost time; at least, that's what the media tells us. As an individual who is being treated for depression, though, drinking regularly may be stunting your own attempts to feel better.\n\nAlcohol may initially make you feel like all is well and good, but it may make you crash and feel worse later \u2014 plus, drinking can interfere with many anti-depressants. When you have one too many drinks, you're also more inclined to act out in negative ways \u2014 a lesson you probably learned many times in college, yet it holds true today. Even if you don't have an unhealthy history with booze, it's best to drink in moderation, to keep things as uncomplicated as possible.\n\nBut for friends who don't have the same chemical imbalances as you do, smashing some martinis every Thursday night won't have the same effects on their mood and overall well-being. So if they're still encouraging you to hit the 2-for-1 happy hour, it's not necessarily that they don't give a damn about your condition; they just might not even be aware of what you're going through. Speak up for yourself \u2014 though not necessarily to the whole lot of them at once while you're on the way to the bar \u2014 because you can't expect any of them to comprehend what you need if you don't articulate it.\n\n2. They Don't Live Active Lifestyles\n\n[Embed]\n\nIf you've heard it once, you've heard it a thousand times: exercise is scientifically proven to alleviate symptoms of depression, and its favorable effects are said to last longer than the benefits of anti-depressants. Keeping a regular exercise regimen going will definitely help you even out your moods, and it might even lessen the blow of a looming depressive episode.\n\nBut we all know how tough it is to go to that spin class religiously without a reliable gym buddy \u2014 and if you've got friends who all loathe exercise, it can make making that 6 a.m. session a lot harder. Your friends might enjoy spending their free time doing not-so-active things instead of getting their heart rate up; while it's nobody's place to judge, there's no denying that their choices could be a poor influence on you. Instead of spending your free time scrolling through Pinterest and snacking on Cheetos with them, it's more beneficial to find at least a few new friends who are interested in exercise.\n\n\n\nNot all your friends have to be training for a marathon or anything like that in order to be a positive influence. But I promise, you will see a few marvelous improvements in your own health if you start hanging around people who are frequently active. It's a contagious habit \u2014 and a great one to cultivate if you are living with a mental illness.\n\n3. They Avoid Talking About Your Illness\n\n[Embed]\n\nNo matter how many articles and blog posts are available online these days about the ins and outs of dealing with depression, it's still not an easy topic to chat about over Sunday brunch. People who have never experienced the loneliness and confusion of mental illness may freeze up if the conversation veers in that direction, and although it's a normal reaction, it's not helpful for you. Part of the recovery process is being fully honest about your current state with the individuals you consider to be your closest confidants.\n\n\n\nThe more you experience friends dodging the subject, the more you might feel like it's taboo, like you're damaged goods and the stuff you wrestle with isn't worth anybody's time and attention \u2014 even if you can't quite articulate those feelings at the time. In some cases, long-term effects of avoidance in social situations can lead to relapse and further self-harm.\n\nIf you feel like you're not being seen or heard in ways that are beneficial, don't be afraid to sit down with your bestie and tell her that you could use a little extra emotional support. Without accusing her of being insensitive, kindly ask her to lend you a non-judgmental ear; if she's a solid buddy, she'll drop everything to take you out for a walk and listen to whatever is on your heart.\n\n4. They Say Insensitive Things\n\n[Embed]\n\nThis is a hard one to pinpoint, simply because a lot of the things people say about depression aren't meant to be hurtful \u2014 they are just a reflection of the fact that our society as a whole needs to redefine how we think of mental illness, as well as how we treat those who have been diagnosed with it. That being said, the comments your friends are slipping in here and there might be making you feel worse than you think.\n\n\n\nIt requires a lot of energy for someone with depression to process insensitive remarks, like, \"Just cheer up\" or, my personal pet peeve, \"It's all in your head.\" You'd think we'd be able to let them roll off like water off a duck's back, but it's far more complicated than that. We're already physically tired, lonely, and insecure about everything that's happening in the world. The last thing we need is a friend telling us that we're being dramatic about something.\n\nAre these commonly tossed around in your life by people you trust? Remember, you're not the only depressed person dealing with them, and don't forget that you have every right to stand up for yourself and ask them to cool it with the commentary. They'll likely respond with gentleness, because they do love you, even if their words sometimes imply they don't completely understand you.\n\n5. They Aren't Healthy Eaters\n\n[Embed]\n\nFeeling bad and eating poorly can often go hand-in-hand. Take it from me, a girl who used to eat three McDonald's combo meals in the backseat of my car every time my depression felt overwhelming. But these habits are precisely the ones that can spiral us even further out of control of our emotions; and many studies have shown that a healthy diet and lifestyle can often help us ward off severe symptoms.\n\nMultiple studies have shown that healthy food can help with depression. For example, the journal BMC Medicine recently published a study showing that the Mediterranean diet \u2014 lots of veggies, fruits, legumes, and nuts, and moderate alcohol consumption \u2014 can help prevent some depressive symptoms.\n\nIf you consistently find yourself in a group of folks who love packaged foods, processed sugars, and any other unhealthy fare, you may find it harder to take care of yourself in the long run. So you may want to take some steps to make sure that your social group doesn't control what you eat \u2014if you're going out with friends who love food that you know makes you feel bad, eat a healthy meal beforehand or request that you go to a restaurant that has suitable food for you. Your health comes first, no matter how weird they might think you are for choosing a lentil burger over a double bacon Swiss cheeseburger. Friends who can deal with that \u2014 and all the other changes and choices listed above \u2014 are friends worth sticking with.\n\n\n\nImages: Wrangler/Fotolia; Giphy (5)", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/114212-5-ways-your-friends-might-be-worsening-your-depression", "summary": "One of the first pieces of advice you'll hear when you're getting treated for clinical depression is to surround yourself with friends.\nPeople who have never faced a disorder like depression may not truly know what you're going through, and that might create a fundamental disconnect.\nYour friends may well not know or understand what kind of help you need, and that's OK.\nHere are five ways your friends might be worsening your depression.\nFriends who can deal with that \u2014 and all the other changes and choices listed above \u2014 are friends worth sticking with.", "timescraped": 1513838422.157711, "category": {"words": 1494, "personal": 16, "thirdperson": 30, "condition": 10, "recovery": 1}}, "3f2d7c230b57fdad055ed1577b2cae4a": {"title": "Bustle", "image": "https://cdn.bustle.com/bustle/production/public/favicon-9dff06.ico", "text": "22 Christmas Song Lyrics That Make Perfect Instagram Captions\n\nIf your favorite Christmas carol hasn't been stuck in your head all season, then you really lucked out.

Everyday situations that other people don't think twice about can make you sweat and give you heart palpitations, and experiences that most people might consider to be slightly stressful can give you a full-on panic attack. Your emotional and physical symptoms can control your life, dictating everything from what you do to where you go. And unfortunately for those of us who are hoping to find love, anxiety can affect your love life.\n\nI've dealt with anxiety for as long as I can remember, and while my symptoms aren't nearly as severe as those of a lot of people I know, the disorder has still made dating a challenge. A couple people I've dated have seen my panic attacks and thought that I was just being \"dramatic,\" and a couple more have actually used my anxiety to try to control and manipulate me. Luckily, I've since upgraded, and my current partner has been nothing but helpful and supportive in my battle against anxiety and its pesky cousin, depression. But that doesn't mean my anxiety has simply stopped affecting my love life.\n\nIf you have anxiety and are trying to get into or maintain a relationship or just an active sex life, you've probably dealt with a lot of difficulties that many people with anxiety struggle through. It can be frustrating, and even enraging at times, but somewhere out there is a person who isn't just willing to tolerate your anxiety, but also help you through it as your mental health sidekick. Just remember that if you find yourself dealing with any of these anxiety-related dating woes, you're definitely not alone.\n\n1. Lots Of Date Ideas Are Off-Limits\n\nZero people are going to blame you if you turn down your romantic interest's suggestion of going skydiving on the first date. But lots of situations that are no big deal to most people can cause a serious rush of adrenaline for someone with anxiety. Trying out that interesting new Indian restaurant in town? Ha, like I'd ever put myself in a situation where the waiter could laugh at me for mispronouncing the name of a food. Going out for a drink on a Friday night? Thanks, but people would probably touch or bump into me by accident, and quite frankly, nope.\n\n\n\n2. It's Hard To Find Someone Who Actually Comprehends It\n\nThe National Institute of Mental Health reports that up to 18 percent of adults in the United States live with an anxiety disorder, with up to 23 percent of those cases being classified as \"severe.\" This makes it one of the most common mental illnesses around, and yet, it's still massively misunderstood and stigmatized But even worse than someone who doesn't want to deal with your anxiety is someone who seriously just does. not. get it. They'll say things like, \"I have anxiety, too! My heart pounds a little faster right before a potentially life-changing job interview,\" or, \"I totally know what you're going through. I start sweating every time I have to walk through a sketchy neighborhood at 3 a.m.\"\n\nLots of folks don't understand that having your mind and body respond appropriately to scary situations is not the same as freaking out over an everyday situation that shouldn't be terrifying. It's pretty much a miracle when you either find someone who actually gets what you're going through or is willing to do their best to understand your anxiety and how it impacts your life.\n\n\n\n3. Starting To Talk To Someone New Is Basically Hell On Earth\n\nOnce you've been dating someone for a while, you generally know enough about them to figure out if they just fell asleep in the middle of texting or if they actually decided that they hate you mid-conversation. When you're talking to someone new, though, everything they do is enough to make your heart rate go up. Did they really think your joke was funny? Or are they secretly praying for this date to come to an early end because your attempts at humor are so pathetic? No smiley face emoji at the end of their \"Talk to you later!\" message? Even if all the signs point to your new love interest genuinely enjoying your company, your anxiety will twist everything it can into convincing you that they're just talking to you and spending time with you because they pity you.\n\n\n\n4. You're Constantly Wondering When Your Relationship Is Going To Come Crashing Down\n\nYou know that sense of dread you get during that part in a horror movie when all the main characters are happy and not being murdered? It's awful because everything seems so great, and you want it to continue being great, but you know without a doubt that it's only a matter of time before things start to go horribly wrong. For those of us with anxiety, that's what it's like being in a happy relationship.\n\nIt's almost more comforting when things do start to go wrong, because your mind has spent so much time preparing for disaster that it's a relief to know that you're not crazy and the downfall of your relationship has really always been waiting just around the corner. Your worries become a self-fulfilling prophecy as your anxiety begins to affect your relationship for the worse, and it's like there's nothing you can do to stop it. The feeling you get when there's conflict in your relationship is a more vibrant form of anxiety that bursts into your mind and feels much more intense, but the kind you get when everything appears to be just fine is a slow-burning worry that sits in the back of your mind and wreaks a very subtle kind of havoc on your psyche.\n\n5. You Start To Believe Your S.O. Would Be Happier With Someone More \"Normal\"\n\nAll the paranoia, panic attacks, and physical health symptoms that plague you when you have anxiety can make you feel like you're sometimes less than human. But here's the thing: you're not some freak of nature. The Anxiety and Depression Association of America has found that women are 60 percent more likely than men to develop an anxiety disorder in their lifetime, so if you're dating a dude, it shouldn't be a big surprise if you have the disorder and he doesn't. However, despite the fact that your partner has happily stayed with you thus far and tried to help you through your anxiety, you might start to wonder if they're really as content in this relationship as they say they are. Maybe they're just sticking around because it's convenient... or worse, maybe you've accidentally manipulated them into thinking that everyone freaks out as often as you do. The rational side of you knows that your S.O. is well aware of what they sign up for every day when they decide to love you and not someone else, but there's always that voice of doubt that makes you wonder exactly when they're going to realize the \"mistake\" they made by dating you.\n\n6. Long-Distance Relationships Are Basically A No-Go\n\nIf your S.O. has stopped responding to your texts because they're lying dead in a ditch somewhere (which, according to your anxiety, is obviously what happened), it's going to be a lot harder to weep over their body screaming, \"I knew it!\" if they're hundreds and hundreds of miles away from you. Plus, when the person you're dating lives super far away, it makes it a lot easier for them to cheat on you with their five supermodel-hot friends that occasionally \"like\" their Facebook posts. There are people with anxiety who manage to carry on LDRs, but most of us couldn't handle the stress.\n\n\n\n7. It's Hard To Have A \"Healthy\" Fight\n\nWhat they said was, \"Babe, can you please remember to turn off the bathroom light from now on? We've talked about this before,\" but what you heard was, \"Your inability to perform a basic task is going to cause our electric bill to put us into debt. I can't believe I have to repeatedly say this to you, and the next time it happens, I'm probably going to break up with you.\" Cue panic attack. Suddenly, what was just supposed to be a simple discussion and maybe a minor argument has turned into you sobbing hysterically and your partner trying to figure out exactly what they said to trigger it. More intense arguments can be even worse. Knowing how to have a healthy argument is crucial to maintaining a happy relationship, but when you have anxiety, you can almost never manage to keep it together enough to allow your less cheerful discussions to be constructive.\n\n\n\n8. When A Relationship Ends, You Start To Believe That You're Simply Undateable\n\nI swear, every time one of my relationships ends for any reason, I can almost feel my anxiety doing a little dance inside me. Oh, wait. That's just my heart pounding through my chest over the prospect that nobody will ever love me again. Being single isn't bad by any means, but there's a big difference in riding solo because you want to and feeling like nobody will ever even want to touch you with a ten-foot pole for the rest of your life. Anxiety's ability to manipulate situations around you really makes breakups even harder than they already are. Even if you and your now ex-partner ended the relationship amicably because you just weren't right for each other, anxiety will make you feel like the real reason it ended is because of how generally horrible it is to even be in your presence. If it was a nastier breakup, or worse, if the other person simply ghosted on you, it will be a miracle if you're ever able to enter another relationship again.\n\n\n\n9. Your Level Of Clinginess Tends To Fall To One Extreme Or The Other\n\nHow do you react when your mind is telling you that your partner probably hates you, is probably going to die a horrible death very soon, or is probably doing some terrible stuff behind your back? Lots of people with anxiety take one of two dramatic routes, either becoming clingy and overly-loving in a desperate attempt to keep their S.O. happy, or becoming extremely distant and detached so they don't get hurt when the \"inevitable\" finally occurs. Neither option is exactly healthy, but when you have anxiety, you're pretty much accustomed to having your brain go too far to one side of the scale.\n\n\n\n10. You Risk Becoming Dependent On Your Partner For Things That Make You Anxious\n\nUnless you are a member of my immediate family, my best friend, or my partner, you will probably never hear my voice over the phone. I'm that person who takes 10 minutes just to dial the number of the pizza place, and even then I'll probably just give up and settle for a pizza chain that lets me order online. My S.O. is very understanding of my anxiety, even though he doesn't really understand my reasoning (\"What if I have to say 'What?' three times in a row because I can't hear them and then they refer to me as 'That F*cking Girl' for the rest of my existence?\"), and because he's a saint, he happily sacrifices himself and makes phone calls for me when they're absolutely necessary. If you think that's ridiculous, you're not alone \u2014 I hate that I now have an excuse to never face my fears like a big girl. We've been working on getting me to deal with my phone anxiety recently, mainly because neither of us want me to get stabbed and be more afraid to talk to the 911 operator than I am to die. But if you have anxiety, you start sliding on a slippery slope the moment your S.O. agrees to do something for you so you can avoid whatever triggers your anxiety.\n\n\n\nWant more of Bustle's Sex and Relationships coverage?

Unfortunately, there may be a few people in your life who let their misconceptions about mental health cloud their beliefs and behavior. Anxiety disorder is no exception to this rule. Despite the fact that anxiety affects 18 percent of American adults and it can seriously affect someone's quality of life if it goes untreated, it's still sometimes dismissed as nothing more than a person's penchant for being overly dramatic or a refusal to act \"mature\" or \"social.\"\n\n\n\nThe idea that, because mental health issues can't be seen, people must be making them up in some sort of desperate bid for attention, is a common and hurtful misconception. This one never ceases to baffle me, because it seems like there are plenty of ways to seek attention that would be significantly more enjoyable than feigning a panic attack. However, many misconceptions about anxiety disorder are not mean-spirited, just ignorant \u2014 and some actually come from a place of wanting to help someone who suffers from the disorder, but not knowing how.\n\n\n\nBut ignorance isn't an excuse; it's an opportunity to educate yourself. So read on and learn about seven misconceptions about people with anxiety that need to become a thing of the past \u2014 because they do a disservice to individuals who are struggling with, managing or trying to recover from the disorder:\n\n\n\n1. You Can Just Avoid Your Potential Triggers\n\nMost people with anxiety have specific triggers that bring on intense feelings of anxiety or even panic attacks. These can range from attending a social gatherings to driving to making a phone call. While many people get nervous before making a big presentation in front of a large group, individuals with anxiety often fear being called on in class or during a meeting. Regardless of what induces someone's anxiety, the solution is not to simply avoid it \u2014 and telling someone with anxiety to do that is more than bad advice; it's thoroughly unrealistic. Most of us don't have option of just avoiding whole chunks of life, even if they make us feel intensely unpleasant feelings.\n\n\n\nAvoiding all triggers will do more than just prevent the person from fully taking part in life \u2014 avoiding stressors will actually reinforce your anxiety and leave anxiety sufferers feeling helpless and paralyzed when you end up in a situation where avoidance isn't an option.\n\n\n\n2. People With Anxiety Should Just Have A Few Drinks To Take The Edge Off\n\nMany people with anxiety are told by friends to simply have a few glasses of wine to take the edge off. And yes, if your anxiety kicks in during the evening hours as you stress out about the next day, it's tempting to reach for a bottle. But while this can help in the moment, the long-term effects can be dangerous. A recent study found that 13 percent of respondents who consumed alcohol in the past year had done so to ease anxiety. The same study found that individuals with anxiety who self-medicated with alcohol or drugs were more likely to have their condition worsen.\n\n\n\nIt's generally fine to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner (although you should consult with your therapist or psychiatrist if you're concerned about your specific drinking habits), but alcohol should never be used as a quick fix for anxiety. Not only can it lead to addiction problems, but it can prevent people from seeking professional treatment or developing healthy coping mechanisms like yoga, calling a friend or writing in a journal.\n\n3. Anxiety Is Always Linked To A Specific Trauma\n\nA traumatic experience is usually not the cause of generalized anxiety or social anxiety disorder. PTSD is considered a type of anxiety disorder, but those symptoms are quite different than what's experienced by people with an anxiety condition that's rooted in genetics and brain chemistry.\n\n\n\nPeople with PTSD tend to suffer from anxiety that's directly related to the trauma they suffered \u2014 so their triggers are specific sounds, places, and smells that bring back terrifying memories. On the other hand, generalized anxiety disorder is caused by a combination of genetics, brain chemistry, and personality traits. People with generalized anxiety may feel extremely distressed about public speaking or meeting new people, despite never having a terrible experience with either scenario. So don't assume that people with anxiety disorders are necessarily coping with a past trauma.\n\n\n\n4. There Aren't Any Physical Symptoms\n\nWhen people say they are feeling physically ill due to anxiety, they're not imagining it. In fact, some of the hallmark symptoms of anxiety disorder are physical and they're a major sign that you're dealing with a disorder, not a normal case of nerves. Anxiety has so many physical side effects that the disorder is frequently mistaken for physical conditions including asthma, tachycardia, ulcers and heart problems. Physical symptoms include \u2014 but are not limited to \u2014 trouble breathing, heart palpitations, dizziness, nausea, and muscle tension. It's a vicious cycle, because your anxiety increases the moment you begin to struggle breathing or feel your heart racing.\n\n\n\n5. It's Helpful To Tell Someone To \"Calm Down\" Or \"Be Logical\"\n\n\n\nYou're not breaking news to someone struggling with anxiety when you tell them that their fears may be irrational. People with anxiety know that many of their fears are irrational and illogical. That's what makes it a mental health disorder, rather than a case of confusion \u2014 anxiety sufferers logically know that many of their fears have no base in reality, but their bodies and minds still react as if they did.\n\nIt's also a huge part of why anxiety is frustrating and difficult to explain to someone who has never experienced it. So when a person is struggling to breathe and keep it together, the last thing they need is someone telling them to just calm down and think this through logically. In the moment, these words can feel very dismissive and condescending.\n\n\n\n6. Nothing Can Help A Person During An Anxiety Attack\n\nFlippantly telling someone to \"calm down\" is unhelpful \u2014 but that doesn't mean you can't help someone who's having an anxiety attack. If you have a loved one who is suffering from anxiety, it's a good idea to have a talk about how you can help the next time they're in the throes of an attack. But, in general, some helpful anxiety attack coping tactics include anything that will get them out of their head and focusing on \"the here and now\". Remind them to take deep breaths \u2014 and do the breathing exercises with them. It's also helpful to ask them to look around and name what they see, or ask them to describe the details of a beloved place or memory.\n\n\n\n7. People With Anxiety Are Just Illogical And Unreasonable\n\nFirst of all, people with anxiety generally recognize that many of their particular fears are illogical \u2014 and they spend a lot of time reminding themselves of it. But, that aside, suffering from anxiety and the irrational fears that accompany the disorder doesn't make a person unintelligent, incompetent or unreliable. Like any other physical or mental illness, anxiety can affect your ability to function if it goes untreated. But people with anxiety are no less capable and competent than anyone else in the workplace, at school or in any other area of life.\n\nAnxiety sufferers don't have to let anxiety control their lives \u2014 and the support of loved ones really helps. And when we educate ourselves about anxiety, we're in an infinitely better position to help a loved one who is suffering \u2014 whether it means supporting them through a tough episode or giving them the encouragement they need to see a therapist. We're also destigmatizing the disorder for them, and all other sufferers past, present and future.\n\n\n\nImages: Pexels; Giphy (7)\n\n", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/110773-7-myths-about-anxiety-disorder", "summary": "Anxiety Is Always Linked To A Specific TraumaA traumatic experience is usually not the cause of generalized anxiety or social anxiety disorder.\nPTSD is considered a type of anxiety disorder, but those symptoms are quite different than what's experienced by people with an anxiety condition that's rooted in genetics and brain chemistry.\nOn the other hand, generalized anxiety disorder is caused by a combination of genetics, brain chemistry, and personality traits.\nIn fact, some of the hallmark symptoms of anxiety disorder are physical and they're a major sign that you're dealing with a disorder, not a normal case of nerves.\nAnxiety sufferers don't have to let anxiety control their lives \u2014 and the support of loved ones really helps.", "timescraped": 1513838426.240109, "category": {"words": 1344, "personal": 5, "thirdperson": 33, "condition": 44, "recovery": 1}}, "276216b77dd3fa978a059284319fba98": {"title": "To The People Who Mistake My Social Anxiety For Rudeness: Here's What's Really Happening", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/2017/1/19/826c1147-13eb-40af-9394-173efb5ed36e.jpg?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "text": "One of my friends recently told me that she thought I hated her when we first met. Hate?! That's a strong word, I thought to myself. I laughed it off with her in the moment, but later that evening, I anxiously thought her comment over. I know I don't give the most amicable first impression, but I never thought of myself as standoffish. After talking it over with some close friends and family (and a therapist), though, I learned that my anxious habits can make me appear distant, unattached, and even inhospitable at times.\n\nI've got social anxiety, and the area I struggle most with is meeting people for the first time. I build up the moment in my head to an Olympic degree and convince myself that this stranger is going to witness all my shortcomings right off the bat \u2014 and immediately not like me as a result. I put up my defenses because I don't want to get hurt first. Unfortunately, the insecurity, self-doubt, and low self-esteem that my anxiety brings to the surface translates easily into indifference. At parties, people think I'm impolite or, worse, tedious.\n\nI'd like to set the record straight, because I think there are a lot of other anxiety-ridden people out there who deal with the same misunderstandings. Here's what's actually happening when my anxiety makes me seem unfriendly.\n\nIf I'm Not Very Friendly When We First Meet, It's Only Because I'm Very Insecure\n\nAnxiety and insecurity go together like macaroni and cheese. When there's a lot of anxiety on our shoulders, we automatically feel scared that people will judge us for everything, from what we wear to how our hair smells.\n\nI only realized this in the past year, but my overwhelming anxiety can cause me to be quite cold to people when we're first introduced. All I can think about is all the things they won't like about me \u2014 the high-pitched sound of my voice, my handshake being too firm, my annoying laugh. So when we meet for the first time and I'm not a fountain of smiles, please understand that I'm not blowing you off. I'm just putting up a defense mechanism.\n\nI Have A Hard Time Sharing Personal Information About Myself With Strangers\n\nI've been at dinners where multiple people are meeting for the first time, willingly exchanging details about their lives with one another. They talk about their jobs, their love lives, and their recent home renovations. I wish I could easily offer up that information myself, but my anxiety often chokes me up. It may seem like I don't want to participate in the conversation, but it's not that I don't want to. It's just that I'm afraid to open up, especially to people I don't know.\n\nIt all stems from my fear of intimacy, which is a common side effect of anxiety. So don't be alarmed if you see me freeze up or clumsily exit the room when someone starts asking me personal questions. I know they're just trying to be nice, and that they're only asking the most basic things, but if I'm not feel fully prepared for it, I sometimes feel the need to remove myself.\n\nIf I Don't Laugh, It's Probably Not Because I Don't Think You're Funny\n\nLaughing is a great way to break the ice, but if I'm feeling tightly wound from all the nerves, I might miss out on a few of the jokes that are being tossed around. Because of my social anxiety, I get so freaked out that I'll say or do the wrong thing that I often fall out of the present moment and fail to catch onto the surrounding humor. I might also feel so uncomfortable with everything that's happening that I don't feel like I have permission to laugh with abandon. It doesn't mean you're not funny (you probably are very funny, in fact), and it doesn't mean I'm a poor sport. I'm just trying to play my cards right so I don't make a fool out of myself.\n\nIf I Back Out Of Plans At The Last Minute, It Doesn't Mean I Don't Care\n\nA devastatingly common symptom of social anxiety is refusing to show up to certain events because you're afraid to be the center of attention, or you're just not feeling strong enough to face a group of people. I've had to cancel numerous dinners and get-togethers because my anxiety had other ideas in mind. It may sound ridiculous to people who have never suffered from a mental illness, but it can feel impossible to put eye shadow on and go meet people in a crowded bar when you're feeling emotionally exhausted. No matter how far in advance I've made the plans, there simply comes a time when I hit a wall, and my time is better spent at home, eating a warm meal and enjoying the silence.\n\nWhen I'm Awkward With Your Friends, It's Because I'm Nervous They Won't Like Me\n\nMeeting my friends' friends is one of the most stressful things on the planet. It's almost as bad as all those standardized tests I had to take in high school. I love my friends, so I want the people in their life to take a liking to me. But you know by now that I'm not great with first impressions, so I may be a little awkward with your crew when we're introduced for the first time.\n\nMy anxiety makes me feel like I have to live up to a lot of expectations, particularly if these are people who mean a lot to my friends. I make myself believe I have to put my best foot forward, which puts unnecessary pressure on me. In turn, I get really jumpy and I doubt myself. Don't be surprised if I say a few awkward things or come off as reserved.\n\nIf I'm Quiet, It's Not Because I'm Mad At You\n\nMe trying to express how I feel: idk I just feel like...idk...idk...idk man. Nvm I'm good. \u2014 anxiety (@glovisual) January 19, 2017\n\nTalking, in general, is a difficult task when anxiety hits you hard. When I feel triggered, the first thing I do is shut down. I don't want to speak to anyone. I don't have the energy to carry on small talk. I wish people would understand that, so if they happen to approach me when I'm internally battling anxiety, they would know that my silence doesn't reflect on them at all. Rather, it's a product of the hectic reel of thoughts in my head. Being quiet and steering clear of social interactions just feels like the only way to handle the madness.\n\nPlease be understanding when I just don't have very much to say in a conversation. Let me take care of myself and get back on track, and then I'm sure I'll be back to my chatty self. Eventually.

And it's important to remember that there's a wide variety of anxiety disorders that people struggle with, from post-traumatic stress disorder to general anxiety disorder to specific phobias and obsessive-compulsive disorder.\n\nUnfortunately, when it comes to explaining the concept of anxiety disorders to the uninitiated, that variety \u2014 and some common misunderstandings about what \"anxiety\" really means in its disordered state \u2013 can confuse some well-meaning but ill-informed people. If you need some guidance regarding how to let friends or family into the realities of your anxiety condition, the tips below may help.\n\nYou may not be able to communicate the details of your disorder if you don't fully understand them yourself, so the first step to educating others is to get educated. Is your particular experience common to the disorder? What treatment is available? Do you have specific anxiety triggers, and if so, do you know what they are?\n\nOf course, you may not feel like being the information bureau about this particular issue for your friends and family, which is a wholly legitimate and understandable way to feel. If that's the case, you may want to direct them to some sources of information that can explain it further. The mental health organization Mind and the National Institute of Mental Health both have good resources that get into the nitty-gritty in intelligible ways.\n\nBut if you do want to try to help the people in your life who do not have anxiety disorders to try to better understand your experience, here are a few tips for explaining anxiety to people without much experience of it as a serious problem. Good luck, my friend.\n\n1. It's Not Just About \"Worrying\"\n\n\"Anxiety\" seems like a rather benign word on its own; people can say they're anxious about job interviews, flying, a second date, or other innocuous situations, and what they mean is that they're anticipating difficulty and fearful of certain consequences, but likely prepared to go through with it anyway. A little of that kind of anxiety is a natural part of life.\n\nBut an anxiety disorder is very different, as it's as if those basic impulses mushroom out of the realm of rational worry into something more complicated and uncontrollable.\n\nPeople with an acute form of anxiety (like, say, acute social anxiety \u2014 a disorder where every social interaction is fraught with fear of disaster and the potential for paralytic terror) often come up against the idea that anxiety is just \"worry;\" in other words, that it's something that could be controlled if they would just \"calm down\" and \"stop working yourself up.\" The thing to emphasize when explaining your experience is that, generally, anxiety is not a choice. Experiencing anxiety can feel like a tripwire in your brain has gone off, leaving you without access to certain calmer ways of reacting to a problem. The highway has no turn-offs.\n\n2. Just Because A Worry Is \"Irrational\" Doesn't Mean It Does Not Hold Power\n\nOne of the most difficult things to explain about certain types of mental health disorders, like anxiety, is that even though the mental processes behind them are not rational, that doesn't reduce the power of the thoughts they create in any way at all. A thought process that definitely has no basis in reality (for instance, the idea that if you don't close your door three times, terrible things will happen to those you love, or that somebody hates you because you said \"you too\" when they wished you a happy birthday) still holds power, even if you rationally understand that it shouldn't.\n\nA good way to explain this can be to divide your brain into two parts: the rational bit and the primitive, lizard bit \u2014 this latter bit is the part that triggers primal panic responses. The rational brain may very well understand that the concept or situation you're dealing with isn't actually terrifying; but the lizard brain isn't listening, and will take a lot of convincing before it stops shouting through a megaphone and deafening the rational brain with its power.\n\n3. A Panic Attack Feels Dangerous, Even If It Isn't\n\nThe feeling of a panic attack can be quite spectacularly difficult to explain to anybody who hasn't experienced one. You could try to focus on explaining the physical aspects, if the mental bit is tricky or upsetting for you to get into: the paralytic muscles, the racing heart, the feeling of possible death. It's a serious experience and should be taken seriously. Emily McClure over at SimpleMost describes the feeling of normal anxiety as \"running a race without ever leaving your seat,\" and that's a good place to start; but the overwhelming nature of paralytic fear can be trickier to communicate. Relating it to their most extreme fears or phobias may be a good way to try to reach some kind of common ground.\n\n4. PTSD Is Not Only For Soldiers\n\n\n\n\n\nA common misconception about post-traumatic stress disorder: that it's only really a \"thing\" for people who've seen action in combat. PTSD is actually a disorder that can occur in reaction to a huge range of traumas, from sexual assault to abuse, and it can have many varied ways of showing itself.\n\nMany people will make assumptions about a PTSD sufferer, so it's important to keep that in mind while explaining the condition: everybody's triggers are different , and when they're set off, it's rather like a firework in your head that can't possibly be shut off or kept quiet, even if your reactions are minute or very short-lived. I react very badly to loud noises; another friend with the condition can't deal with enclosed spaces. The notion of \"slipping back\" \u2014 of a piece of stimulus putting your body back into the situation of trauma just for a second like a terrible time machine \u2014 might help make it clearer to the person that you're speaking with.\n\n5. It Can Feel Like You're Anticipating Danger All The Time\n\nAnxiety disorders typically involve a disordered view of threats in the world. If you suffer from an anxiety disorder, it may feel like threats to your physical and mental safety are frequently present but you may not be able to see them right away; you may not know when they're going to turn up, and feel like you have no mechanism for predicting them. It's like being in a hair-trigger environment. The adrenal fight or flight response is, in this situation, always close to the surface, and the mind truly believes it's the safest way to protect itself.\n\n\n\nThe feeling that there is looming danger that we're not readily prepared to handle is the unifying theme in anxiety disorders. Obsessive compulsive sufferers may develop particular rituals and patterns to \"protect against\" or \"neutralize\" these threats; people may experience panic attacks or serious terror in reaction to them; others may feel constant levels of anxiety all the time; and still others will associate certain innocuous events with deeply troubling things and want to escape them immediately. But no matter what your particular situation is, this feeling of danger remains a theme across anxiety disorder: some part of the brain of the anxiety disorder sufferer is convinced (possibly because of past events) that particular situations are hugely, horribly threatening \u2014 and that part of the brain begins strategizing about how to stay safe, even when its ideas of safety and danger don't necessarily square with the reality of what is going on around you.\n\nThough you may not want to explain life with an anxiety disorder as a giant game of Call of Duty, many people who have never dealt with anxiety disorder don't understand that it is about a sense of danger that feels very real, even if it isn't. Letting them into this reality \u2014 even just a bit \u2014 may help them better support you.\n\nImages: Stocksy, Gemeentearchief Amsterdam, Wellcome Trust, All Detective Magazine, John Hamilton Mortimer, Nationaal Archief Netherlands/Wikimedia Commons", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/159599-how-to-explain-anxiety-to-people-who-dont-understand", "summary": "If you have an anxiety disorder, know that you're not alone: the Anxiety Disorders Association Of America reports that anxiety disorder is the most common mental health condition in America, affecting around 18 percent of the entire population.\nAnd it's important to remember that there's a wide variety of anxiety disorders that people struggle with, from post-traumatic stress disorder to general anxiety disorder to specific phobias and obsessive-compulsive disorder.\nUnfortunately, when it comes to explaining the concept of anxiety disorders to the uninitiated, that variety \u2014 and some common misunderstandings about what \"anxiety\" really means in its disordered state \u2013 can confuse some well-meaning but ill-informed people.\nThe feeling that there is looming danger that we're not readily prepared to handle is the unifying theme in anxiety disorders.\nThough you may not want to explain life with an anxiety disorder as a giant game of Call of Duty, many people who have never dealt with anxiety disorder don't understand that it is about a sense of danger that feels very real, even if it isn't.", "timescraped": 1513838428.8678331, "category": {"words": 1384, "personal": 2, "thirdperson": 17, "condition": 33, "recovery": 0}}, "f9ecd9f24c735e7689fae814d3f6b541": {"title": "This Teen's Bullet Journal For Tracking Mental Health Is Going Viral & Everyone Is Following Suit", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/2017/2/10/c4d41e9f-a4b3-44b3-b66b-612db2787567.png?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "text": "While there are plenty of ways people can and should keep track of their mental health, some methods can become overwhelming \u2014 even something as simple as writing in a journal can seem like too difficult a task, and it's all too easy to abandon it and feel even worse for \"failing\" at something. Enter this teen's marvelous idea to use a bullet journal to track mental health, which is simple, efficient, and actually much more telling of the fluctuations in mental health than a lot of other comparable methods.\n\nIf you're new to the bullet journal system, it's fairly simple: it involves making daily, monthly, and future logs with a series of symbols to remind yourself of important tasks and scheduled appointments, and has been heralded for its efficiency and ease. While it's great for keeping track of your life in general, 16-year-old Kyra Bailey hacked the system by making her own color codes to track her general state from day-to-day, ranging from red on \"amazing, fantastic\" days to purple on \"depressed, sad\" days to green for \"sick\" days. Her 21-year-old brother Markale Bailey recently walked in and saw her bullet journal tacked on the wall and thought the idea was so innovative that he tweeted it out for his followers to gain inspiration from, where it has since gone viral. (Bustle has reached out to Kyra and Markale for comment, and will update upon reply.)\n\nWalked in my sister room and saw this....... pic.twitter.com/O0JbvkaI1s \u2014 Saint Pablo (@TheLifeOfKale) February 2, 2017\n\n\"My sister is a very creative human being,\" said Markale to BuzzFeed News. \"I wanted to show the people on Twitter how creative Kyra is and ... hopefully inspire other people to keep a tracker of themselves of their lives also or something similar.\"\n\nSince Markale shared it, a lot of Twitter users have responded expressing their enthusiasm for the idea, saying that they might try it themselves. The low commitment and ease of it make it all the more practical for people who might be struggling with mental health issues to feel motivated to keep it up, and it could prove an invaluable resource when talking to a mental health professionals about possible coping strategies or treatment plans.\n\n@TheLifeOfKale tell your sister I said thank you for the idea \u2014 Ty (@tythagemini) February 2, 2017\n\n@TheLifeOfKale i'm making this for my kids. \u2764\ufe0f \u2014 Veronica (@ginnyk1) February 7, 2017\n\nKyra told BuzzFeed News she was initially inspired by an Instagram about doing \"your year in pixels,\" which went viral on Pinterest after blogger Camille Babarit created it. And while initially Kyra thought she would forget to keep it up, so far she's been going strong: \"Using the tracker really helps my mental health, it makes me feel like every day I'm a new person,\" she told BuzzFeed News.\n\nIf you're not confident in your ability to measure out rows and columns as pin straight as Kyra's, you can always open a new Excel doc and print it from there to make your own version of this. Thirty-one rows and 12 columns will get you through a year, and at the end of it, you'll have an easily managed, clear visual of the progress of your mental health.\n\nAnd if you're looking for more tips on bullet journaling, this video can get you started.\n\nBullet Journal on YouTube\n\nHere's to a happier, healthier, and decidedly more color coded 2017!", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/p/this-teens-bullet-journal-for-tracking-mental-health-is-going-viral-everyone-is-following-suit-37111", "summary": "Enter this teen's marvelous idea to use a bullet journal to track mental health, which is simple, efficient, and actually much more telling of the fluctuations in mental health than a lot of other comparable methods.\nThe low commitment and ease of it make it all the more practical for people who might be struggling with mental health issues to feel motivated to keep it up, and it could prove an invaluable resource when talking to a mental health professionals about possible coping strategies or treatment plans.\nThirty-one rows and 12 columns will get you through a year, and at the end of it, you'll have an easily managed, clear visual of the progress of your mental health.\nAnd if you're looking for more tips on bullet journaling, this video can get you started.\nBullet Journal on YouTubeHere's to a happier, healthier, and decidedly more color coded 2017!", "timescraped": 1513838408.152997, "category": {"words": 574, "personal": 4, "thirdperson": 14, "condition": 7, "recovery": 0}}, "05ce1abc47dbad64c1adc49b9a5b207e": {"title": "42 Inspiring \"My Tips For Mental Health\" Tweets For When You Need A Bit Of Reassurance", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/uploads/image/2017/9/25/8850ade4-d12b-4ae3-b568-9a24ec323df4-allef-vinicius-189083-copy.jpg?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "text": "The choice of how to deal with your mental health issues is extremely personal and varied. What works for one person may not work for another. Unfortunately, taking care of your mental health isn't a topic that's often discussed. But, people are taking action to change that on Twitter right now. While you may have started to associate Twitter as the land of Trump, some things that come out of the social media site are incredibly beneficial. Take the trending hashtag #MyTipsForMentalHealth for instance. Filled with users sharing empowering messages to those struggling with mental health issues, as well as explaining how they cope, it's an inspiring display of love and support.\n\nEven more importantly, #MyTipsForMentalHealth creates a way for people to candidly discuss mental health, something that is not done nearly enough. Since you can't see mental health, so many still find ways to wrongly dismiss its existence. Mental health may still face an incredible stigma but the fact that these users took the time to show that you are never alone in your fight could have a life-changing effect.\n\nMovements, such as this hashtag, can also be instrumental in helping people determine that their struggles are something more and thus identify ways to seek treatment. So often, people deal with mental health issues for too long a time without even realizing what's happening. It took me 20 years of panic attacks and anxiety to discover that I have a panic disorder. For years I tore myself apart at how weak I was being in a given situation, hating how I let things get to me. At the worst, I genuinely thought I was going to die while facing a panic attack, having no way to define what it was that I was experiencing.\n\nIt's been almost a year to the day since I learned what I was dealing with and went on medication. The person I was then would barely recognize the person I am now, but that doesn't mean every day is a walk in the park. Instead it means I've learned what coping mechanisms are most effective for me and, when my panic disorder acts up, I have the knowledge that I can survive it.\n\nI still have days where I can feel each piece of negativity right on the edge of my consciousness, and I do everything I can to fight back against it. Luckily resources and conversations around mental health are becoming increasingly common, just as we see through #MyTipsForMentalHealth. \"Prioritizing your own mental health is finally starting to come out of the closet as a way to experience greater success, more friendships, stronger relationships and promote vitality,\" Dorian Crawford, PsyD tells Bustle. \"When we understand what is going on inside, we can make choices and changes that will be noticeable on the outside. If we do not take care of ourselves, we cannot expect to be strong for others when they need us.\"\n\nIf you are struggling with your mental health or want to learn how to better be there for those that are, the best step to take is educating yourself on the various ways to help the situation.

How do you admit to someone else that there are days when you can't even bring yourself to get out of bed? How do you explain to the people in your life that sometimes, even the idea of taking a shower or leaving the house feels like an impossible task? Because there is so much cultural stigma attached to mental illness, talking about it can feel embarrassing and shameful. So a lot of the time, it can feel like it's easier to just keep it a secret. But it\u2019s time we changed that.\n\nSometimes, you might prefer to keep details to your mental illness to yourself, restricting mentions of your mental health status to private conversations with your doctor, your partner, or your best friend whom you trust. But sometimes, what you need is to live openly, as someone who doesn\u2019t have to hide the side of them that struggles.\n\nSo if you\u2019re ready to start being upfront about your mental illness, here are six things to consider:\n\n1. Tell Yourself First\n\nGet comfortable with your own story. Figure out how you feel about what you\u2019ve been through, and what it might sound like if you were going to explain it to someone else. Feeling familiar with the ins and outs of your own journey will allow you to share it with others without feeling super uncomfortable.\n\nThe first time I opened up about my depression to someone outside of my immediate bubble, I did it as a semi-joke. We were trading funny stories from our respective college days, of the classes we skipped and the assignments we wrote at the last possible second on books we hadn't actually read, and how unbelievable it was that we were so nonchalant about it. \"It probably didn't help that I was really depressed for most of that year,\" I said, with a laugh. But as soon as it came out, I felt relief. I was depressed that year. I was a person who was clinically depressed. It was the first time I hadn't conveniently omitted that fact when discussing my college days, and it felt surprisingly good to say it out loud.\n\nNow, I'm able to talk about that time much more honestly. I realize now that I should have been medicated, I should have been in therapy \u2014 I needed help and yet the resources weren't accessible to me. I realize now that so many people go away to school and struggle with their mental health. But I probably wouldn't have been able to come to terms with my own experience if I hadn't started talking about it.\n\n2. Figure Out Your Boundaries\n\nJust because you\u2019re choosing to share, doesn\u2019t mean you have to tell everyone everything. Decide ahead of time what (if anything) you want to leave out. Will you talk about your treatment? Your current well-being? The fact that you backed out of girls\u2019 night last week because you felt like the entire world was ending? To some people, being open means saying, \u201cLast year, I tried to kill myself.\u201d To others, \u201cI\u2019ve struggled with depression in the past\u201d feels like enough.\n\nKeep in mind that your boundaries could change as you become more open to talking about your experience. I started out telling only close friends that \"sometimes I feel really down\". These days, I'm more than happy to explain to almost anyone how therapy and medication saved my life, and that there's no shame in giving it a try. The more I shared some details of my own struggle, the easier it became to share others, and the less I worried about what other people thought. In my head, the idea of taking antidepressants seemed embarrassing, but when I started to say it out loud, it started to make a lot of sense. Why wouldn't I try medication that could help me feel better? What's wrong with taking steps to be healthier and happier? There's absolutely no need to share any more than you feel comfortable with, but eventually, you might find you don't have to feel uncomfortable about any of it.\n\n3. Start By Talking With Your Support Network\n\nBeing honest about having a mental illness can be difficult, because not everyone will be understanding about it. If you aren\u2019t used to talking about it, start with the people who you know will be. It\u2019s important to be realistic \u2014 maybe you really want to tell your brother or your best friend from college whom you haven\u2019t seen in a few years, but they might not be the ones who will be able to support you the way you need it right now. Identifying the people in your life who are compassionate and loving and supportive is helpful for lots of reasons, but if you\u2019re going to start putting your whole self out there, you\u2019re going to want to do it with people who are going to be glad that you did.\n\nIf you're unsure of whether or not to open up to someone in your life, try to imagine what they'd say. Will they hug you? Tell you how awesome you are? Tell you that they are there for you anytime you need it? Then they are your support network. Will they seem confused and try to give you advice, or tell you to think happy thoughts and that it's all in your head? NOT your support network. Move along.\n\n4. Don't Apologize\n\nThe stigma surrounding mental illness can give the impression that talking openly about struggling is something that we shouldn\u2019t do. It makes us feel ashamed, and it can feel like we are making other people feel uncomfortable. What if the person we're talking to doesn't know what to say? Am I going to sound like a total downer? A drama queen? Are they going to forever treat me like someone who could fall apart into a mess of tears and suicide attempts if I admit that once my depression got so bad, I thought about how much easier it'd be if I didn't exist? But here's the thing: you do not need to apologize for your feelings. You do not need to apologize for being a human being who has a difficult time sometimes. By being honest about who you are and how you feel, you are helping yourself (because the only thing worse than having a mental illness is feeling guilty for having a mental illness). You are also indirectly helping everyone else around you who needs to hear that they aren\u2019t the only one going through something awful. In fact, you'd be surprised at how many people admit their own struggle once they realize you'll understand. I never realized how many people in my life are in therapy, are on medication, have OCD or panic attacks or bipolar disorder and who have been hospitalized for those things, until I started sharing my own experience. It's easy to feel like other people won't understand where you're coming from, but chances are you probably have more in common than you think.\n\n5. Recognize That Some (Or A Lot) Of Responses Won\u2019t Be Helpful\n\nMost people aren\u2019t good at knowing what to say when the topic of mental illness comes up. Usually, they don\u2019t want to be hurtful or a jerk, so they say stupid things that still end up feeling hurtful anyway. They'll say things you really don't need them to say, like \"It's not so bad\", or \"It will pass\", or anything that starts with \"but\" (\"But you have a great job/a loving relationship/a nice place to live/a really cute dog/whatever else that looks good from the outside and is supposed to insulate you from feeling sad/overwhelmed/dead inside\"). I once had someone lecture me on the Law of Attraction, which claims that we create our reality through our thoughts \u2014 which was basically just another way of saying \"by the way, it's totally your own fault that you're depressed because you're choosing to think about bad things.\" Oh, thanks!\n\nBeing on the receiving end of bad advice might not be entirely avoidable. But it does help to remember that these comments aren't about you. They're about being part of a society that doesn\u2019t know how to handle conversations about mental illness. They're about misinformation. They're about not realizing that all humans really need from one another is empathy and connection. But it\u2019s going to be up to you to find a way to not take any of it personally.\n\n6. Remember Who You Are\n\nBeing a person with a mental illness is not fun. It is very hard, and exhausting, and stressful for both yourself and the people who love you. But your mental illness is just one aspect of your life. It is not who you are.\n\nYou can have a mental illness and still enjoy life. You can still have meaningful relationships. You can still have a career. You can still do things that matter. You can still have hopes and dreams and goals, and things worth celebrating.\n\nSharing your story won\u2019t take away from that. If anything, it just might show the world that people with depression, anxiety, mood disorders, and schizophrenia, people on medication, people in therapy, or anyone else who ever struggles with their mind sometimes, can still be awesome, wonderful, happy people who matter just as much as everyone else.\n\nImages: Lee J.

Whatever you're imagining, it's probably more extreme than many of the actual signs that indicate that you're dealing with serious mental health issues that need professional care. People often neglect their brains far longer than they would their bodies if they were in a similar state of pain or distress, sometimes because they're afraid of being labeled \"crazy\" or of being put on medication; but the reality is that mental health problems, if left untreated, can cause quite serious havoc, or even danger, to your life. So if you're struggling with any of the symptoms below \u2014 or any other mental health symptoms that feel hard to deal with \u2014 it's always worth finding a sympathetic medical professional who can answer your questions and guide you towards treatment.\n\nIf you're experiencing mental health distress but are not able to get to a doctor, contact a mental health hotline, like the National Alliance on Mental illness is at 800-950-6264, Mental Health American is at 800-969-6642, or the Panic Disorder Information Hotline is at 800-64-PANIC. You can also try local hotlines affiliated with medical centers in your area. But no matter what choice you go with, investigate all your options for finding professional diagnosis and help; this isn't a situation where you should rely on social media for information or self-diagnose with WebMD.\n\nAnd if you have experienced any suicidal or self-harming thoughts, seek help from a helpline, a friend or family member you trust, or a mental health professional immediately. You can call the National Suicide Prevention Hotline any time at 1-800-273-8255 (1-800-273-TALK), or contact the American Society for Suicide Prevention website for support via phone or chat. You can also find resources to help keep yourself safe right now at websites like The HopeLine.\n\nIf any of these nine mental health symptoms below are occurring in your life, please get in contact with a doctor or mental health professional who can help \u2014 and remember that treatment, help, and hope are available.\n\n1. Suicidal Thoughts\n\nThis is a Big Deal. If you're having thoughts about self-harm or suicide \u2014 even if you think of them as \"unserious\" ramblings or the odd bit of panicked 3 a.m. irrationality \u2014 you need to talk to a professional as soon as possible. Perhaps you argue to yourself that you have \"no real intention\" of killing yourself, or don't want to \"alarm people,\" but the impulse is a concerning one and definitely deserves professional attention. It can indicate serious unhappiness, a trapped feeling, hopelessness, self-punishment, a reaction to severe stress or other factors of mental health that need assessment and treatment. Please don't try to deal with this on your own.\n\n\n\n2. Paranoia\n\nThis can be a difficult one to see when it is happening to you, as our thoughts tend to feel reasonable to us; this is why increased paranoia may first be noticed by friends or family , rather than the person experiencing it. But if you've increasingly begun to feel that you're being followed, your communications are being monitored, unknown people are trying to hurt you, people whom you know aren't who they say they are, or that there's an element of conspiracy in your environment (and you aren't a spy or involved in some kind of criminal enterprise), you may want to talk to somebody. Paranoia doesn't automatically mean you're experiencing schizophrenia or a similar disorder; it can be part of a delusional disorder or serious anxiety. But no matter what its roots, it needs to be checked if it's actively impeding your life and causing you serious fear.\n\n3. Hallucinations\n\nIf you're on medication that might cause hallucinations, then this isn't necessarily a symptom to freak out about; but if there's no clear reason for you to be seeing, hearing, or otherwise experiencing things that aren't there, raise this issue with a medical professional.\n\nThere are several different factors that can cause people to experiencing hallucinations like hearing voices or seeing visions, which range from loss of vision, to a bad reaction to an illegal drug, to potential brain issues like epilepsy or migraines; they've also been experienced by people in solitary confinement or leading very solitary lives. No matter what the cause, they are a very clear sign that your brain's signaling isn't operating as it should, and you deserve to go get examined to make sure that you are healthy (even if the hallucinations are pleasant and not intruding on your life).\n\n4. Serious Lack Of Motivation\n\nPeople often believe that depression is all about sadness, but it's actually a far wider-ranging psychological condition that encompasses a lot of different behaviors and symptoms. One of the most marked symptoms is a change in your levels of motivation: generally, severely depressed people are unable to motivate themselves to do anything , from getting out of bed to doing the most basic activities of self-care (like showering). Severely depressed people will often tell concerned friends that they're avoiding these activities because \"there's no point\" or \"they don't deserve it.\" We're not talking about the occasional bout of boredom or lack of forward momentum on a Sunday afternoon; if your lack of motivation is preventing you from living an ordinary life, seeing friends, doing a job or maintaining your own health, then get yourself to a GP.\n\n5. Behavior Demonstrating Self-Hatred Or Destructiveness\n\nAgain, this pattern may not be evident to you until somebody who cares about you points it out. But if you're indulging in behavior involving serious risk, self-harm, destruction or self-sabotage, it would probably be valuable for you to seek psychological aid to figure out why. In this category I'm including all kinds of potential destructive actions, including repeatedly and purposely violating the rules of your workplace until you are disciplined or fired, sabotaging your romantic relationships, or engaging in self-harm, excessive self-isolation, compulsive lying, and high-risk stuff like substance abuse. If you seem to be sabotaging or punishing yourself, consider that it may be time to try and stop, and that a professional may be able to help.\n\n\n\n6. Manic Periods\n\nThe mania associated with bipolar disorders isn't exactly a \"high,\" even though it may feel like it when you are experiencing it. If you occasionally experience periods of phenomenally high energy when you hardly sleep, feel vaguely invincible, are convinced of your own luck and genius, are hugely productive and erratic, and get easily distracted, then you may have a variety of bipolar disorder. This is particularly worrisome if you often commit actions that then need to be \"fixed\" when you feel more level, such as over-spending or making impulsive decisions. Talk to a doctor about your experiences and learn about what steps you can take to make sure that your moods remain more manageable.\n\n7. Serious Anhedonia\n\nAnhedonia is the technical term for losing complete interest in anything, including things that used to interest or absorb you, and it's a classic sign of developing depression. If you've suddenly stopped doing one or multiple activities that you really cared about, and you don't know why, this is a matter of concern. If you stopped doing them because you hate the other people involved, have changed interests, or decided that archery just isn't for you, that's no big deal; the issue is when you drop things that give you joy, for reasons that have nothing to do with scheduling or other logistics. Abandonment of hobbies, social activities and other sources of fun and support are a serious matter and not just you going through a \"bit of a slump;\" yes, it is legit to go to a doctor because you just don't feel interested in anything any more.\n\n8. Self-Punishing Thoughts\n\n\"I'm an idiot\", \"why on earth did I do that\", \"I don't deserve XYZ\": if these sort of thoughts starts cropping up in your head, and actively interfere with or drown out more positive thinking processes , you may need professional assistance. Negative thought patterns can be extremely controlling and difficult to break, though cognitive behavioral therapy can help . These kinds of thought patterns are associated with mood and anxiety disorders, and you shouldn't feel like you have to \"just try to find a way to live with them\" \u2014 nobody deserves to be repeatedly beating themselves up over everything.\n\n9. Compulsions And/Or Fear-Based Behavior\n\nWhen I say \"fear-based behavior,\" I'm actually spreading the net pretty wide. Do you avoid social spaces, particular scenarios, or people or animals due to crippling terror? Do you actively shape your life around avoiding triggering anxiety? Do you have rituals or practices that you have to do to feel safe, even if they don't seem to make much rational sense? Any one of these may indicate that an anxiety issue has gotten slightly out of control and could benefit from professional attention. A life controlled and directed by anxiety and the avoidance of potential terror is not the life you have to have, and it's definitely important enough to see somebody about \u2014 and getting a handle on it is probably easier than you think.\n\n\n\nIn fact, none of these problems are hopeless, no matter how bleak you might feel right now about treatment working for you. You have nothing to lose and everything to gain from reaching out and talking to someone.\n\nImages: Pixabay, Giphy", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/159601-9-mental-health-symptoms-you-should-never-ignore", "summary": "What kinds of mental health symptoms should prompt you to call your GP and immediately schedule a mental health evaluation?\nWhatever you're imagining, it's probably more extreme than many of the actual signs that indicate that you're dealing with serious mental health issues that need professional care.\nIf you're experiencing mental health distress but are not able to get to a doctor, contact a mental health hotline, like the National Alliance on Mental illness is at 800-950-6264, Mental Health American is at 800-969-6642, or the Panic Disorder Information Hotline is at 800-64-PANIC.\nAnd if you have experienced any suicidal or self-harming thoughts, seek help from a helpline, a friend or family member you trust, or a mental health professional immediately.\nIf any of these nine mental health symptoms below are occurring in your life, please get in contact with a doctor or mental health professional who can help \u2014 and remember that treatment, help, and hope are available.", "timescraped": 1513838412.644704, "category": {"words": 1600, "personal": 6, "thirdperson": 13, "condition": 19, "recovery": 0}}, "282e2ee6607113e25db3d8ea6894b1be": {"title": "'The Hills' Alum Lo Bosworth Opens Up About Her Mental Health Struggles In An Inspiring Way", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/2017/3/12/542898678.jpg?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "text": "For many of us, we spent our tween or teenage years obsessing over shows like The Hills and Laguna Beach. Yet while we loved these shows, it was easy to forget that their stars were actually real humans with thoughts and emotions that weren't always reflected on-screen \u2014 which is one of the reasons why The Hills' alum Lo Bosworth's openness about her struggles with mental health is so moving. On March 10, the now-professional chef took to her blog, The Lo Down, to share a written piece and video about her year struggling with depression and anxiety, a battle that kept her from creating the content she has become well-known for, and her words are incredibly inspiring.\n\nBosworth starts her post with the note that while she felt like 2016 was \"the worst year ever\", she still had some positive experiences, such as starting a feminine wellness company, getting a puppy, and turning 30. However, there was still some darkness happening during the year, in the form of an un-diagnosed vitamin deficiency that left Bosworth to deal with \"crippling anxiety and depression.\"\n\nShe goes on to describe, in detail, how she felt during this time, \"I mean, can you imagine having a 60 day long panic attack? I can now \u2013 I lived it. On top of all of this, imagine that you have no idea why your body is turning itself inside out, your brain feels like it\u2019s on Pluto, and your sweet boyfriend is wondering what the f*ck is going on,\" Bosworth writes. These are important words for anyone who has faced issues with their own mental health. While everyone's experiences are unique, there's no question that any person struggling, especially public figures like Bosworth, who chooses to speak out about their issues is doing some much-needed work in helping destigmatize mental illness and provide support for those suffering.\n\nlobosworth on YouTube\n\nBosworth explains in the post that at the tail end of 2015, she began to feel \"off,\" so at the beginning of 2016 she began therapy and medication, the latter of which she describes as a \"vicious\" cycle of, \"up and down. Up and down.\" And yet through all these things that helped her \u2014 therapy, medication, support of friends and family, exercise \u2014 something still felt unanswered. Then, in September, when doctors were surprised by the celeb's lack of progress, they ordered a complex blood test that revealed Bosworth had severe deficiencies of Vitamins B12 and Vitamin D. Symptoms of this include depression, anxiety, fatigue, headaches, dizziness, and more.\n\nThe TV personality discovered that she has mutations in the MTHFR and MAOA genes, which break down Vitamins B12 and D. In order to heal, she started taking the \"most bio-available methylated form\" of both vitamins, and \"following a strict regime everyday.\" Bosworth now says she feels \"better even than I did in 2014 and most of 2015 leading up to The Great Depression,\" which is so great to hear.\n\nMike Coppola/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nBosworth's dedication to working through her mental health issues to fully understand and combat them is so important. While there isn't a \"silver bullet\" to fix things, it's great to hear that, as she writes in the post, she believes that, \"you should fight, you should explore, you should take your health into your own hands and be your own advocate, and that you CAN come out the other side with some serious scars, but feeling like a brand new human being.\"\n\nSpeaking out about her struggle, a time in which Bosworth apparently \"could barely process\" her feelings, \"let alone work a full 9-5 on YouTube videos,\" is such a huge deal. The mental health stigma is real, which may cause those impacted (one in five adults per year, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness) to not get the help they need.

I often discuss the effects my anorexia and bulimia had on my body, my mind, and my relationship; I also attend functions, participate in NEDA events, and write about the reality of eating disorders online.\n\nBut this ready openness did not come easily. For years, I could not even internally acknowledge my eating disorders, let alone talk about them in public. I realize now that this is common with all types of mental illnesses, due in large part to the stigma surrounding mental healthcare. A recent poll from Kings College found that stigma \u2014 a mark of disgrace associated with a particular quality \u2014 prevents 25 percent of people age 18-25 from seeking help for mental illness. For a long time, I fell squarely within that group.\n\nThough I had struggled with my weight and self-esteem throughout my life, my disordered eating began in high school. As my schooling progressed, so did my eating disorders; during my sophomore year of college, I broke past my lowest previous weight and kept dropping. By this point, I was able to admit that I had an unhealthy relationship with food and myself, but I was unsure of how to proceed. While my eating disorders were suffocating, I always feared that living with the stigma of mental illness attached to me would be worse. So, I got sicker and sicker. Then, in June 2013, I was sexually assaulted and shut down altogether.\n\nI spent most of my time at the hospital asleep or sedated. When I was awake, I would watch the heart monitor spike and dip along with my heart beat. Looking at that jagged line moving across the screen, I realized I was finally more afraid of dying than I was of being 'outed' for my eating disorders.\n\nI took a medical leave from college that fall semester. I wasn\u2019t processing my trauma, and my eating disorders were constantly undermining my ability to function. I started experiencing dissociative seizures that were exacerbated by my body physically shutting down from malnourishment. A month later, I was admitted to the hospital. I cried and battled with the doctors, insisting \u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m not insane, it\u2019s not in my head. I\u2019m not crazy.\u201d\n\nThat hospital visit was an epiphany \u2014 though not necessarily the good kind. Nurses could not find my veins to take blood samples, I didn't have enough body fat to safely receive necessary procedures, and my resting heart rate was 42 beats per minute. I spent most of my time at the hospital asleep or sedated. When I was awake, I would watch the heart monitor spike and dip along with my heart beat. Looking at that jagged line moving across the screen, I realized I was finally more afraid of dying than I was of being 'outed' for my eating disorders. At that moment, I knew I had to face the stigma if I wanted a chance to feel whole again.\n\nLuke Castille\n\nI entered a treatment clinic a few months later. After some group sessions, I realized that feeling embarrassed and inadequate because of the disorders we lived with, be it binge eating, bulimia, anorexia, or UFED, was a common theme in the lives of many others in treatment.\n\nTwo years of weekly individual and group therapy helped me change my perception of mental illness, which in turn helped me value myself and others \u2014 and that went a long way in aiding my recovery and eventual remission. As it's currently National Eating Disorder Awareness Week, it is my hope that we can begin to dismantle the stigma that folks with eating disorders (or other mental illnesses) must live with \u2014 stigma that can often take the form of the six myths below.\n\nMyth: Stigma Is Not A Barrier to Treatment\n\nThe National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) describes mental health stigma as \"one of the most challenging aspects of living with a mental health condition.\" Stigma typically entails prejudicial attitudes and discriminating behavior directed towards individuals with or perceived to have mental illness, and can leave the recipient feeling shame or humiliation. As you might expect, this makes it more difficult to seek treatment.\n\nWith eating disorders in particular, stigma propagates the notion that they are self-inflicted, choices or diets gone awry. When ideas like that get absorbed into the social consciousness, it can be difficult for some to see how life-threatening eating disorders are.\n\nMental health stigma is dangerous \u2014 but it is also nothing new. Heather Stuart in World Psychiatry notes, \"negative societal responses to the mentally ill have been ubiquitous throughout history \u2014 a situation that has persisted through changing concepts of mental illness \u2014 even through the rise of medical theories and biologically-based explanations for most mental disorders.\"\n\nWhenever an attitude is this commonplace, it can be difficult to realize the role you may play in continuing its existence \u2014 which is why it's so important to take an active role in calling out stigma and working to dismantle it.\n\nMy therapist used to tell me, \"A lapse does not mean relapse.\" If you are working towards recovery, know that a bad day does not make you weak or less worthy.\n\nMyth: Telling Yourself \"You Are Beautiful\" Can Cure All Eating Disorders\n\nIn a time of increased awareness and knowledge of body positivity and acceptance, I don\u2019t want to undermine or undersell the importance of those movements. However, some approaches to treatment that stress body positivity can miss the fact that eating disorders are multifaceted mental illnesses.\n\nEating disorders aren't just about body image or wanting to lose weight. Social expectations can be a component (i.e. stigma, unrealistic body expectations, etc.), but so can biological factors and psychological influences. For example, eating disorders can be rooted in issues with biochemistry \u2014 certain chemicals in the brain that control hunger and appetite can become unbalanced and fuel feeding or eating disorders. Lack of control, low-self esteem, and negative self-evaluation can also drive disordered habits.\n\nMy own eating disorders were often agitated by a perceived lack of control and rush of negative emotions. If I had a fight with my partner, I would often purge to release negative emotions. If my school schedule started to get hectic, I would carefully draw out calorie maps to monitor and reduce my caloric intake. In those moments, I didn\u2019t care what I looked like \u2014 I cared about what I felt.\n\nBody positivity can be a great help to some people suffering from eating disorders, and less of an asset to others. It is vital to remember eating disorders are genuinely complex mental health issues, and like all mental health issues, need to be addressed differently among different people. By doing so, we can start building community support systems and having productive, open conversations.\n\nMyth: Only Certain Kinds Of People Have Eating Disorders\n\nMy group session was one of several that the clinic hosted. Towards the end of my first year, I learned that one of the groups was for male patients. I asked my therapist why the men were not allowed in my session, which included a diverse group of women.\n\nHe told me the clinic didn't separate us to draw a distinction; rather, the men were all relatively new patients who were still uncomfortable talking about their thoughts and behaviors in front of women. The persistent stigma that only women suffer from eating disorders made it difficult for these men to access the full range of care available to them at the clinic.\n\nAs a white, cisgender female, I had not spent much time thinking about the intersectionality of eating disorders. To be perfectly honest, I did not think about it all. At that point, I didn't think I knew anyone else with an eating disorder, so my only metric was myself. But after that discussion, I logged onto the National Eating Disorder Association's website and started to read the stories shared and published on their blog. It helped me learn more about the people often missing from the primary cultural narrative about eating disorders and mental health in general.\n\nEating disorders affect people of all races, gender identities, sexualities, and ethnicities. It is important that we realize this and push for universal access to affordable, mental healthcare. Everyone\u2019s experience is valid and worthy of recovery.\n\nMyth: Once You Go Through Recovery, You're \"Cured\"\n\nI started my program with a mindset that it would be a transformative experience that would halt my habits completely. However, that wasn\u2019t the case; even now, two years into remission, I still have bad days when I feel the compulsion to restrict my diet or purge.\n\nBut I don\u2019t beat myself up for it. Part of recovery is learning to love and accept yourself, faults and all. And while that is difficult, there are steps to get there. NEDA recommends starting small: cut yourself some slack and pay attention to how you are feeling. It may seem a little bit basic, but NEDA stresses \"for those recovering from an eating disorder, taking time for self-care is an especially important part of recovery.\" Small, continuous steps forward add up.\n\nAnd while there may be bumps in the road, they should not derail your progress. My therapist used to tell me, \"A lapse does not mean relapse.\" If you are working towards recovery, know that a bad day does not make you weak or less worthy.\n\nMyth: Therapy Is The Only Thing Necessary To Treat An Eating Disorder\n\nAt first, I was resistant to taking medication for my eating disorder, because I was barely coping with the idea of therapy \u2014 the thought of taking medication made me feel even more out of control and weak. But as I discussed this with my psychiatrist, he pointed out that I was once again letting stigma control my recovery. And he was right. Once we broke down my emotions on a chemical level, I began to realize that in some cases, medicine is necessary \u2014 and this was one of those cases.\n\nI can\u2019t say this loudly enough: Taking medication does not make you a failure. I was prescribed an assortment of medication throughout my therapy sessions to cope with depression, PTSD, and anxiety. This overlap is not unusual \u2014 almost 70 percent of people diagnosed with eating disorders also have what are called Axis 1 comorbidity disorders, which include anxiety, depression, and social phobias.\n\nCrystal Karages, MS, RDN, IBCLC with Eating Disorder Hope wrote that \"The right medication can be a therapeutic part of treatment and managing symptoms associated with anxiety or depression. When these symptoms are better managed, this can help a person focus on recovering from the eating disorder more effectively.\" Seeking treatment and help, be it through medicine, therapy, or a combination of the two, should be lauded.\n\nMyth: It Doesn't Matter What Motivates You To Go Into Treatment \u2014 Your Outcome Will Be The Same\n\nOnce I was stabilized at the hospital, my grandparents and I discussed treatment programs. I hesitated, but after seeing how tired and worn out my family was from late nights in waiting rooms, I resigned myself to entering one. While that got me to go to the program, it wasn\u2019t until I decided that I wanted to be there for myself that I found my habits and thoughts changing. After that, I was able to not only participate in recovery steps, but actively maintain the work I was doing.\n\nPart of addressing the low self-esteem or self-image that can accompany an eating disorder is learning to find value in oneself. By improving your self-evaluation, you can increase motivation for recovery. This in turn can significantly reduce your chance of relapse. But even with motivation, support, and therapy, recovery is difficult and not every recovery is going to look the same. And that's okay, as long as you remember to prioritize your self and your health.\n\nThese tips are by no means exhaustive. Much like any mental illness, the stigmas surrounding eating disorders are fed by several factors. But working to dismantle those stigmas can help create an environment where more people can find relief and treatment. I urge you to look at organizations like NEDA and NAMI to keep up with events happening in your community and online. Active and continued participation can help the thousands of people living with an eating disorder find peace and acceptance.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with an eating disorder, please consider having a conversation and getting screened at NEDA's website or a local care facility.", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/p/entering-eating-disorder-treatment-showed-me-the-truth-about-these-6-recovery-myths-41513", "summary": "For example, eating disorders can be rooted in issues with biochemistry \u2014 certain chemicals in the brain that control hunger and appetite can become unbalanced and fuel feeding or eating disorders.\nAt that point, I didn't think I knew anyone else with an eating disorder, so my only metric was myself.\nPart of addressing the low self-esteem or self-image that can accompany an eating disorder is learning to find value in oneself.\nBut even with motivation, support, and therapy, recovery is difficult and not every recovery is going to look the same.\nActive and continued participation can help the thousands of people living with an eating disorder find peace and acceptance.", "timescraped": 1513838415.393562, "category": {"words": 2090, "personal": 81, "thirdperson": 8, "condition": 19, "recovery": 5}}, "f0e5a5af2be0c210b101b1752d7588c1": {"title": "What Does A Semicolon Tattoo Mean?

This doesn't mean that finding motivation on social media is inherently bad; it is, however, another reminder that social media's effect on us largely has to do with how we use it.\n   \nIn fact, according to the Huffington Post, researchers even hypothesized that fitspiration posts may be especially dangerous because the subjects are typically regular women, rather than models.\n\nThe problem boils down to our tendency to compare ourselves to others. We've all heard that social media might make you depressed, but further research has indicated that this effect depends on how you use it. According to a study earlier this year, users who are prone to social comparison are more likely to become depressed after using Facebook. However, a different study found that users who tend to go on Facebook merely to stay in touch with friends don't experience this effect.\n\nFurther research has yet to be done, but it's easy to see how the same phenomenon could apply to fitspiration. Researchers also asked participants if they felt more inspired to work out and improve their diets after viewing fitspiration posts, and many women reported that the photos had the intended effect.\n\nAs with most things, the key appears to be moderation. If #fitspo posts motivate you to work out, then by all means, stay motivated however you can. Goodness knows it's hard enough to make myself go running at the end of the day.\n\nOn the other hand, it's important not to get too wrapped up in other people's fitness regimens. So what if your gym selfie doesn't get as many \"likes\" as your college friend's? So what if you try your favorite fitness blogger's avocado-kale-cayenne pepper smoothie and hate it? The important thing is that you're staying healthy and feeling good. Besides, if it helps, this is what I usually look like when I try to work out:\n\nNo matter what happens, at least you haven't faceplanted on a treadmill during a gym's peak hour \u2014 and even if you have?

Although they are quite different illnesses, there are some subtle differences between bipolar disorder and depression that some might easily miss. However, knowing what differentiates the two can help people get the right treatment they need.\n\nSince bipolar disorder does contain depressive periods, it's not uncommon for people to miss the signs and treat it as depression instead. In fact, nearly seven out of 10 people with bipolar disorder are misdiagnosed at least once, according to research published in the journal Psychiatry.\n\n\"It\u2019s common for people to confuse bipolar disorder and depression in someone because bipolar disorder is the combination of depression and mania or hypomania, which can present separately or together,\" says Laurel Steinberg, PhD, a therapist and professor of psychology at Columbia University, over email. \"If someone sees a person in a purely depressed phase of bipolar disorder, there would be no evidence that the person experiences mania other times.\"\n\nBecause they require different treatments, it's important to be able to spot the differences between the two disorders. Here are four subtle differences between bipolar disorder and depression that some people tend to miss.\n\n1 How It Feels To \"Feel Better\" Depression and bipolar disorder tend to be confused because the \"highs\" of bipolar disorder are often confused for a patient feeling better. \"Sometimes milder episodes of mania \u2014 called hypomania \u2014 can resemble seasons of health, as individuals are often highly productive and cheerful during these seasons,\" says psychologist Marie Fang, PsyD over email. \"It's possible for loved ones to interpret a hypomanic episode as a sign of health rather than a symptom of bipolar disorder. Further, it's common to miss these episodes of elevated mood if they're relatively infrequent and short-lived compared to the depressive episodes.\"\n\n2 The Typical Length Of A \"Low\" Depressive \"lows\" are a component of both depression and bipolar disorder. However, in depression, the lows are constant, while individuals with bipolar disorder cycle between periods of low moods and high moods \u2014 or intense irritability along with high energy \u2014 even if the highs are short-lived. A depressed mood in bipolar disorder will typically last three months to two years at a time, and sometimes longer, says Fang.\n\n3 How You Experience A Range Of Emotions \"Manic episodes can be mild, where you have sudden pockets of energy all the way to severe, where you feel grandiose and don't sleep for days on end,\" says psychologist Wyatt Fisher, Psy.D. over email. \"Depressive episodes can be mild where you feel down and lack motivation all the way to severe where you can't get out of bed and feel like harming yourself. Those with bipolar experience cycles between manic and depressive pockets whereas those with depression only have depressive symptoms.\"", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/p/4-subtle-differences-between-bipolar-disorder-depression-that-are-easy-to-miss-5518304", "summary": "Although they are quite different illnesses, there are some subtle differences between bipolar disorder and depression that some might easily miss.\nSince bipolar disorder does contain depressive periods, it's not uncommon for people to miss the signs and treat it as depression instead.\nIn fact, nearly seven out of 10 people with bipolar disorder are misdiagnosed at least once, according to research published in the journal Psychiatry.\nHere are four subtle differences between bipolar disorder and depression that some people tend to miss.\n1 How It Feels To \"Feel Better\" Depression and bipolar disorder tend to be confused because the \"highs\" of bipolar disorder are often confused for a patient feeling better.", "timescraped": 1513838397.0809338, "category": {"words": 491, "personal": 0, "thirdperson": 4, "condition": 11, "recovery": 0}}, "aff802c7ebdd3862621fd4261f1af982": {"title": "8 of the Most Realistic Portrayals of Mental Illness in Contemporary YA", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost/2016/9/13/45598184-4a2c-4cd1-8dcf-40452ac2176e.png?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "text": "As is often discussed in the #WeNeedDiverseBooks campaign, sometimes the biggest way to stigmatize people is to not talk about them at all. People, particularly teenagers, who cope with mental health issues are often stigmatized because of this lack of realistic portrayals in pop culture. Mental Health Awareness Month is celebrated in May to reduce this stigma and promote awareness of various mental health issues.\n\nAccording to the National Alliance on Mental Illness in 2013, approximately 20 percent of people aged 13 to 18 experience severe mental disorders in a given year, and half of all chronic mental illness begins by the age 14. Suicide is the third leading cause of death among people aged 15 to 25, and mood disorders, including depression, are the third most common cause of hospitalization in the United States for young adults. However, these stats may also be skewed low, because of the stigma around mental illness, some teenagers are reluctant to seek help. A National Institute of Health report said that this stigma can cause long delays from when a person experiences symptoms and reports those symptoms, despite available treatment options.\n\nBooks with characters that have mental health issues have the ability to help readers on an individual basis. It can help readers square themselves with the idea that they are not alone. Young adult novels, in particular, have a unique opportunity to create realistic representations of people with mental illnesses. One of the main themes of YA literature is characters that must situate themselves in the world as they search for a sense of identity. Mental illness has a way to dislodge a person's sense of self, forcing people to wrestle with their own sense of identity. It's an opportunity for YA novels to also wrestle with this issue with realistic characters.\n\nThese 8 young adult novels give realistic portrayals of people coping with a mental illness, and they help raise awareness in the hopes to reduce the stigma.\n\n1. It's Kind of a Funny Story by Ned Vizzini\n\nAuthor Ned Vizzini's personal struggle with depression inspired his beloved novel It's Kind of a Funny Story. Vizzini tackles depression in his young protagonist with humor, portraying his time hospitalized for his mental illness. Tragically, Vizzini committed suicide in the fall, but his legacy will continue to live on via his novel, one of the most realistic portrayals of depression ever written.\n\nI work. And I think about work, and I freak out about work, and I think about how much I think about work, and I freak out about how much I think about how much I think about work, and I think about how freaked out I get about how much I think about how much I think about work.\n\n2. Something Like Normal by Trish Doller\n\nTravis Stephenson is a U.S. Marine who has spent seven months overseas in Afghanistan. He has a month-long leave, where he is allowed to go home to relax \u2014 but is it really that easy? Without politicizing the war, Trish Doller looks into the hardship soldiers (and their love ones) experience not just at war, but returning home with PTSD feeling out of place in the world.\n\nBut what has been done can't be undone. My best friend is dead and I'm never going to be the same Travis Stephenson.\n\n3. Crazy by Amy Reed\n\nAmy Reed takes a painfully honest look at the high highs and low lows of bipolar disorder in Crazy. Izzy and Connor meet as summer camp counselors, and the novel is told in alternating chapters from each of their voices as Izzy starts to descend into mental illness. Upon Crazy's release, the reaction was overwhelmingly positive, with my readers saying just how close to home Izzy's story hit. Reed doesn't romanticize mental illness, but she doesn't make it \"other\" either.\n\nEven though I'm sleeping again, everything still feels a little rickety, like I'm here but not quite here, like I'm just a stand-in for my real self, like someone could just reach over and pinch me and I'd deflate. I thought I was feeling better, but I don't know anymore.\n\n4. Freaks Like Us by Susan Vaught\n\nSusan Vaught's Freaks Like Us is a first-person account of two friends and their search for another missing friend. But the narrator has schizophrenia. Aside from being an author, Vaught is a psychologist and she has written a searingly honest, albeit funny, story about three friends, Jason the narrator, Drip who has ADHD, and Sunshine, who is selectively mute.\n\nI'm told I don't think like other people, and I'm pretty sure that's true.\n\n5. Hold Still by Nina LaCour\n\nIn both words and illustrations, Nina LaCour's Hold Still centers on Caitlin, as she reads notes in her friend Ingrid's journal. Ingrid recently committed suicide. The letters follow Ingrid's slow descent into depression, giving insight to readers who are suffering or who know someone who is.\n\nThe sun stopped shining for me is all. The whole story is: I am sad. I am sad all the time and the sadness is so heavy that I can't get away from it. Not ever.\n\n6. The Impossible Knife of Memory by Laurie Halse Anderson\n\nLaurie Halse Anderson, author of Speak , is never one to shy away from tough subjects. In The Impossible Knife of Memory , a teenage girl must cope with her soldier father's post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). On the surface, the father and daughter seem \"normal,\" but they are fighting with issues underneath. The YA novel shows how mental illness can ricochet around a family, affecting everyone.\n\nI swallowed the fear. It\u2019s always there \u2014 fear \u2014and if you don\u2019t stay on top of it, you\u2019ll drown. I swallowed again and stood tall, shoulders broad, arms loose. I was balanced, ready to move. My body said, 'Yeah, you\u2019re bigger and stronger, but if you touch this, I will hurt you.'\n\n7. Will Grayson, Will Grayson by John Green and David Levithan\n\nJohn Green and David Levithan don't define will grayson (who only writes in lowercase) by just his depression. The authors are able to take a character with a mental illness and show how he may realistically cope with it day by day. They show will grayson as a stronger person because of how he thinks about and works through his own depression. Will Grayson, Will Grayson also offers a critique of how society's offhand use of \"depressed\" or \"mental health\" are not helpful for people who are diagnosed with mental illness.\n\n\u201ci think the idea of a 'mental health day' is something completely invented by people who have no clue what it's like to have bad mental health. the idea that your mind can be aired out in twenty-four hours is kind of like saying heart disease can be cured if you eat the right breakfast cereal. mental health days only exist for people who have the luxury of saying 'i don't want to deal with things today' and then can take the whole day off, while the rest of us are stuck fighting the fights we always fight, with no one really caring one way or another, unless we choose to bring a gun to school or ruin the morning announcements with a suicide.\u201d\n\n8. The Nature of Jade by Deb Caletti\n\nJade DeLuna is prone to panic attacks. Despite her logical reasoning, Jade becomes consumed with anxiety about her fatality and is unable to talk herself out of her panics. To calm herself, Jade watches live feeds of animals at the zoo. Deb Caletti's story The Nature of Jade creates a well-rounded, relatable protagonist, who doesn't want to be defined by her mental illness, and offers a realistic view of what panic attacks are like for those who suffer from them.\n\nOr so we don't think about how we're just vulnerable specks trying to survive on a violent, tumultuous planet, at the mercy of hurricanes and volcanoes and asteroids and terrorists and disease and a million other things. We concentrate on having little thoughts so we don't have BIG THOUGHTS. . . . You've got to ignore the one big truth \u2014 life is fatal.\n\nImage: Giphy", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/23614-8-of-the-most-realistic-portrayals-of-mental-illness-in-contemporary-ya", "summary": "Mental Health Awareness Month is celebrated in May to reduce this stigma and promote awareness of various mental health issues.\nAccording to the National Alliance on Mental Illness in 2013, approximately 20 percent of people aged 13 to 18 experience severe mental disorders in a given year, and half of all chronic mental illness begins by the age 14.\nHowever, these stats may also be skewed low, because of the stigma around mental illness, some teenagers are reluctant to seek help.\nMental illness has a way to dislodge a person's sense of self, forcing people to wrestle with their own sense of identity.\nThe YA novel shows how mental illness can ricochet around a family, affecting everyone.", "timescraped": 1513838398.711067, "category": {"words": 1382, "personal": 39, "thirdperson": 31, "condition": 25, "recovery": 0}}, "7536ecaebadfe07d58b5eb80ac10a431": {"title": "On Mental Health Day, It's Time To Talk About How Homeless Women Aren't Getting The Care They Really Need", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/uploads/image/2017/10/10/fb428e59-9670-4bd7-9be3-ea0178e02534-pexels-photo-236147.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "text": "In honor of World Mental Health Day, we\u2019re shedding a light on the true story of homeless women across America. From the untold circumstances that brought it on, to the lack of trauma care given to them, the odds are stacked against these women. The topic: A look at the struggles homeless women with mental illness face \u2014 and how we can help them.\n\nOn a September night at The Dwelling Place of NY, the dining hall came alive with residents' excitement. In the transitional residence, founded 40 years ago to provide a space for homeless women to get the help and support they need, an actor visited to teach the ladies some of his best clown moves. As the women tried their hand at it, the staff joined in and, soon, the whole shelter was filled with laughter. As the night winded down, one of the residents made her way over to Sister Joann Sambs, the shelter's administrator. She said that for those 45 minutes, spent quite literally clowning around, her problems had slipped away. In those three quarters of an hour, she was not a homeless woman recovering in a shelter, but just another woman, enjoying her life.\n\nWhen Sister Joann relayed this story to me the following day, I was immediately heartened by the strength that these women, who have been through horrible ordeals, can still have to create a better life for themselves. Many of the women at the shelter not only deal with the economic issues of being homeless, but also the trauma that has come from the painful experiences they've faced.\n\nHomeless women's struggles with mental health issues will be out of the spotlight, even though they're more likely to struggle with depression.\n\nOn October 10, over 100 countries, including the U.S., recognize World Mental Health Day, a day designated to increase mental health education and awareness globally. However, homeless women's struggles with mental health issues will be out of the spotlight, even though research shows they're more likely to struggle with depression. Homeless women are often treated as though they created their situation, with too many people questioning why they should be helped. In truth, most women have fled a horrific situation, with no other option than to become homeless. Nearly 50 percent of all women who are homeless report that domestic violence was the immediate cause of their homelessness. So this World Mental Health Day, it's time to put a stop to their invisibility and acknowledge the care these women need.\n\nHow Many Homeless Women Face Mental Health Issues?\n\nAs of 2015, the National Alliance to End Homelessness reported that about 565,000 people living in the United States were homeless on any given night. Of that number, an estimated almost 40 percent of those individuals are women. According to the American Psychological Association, 47 percent of those women are living with a major depressive disorder, which is double the amount of women in the general population who have a major depressive disorder.\n\nEven when facing a mental health issue not as severe as a major depressive disorder, homeless women often lack the resources to get help, which only exasperates their problem. Additionally, 85 percent of homeless families are headed by women, creating an extra burden for women who are mothers. \"[The mental illness] may not be the most severe form but it certainly can be debilitating and it certainly can impact how well they can provide for their children and their functioning,\" Dr. Carmela DeCandia, licensed psychologist and professor in Boston College's mental health counseling program, tells Bustle. \"And people don't necessarily want to look at that because they want to look at homelessness as basically just an issue of housing but it\u2019s not just about housing, and the moms with trauma and depression really aren't getting the services that they need.\" To get help, women first have to find a shelter to take them in \u2014 something that has become increasingly difficult.\n\nMental Health Shelters Are Unable To Meet Demand\n\nAs time passes, things have only been getting worse for homeless women with mental illness. The Coalition For The Homeless (CFTH) reports that the amount of homeless New Yorkers currently sleeping in shelters is 77 percent higher than it was 10 years ago. The organization also reported that the amount of shelter beds provided for those requiring mental health support decreased from 26 percent to 24.3 percent between 2014 and 2016. While shelter capacity grew 17 percent, mental health capacity increased by only 12 percent.\n\nRecognizing this lack of access, CFTH teamed with The Legal Aid Society to submit testimony to The New York City Council Committee on Mental Health, Developmental Disability, Alcoholism, Substance Abuse and Disability Services. The testimony explained that, while the need for additional mental health beds is increasing, the supply has not risen along with it. As a result, there's not enough room in shelters for homeless individuals affected by illness.\n\nIn another recent heartbreaking report, the City\u2019s Department of Homeless Services found that out of the first 120 days of 2017, there were 35 days without a single mental health bed vacancy for homeless men and 18 days without a mental health bed available for homeless women.\n\nDealing with a mental illness while homeless is a challenge in and of itself but, the lack of shelter placements available has further exasperated these issues. \"I mean, there's mental illness and then there's a form of stress and depression that sort of manifests itself,\" Ruth White, MSSA, Executive Director, National Council on Homelessness and Child Welfare, tells Bustle. \"So, it's like, along the mental illness continuum, things get more and more exacerbated.\"\n\nThe testimony went on to explain that in place of a bed, people have had no other option but to sleep in a chair or face extremely unstable placements, like moving locations night after night or waiting for a mental health bed to become available.\n\nWhere Did Affordable Housing Go?\n\nEven for the homeless women that do get into shelters, it's unlikely they'll know where they'll go from there. \"When I started my social work career in the 90s, you didn't just have an emergency response, you could actually get someone into affordable housing,\" White says. \"Housing was not so out of scale with income, so, at that point in history, women's mental illness would not become exacerbated and completely out of control, because of the stress. We could help them move into a shelter, then we could very quickly move them through the shelter system into affordable housing.\"\n\nWhite believes that affordable housing is no longer a reality, meaning the option of a federal housing subsidy is ruled out as well. \"If you're a social worker working with a family, that's not an option. But also, the affordable housing crisis is absolutely out of control,\" says White. \"Even for working people who are doing pretty well, housing is becoming something like 50 to 70 percent of their income.\" A 2016 Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies report indicated that over 11 million Americans are spending over half of their income on rent with another 21 million spending at least 30 percent.\n\nAs it's become harder to find a sustainable housing solution, women are remaining in shelters. Some women are even forgoing a shelter and staying in abusive relationships because they don't see a way out. Each factor leads to these women's mental health being compromised as the stress and inability to control their fate weighs down on them.\n\n\"Just because it might not be as dramatic as something that you might see, doesn't mean it's not there.\"\n\nWhile the shortage of beds is certainly to blame, the lack of urgency to find solutions for homeless women dealing with mental health issues also contributes to the problem. \"I think, even in our society, people don't recognize that women struggling with domestic violence or interpersonal trauma and, even a mild level of depression, affects [their] functioning,\" Dr. DeCandia says. \"You might not be walking around the street, but you may keep having trouble holding a job, you might be having trouble meeting all your kids needs, you may have trouble sleeping at night, or be in a relationship and kind of having trouble functioning over time. Even finishing school perhaps. So, just because it might not be as dramatic as something that you might see, doesn't mean it's not there. And I think we have to really get serious about acknowledging that.\" Luckily there are places that do acknowledge that all forms of mental illness must be taken seriously, and open their doors to help.\n\nWhere Homeless Women Can Get Help\n\nTheDwellingPlaceOfNYC/Facebook\n\nLuckily, there are shelters dedicated to providing their residents with the mental health care they need. The Dwelling Place brings in a psych practitioner to meet with any women suffering who are not already in a mental health program.\n\nSister Nancy Chiarello, one of the founders and a case worker, initially noticed the variety of living options for homeless men, but that the same ones didn't exist for women. Today, the space holds up to 14 women who each stay, on average, for six months to a year. The organization is prides itself on providing a space where women can rediscover their inner strength and create the life they want. An emphasis is placed on the importance of learning how to cope with mental illness in order to achieve this life.\n\nAs for the way these women manage their mental health, it's not much different from anyone else. \"Getting counseling, getting therapy, getting support and getting on the right medication,\" Sister Joann tells Bustle about the women's treatment. Even within the shelter's walls, where proper mental health care is taught, the women still feel the stigma that's wrongly placed on them.\n\nErasing The Stigma Around Mental Illness\n\nWhile the discussion focused on medication as a treatment for mental illness has increased, the stigma against it still remains strong. It's still hard for people to know how to talk about it like we talk about other ailments.\n\n\"If someone has cancer everyone gathers around and supports them but, if someone is mentally ill, it's like, 'what's wrong with that person?'\"\n\n\"When we think of people with mental illness we want to run away from it,\" says Sister Joann. \"If someone has cancer everyone gathers around and supports them but, if someone is mentally ill, it's like, 'what's wrong with that person?' Or they have fear or shame. Many of the women come with the shame of being homeless and the shame of maybe being depressed or not being able to get your life together. It weighs heavy on them. So they need people to help them slowly work beyond that and look into themselves and find where their strengths are.\"\n\nAll of this mental illness stigma and disregard does is stand in the way of homeless women getting the help they need and leads them to feel ashamed even if they do take action to improve their mental health.\n\n\"If you take medication for diabetes, nobody stigmatizes that,\" says Sister Joann. \"But, if you have depression or other mental health issues, personality disorders, and things like that \u2014 or stress and tension \u2014 sometimes it [medicine] just helps. And it's OK to say, I need that, and to be under a doctor's care and get the support that you need. So you can live a quality life, which is so important.\"\n\nAfter The Dwelling Place, some of the women who require mental health care will transition into a supportive housing unit in the city. At a supportive housing unit, residents have private rooms but are provided meals and have help with tasks such as monitoring their medications.\n\n\"We all go through dark times in our life, but you can rise above it,\" says Sister Joann. \"You don't have to stay there. There are ways to rise above it and get help. For most of the women, it's a journey.\" When given support, their course can become quite a bit easier.\n\nWhat Can We Do To Help Homeless Women Affected By Mental Illness?\n \nIt's time to change the way we talk about and treat those with mental illness. \"I'm very worried about the future, about the next generation of marginalized families, because of what we're doing to the mothers in terms of stress and mental illness,\" says White. One way to help is by speaking out to ensure these women are given fair access to mental health care, so the next generation may not face the same issues as this one.\n\nWhen it comes to making donations, it's important to think outside the box about what women need.

That is why discussions ignited by people like Craig Stone, who recently shared the story of his journey with depression \u2014 and how ultimately, his life looks a whole lot different today than he might have imagined it would at darker points \u2014 are so meaningful to so many who relate, whether they feel comfortable talking about it or not. Bustle has reached out to him for comment, and will update this post upon reply.\n\nYou may have come across Craig Stone's books before; the author has garnered quite a following with his powerful words, and a recent post about his own personal struggles was no exception. It was roughly eight years ago, Stone wrote in a tweet on Sunday, that he sat on a bench and contemplated ending his life. Revisiting that same bench all these years later, he realized how far he has come \u2014 and that, in his own words, \"Hang in there. Love is always coming.\"\n\nHis tweet spoke to so many hearts, and at the time of this article, has gathered over 7,000 retweets and nearly 23,000 likes. It seems a lot of people can relate to the story, whether they themselves have had similar experiences, or know a loved one who has.\n\nSee that bench. 8yrs ago I sat on it thinking about throwing myself off Blackfriars Bridge. Today, I took this pic of my son. Tomorrow might be the same. But it might also be brighter. It might even bring unimaginable brilliance. Hang in there. Love is always coming. #depression \u2014 (@craigstone_) #\n\nSince posting the powerful image and accompanying message, his tweet has snowballed, and served as a powerful reminder to so many who are struggling with the same thoughts and feelings.\n\n@craigstone_ I have been going through a severe depression myself. Your tweet helps me see out today's day and probably tomorrow and then the day after. Thank you for sharing this and unknowingly inspiring me to fight another day. strength to you! \u2014 (@alok_ttid) #\n\n@craigstone_ Good on you mate. I was suicidal many time over the years but somehow kept going. I now have 4 kids. Meditation and medication I found very helpful. Learned to try and love myself. Every day a bonus. None of us know what lies ahead. Peace. xx \u2014 (@justinmufcdub) #\n\n@craigstone_ Thank YOU for this. I wouldn't have imagined that 280 characters are all that I needed to help me go through this. Yes, I will keep fighting. You will be glad to know that you have helped at least one person on this earth to climb out of this pit. \u2014 (@alok_ttid) #\n\n@craigstone_ Thank you Mr. Stone. The story about your powerful tweet, and the hope it has given many, has reached me at the moment I needed it most. \u2014 (@thenickpedota) #\n\n@craigstone_ I don't know you, never heard of you but your simple act of sharing your story has an incredible significance to many people who also don't know you. Thank you for your courage and being here to tell us all your story. Stay safe. \u2014 (@mentalenviro) #\n\n@craigstone_ Thank you for sharing your personal story in one profoundly inspirational tweet, Craig. You probably don't even realise just how many people you have given hope to. Thank you. #MentalHealthMatters \u2014 (@erikadallimore) #\n\n@craigstone_ I have been feeling that everything is pointless. You just reminded me things can be better in spite of that pointlessness and depression. Thank you. \u2014 (@emneesia) #\n\nWhile Stone is probably having a hard time keeping up with the outpouring of support, he still sees the love people are sending. He told Indy100, \"It\u2019s been a waterfall of human kindness. People are sharing their own experiences with depression. People with depression are talking to other people with depression. The conversation is healing. I\u2019ve received direct messages, several from people who just happened to read my tweet while thinking about acting out depressive thoughts. Which is mind blowing.\"\n\nAnd to think that Stone wasn't even going to say anything at all. \"I was going to walk past the bench and ignore it. It\u2019s a trick of the mind to stay silent; depression demands silence to do its best work, and I\u2019m just as susceptible to that trick as everyone else.\" But, in what hardly seems to be a coincidence, his wife decided to stop at a store right across from the bench, and his son began playing around it.\n\nFighting that urge to stay silent is, Stone says, the most important thing. \"If depression is the bullet people fire through their heads, silence is the gun ... The only way out of a pit is to announce you have fallen,\" he says, concluding with another powerful thought: \"If we hang around long enough, all the bad days fade to experience.\"\n\nReading through the comments here is a joy. And to think, they said Twitter was full of trolls. All I'm seeing is lovely people being supportive and happy for happiness. Thank you for all the lovely responses! Big hugs everyone. x \u2014 (@craigstone_) #\n\nStone's story is nothing short of amazing. He was once homeless and lived in a park, which was where he wrote his first book, The Squirrel Who Dreamt of Madness. It was around this time that he also met the woman who would become his wife and the mother of his child. This week, he didn't just reflect back on the person he was on the other side of it; so many who needed hope reflected right alongside him, too.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, every year, around one million people take their own lives. That comes out to about 3,000 per day, or one death every 40 seconds.

It's impossible to keep up with them on a reality show or through social media, so the only time we find out personal information about them is when they explicitly decide to share it themselves, and Prince Harry's latest message is one of his most important yet. In a new interview with the Telegraph, Prince Harry opened up about his struggles with his mental health, particularly when it came to grieving the death of his mother, Diana. And everything Harry is sharing is so important in reducing the stigma around getting help.\n\nAs Harry explained in the newspaper's Mad World podcast, the unexpected loss of his mother at such a young age was obviously incredibly difficult to deal with, so instead of coping, he ignored it. Not facing his grief led to \"total chaos\" in his life over 10 years later. So with the encouragement of his older brother, Prince William, he decided to seek counseling three years ago. And now, he's finally ready to open up about what that period of time in his life was like, as well as how he's doing today.\n\n'Two years of total chaos' Prince Harry describes struggle with emotional problems after Princess Diana's death https://t.co/X7nt6OXTo2 pic.twitter.com/6pqioXyrrl \u2014 AP Europe (@AP_Europe) April 17, 2017\n\nHarry said:\n\n\"I can safely say that losing my mum at the age of 12, and therefore shutting down all of my emotions for the last 20 years, has had a quite serious effect on not only my personal life but my work as well. I have probably been very close to a complete breakdown on numerous occasions when all sorts of grief and sort of lies and misconceptions and everything are coming to you from every angle.\u201d\n\nIt's hard to imagine what that must have been like for him \u2014 especially while living life in the spotlight. But as brave and as important as it is that he's coming forward with such honesty, what he learned in the process is important, too: The fact that he's not alone in this, because so many people suffer from issues like grief and depression.\n\nHe added:\n\n\"Keeping it quiet is only ever going to make it worse... You'll be surprised, firstly, at how much support you get, and secondly, how many people literally are longing for you to come out. You've got so much more in common than you thought with some people.\"\n\nAs someone who has struggled with depression, I can say that in my own experiences, Harry is 100 percent right. When I was finally able to admit to my friends how I felt and that I had seen a doctor about it, it was amazing how quickly many of them shared that they'd been going through the same thing. It's awful that so many people can relate to this problem, but there's strength in numbers. Like Harry said in the interview, he's part of \"quite a big club.\"\n\nAnd an added bonus? The more people get talking about their own struggles with depression and mental illness, the less stigmatized they become, and maybe, it will really help someone who needs to hear that they're not alone and that it's OK to ask for help when they need it. It can be really stressful and hard just being a person, but if it can be easier, why not encourage people to take that first step in living a happier and healthier life?\n\nIt's awesome that Harry (along with William and Kate Middleton) has decided to make this his mission through the UK's Heads Together campaign, and that he's speaking so candidly about why this is personal for him.

Unfortunately, the subject carries a stigma in many societies, and as workplace mental health statistics show, that's especially true of professional settings. While people may talk about their struggles with mental health more openly these days, the workplace is seen as an environment where employees are meant to maintain a facade of hard-working, focused perfection. Even when workers disclose mental health problems, getting help from employers proves difficult all too often.\n\nThat's why this year, the theme of World Mental Health Day in 2017 is \"mental health in the workplace.\" As the WHO explains on its website, people spend much of their time at work every week, and as a result, \"our experience in the workplace is one of the factors determining our overall wellbeing.\" To put it simply, problems at work can follow you home, and problems at home can follow you to work.\n\nAs you'll see from the following statistics, neglecting these problems has real consequences for millions of workers. Read on to see why this year's World Mental Health Day theme is so important.\n\n1 One in Four Americans Say Work Is A Source Of Anxiety Jad Limcaco/Unsplash Earlier this year, survey management company Ipsis published the results of a poll about American mental health, reporting that more than two thirds of respondents had experienced some kind of mental health problem in the past year. While personal problems were the most common stressor, 28 percent, or about one in four Americans, named their places of work as a source of anxiety. \"In fact, roughly a quarter say that they feel more stressed (24%) in the workplace this year compared to last year,\" researchers reported.\n\n2 Depression Cuts Productivity In a 2011 study, researchers looked at the relationship between depression and workplace productivity. Participants completed a survey called the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ9), which measures depression; the higher the score, the more depressed the person is. According to the study's results, severity of depression is directly linked to a loss of productivity. After adjusting for outside factors, researchers found that with every one point increase in the PHQ-9 score, workers lost productivity by nearly two percent. Although they were physically present at work, depression kept them from fully functioning \u2014 a phenomenon called presenteeism.\n\n3 Half Of Employees With Anxiety Say It Interferes With Coworker Relationships Rawpixel.com/Unsplash In a survey by the Anxiety Disorders Association of America (ADAA), nearly 50 percent of respondents diagnosed with an anxiety disorder said it interfered with their relationships with coworkers, whether it caused them to avoid social situations or stay quiet in meetings. More than half also said work triggered symptoms of their disorder.\n\n4 Only One In Four Employees With Anxiety Tell Employers In the same survey, ADAA researchers found that only one in four employees disclosed their anxiety disorder to their employer. Most of the reasons could be traced back to the stigma around mental disorders: 38 percent said they were worried their bosses would think it was an excuse to get out of work, while 34 percent said they thought it would negatively influence promotion opportunities.\n\n5 Depression Costs Employers More Than Other Health Conditions Chad Madden/Unsplash In a 2009 study looking at the financial impact of employee health problems at 10 different companies, researchers tallied up the cost of medical, drug, absenteeism, and presenteeism. Depression was the most expensive condition, followed by obesity, arthritis, back or neck pain, and anxiety. That's two mental health problems in a list of the most costly health conditions.\n\n6 3.5 Percent Of Workers Have ADHD A 2008 paper screened thousands of workers in 10 countries for symptoms of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a condition associated with attention problems. Researchers discovered that 3.5 percent of workers showed symptoms of the disorder, but only a \"small minority\" ever received treatment for ADHD. On top of being less likely to graduate from high school or college, people with ADHD also make 20 to 40 percent less money than coworkers without the disorder, even when controlling for academic achievements.\n\n7 Depressed Employees Lose 27 Work Days Per Year Ben Blennerhassett/Unsplash According to the Harvard Mental Health Letter, researchers analyzing a 2006 WHO mental health questionnaire found that depression costs not only money, but time. Employees with depression reported the equivalent of 27 missed work days per year. Of these days, 18 were the result of lower productivity, and nine were sick or personal days.\n\n9 Four In Five Workers Report Poor Work-Life Balance The importance of work-life balance is widely acknowledged, especially now that technology has made disconnecting from the workplace is increasingly difficult. Unfortunately, a 2006 report found that only 29 percent of employers say their company offers work-life balance, and the number of employees who agree is even lower \u2014 just one in five. Furthermore, the same report found that 52 percent of workers say their company does not do enough to promote employee health.", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/p/9-workplace-mental-health-statistics-that-show-why-this-years-world-mental-health-day-theme-is-so-important-2840292", "summary": "Each year, the World Health Organization (WHO) observes World Mental Health Day, highlighting the importance of maintaining mental as well as physical health.\nUnfortunately, the subject carries a stigma in many societies, and as workplace mental health statistics show, that's especially true of professional settings.\nThat's why this year, the theme of World Mental Health Day in 2017 is \"mental health in the workplace.\"\nRead on to see why this year's World Mental Health Day theme is so important.\nThat's two mental health problems in a list of the most costly health conditions.", "timescraped": 1513838386.2462661, "category": {"words": 840, "personal": 1, "thirdperson": 16, "condition": 29, "recovery": 1}}, "cbccf1ab381853899104910e1784a426": {"title": "How Therapists Are Failing LGBTQ Millennials", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/uploads/image/2017/8/24/060ae369-8ad0-44f3-bb95-2e7018c60df7-brooke-cagle-195779.jpg?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "text": "Nicole, 25, originally sought out a therapist because she thought she was in a toxic relationship. But during her initial appointment, the therapist only wanted to focus on one thing \u2014 whether or not she was actually bisexual, or if it was \u201cjust a phase.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe thought that because I was bisexual, I was in an experimentation phase and was I gay or was I not,\u201d she tells Bustle. \u201cI was and am perfectly comfortable with being bisexual. So that was difficult \u2014 the idea that the only problem I could be dealing with was self-discovery.\u201d\n\nNicole's story is unfortunately common among young LGBTQ people, who often find the discrimination and lack of understanding they experience in the culture at large replicated in the offices of professionals who are supposed to help them care for their mental health.\n\nPeople in the LGBTQ community are almost three times more likely to experience a mental health condition, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, and the rate of suicide attempts among LGBTQ youth is four times greater than it is for straight youth \u2014 and, as Jeremy Goldbach, assistant professor the University of Southern California\u2019s Master of Social Work program, tells Bustle, research shows that queer and trans people\u2019s mental health struggles are likely the result of a culture that rejects their sexuality and gender.\n\n\u201cIt's becoming clear that it isn't by nature of being gay or lesbian that places you at risk,\u201d says Goldbach. \u201cIt\u2019s the environment's response to you as young LGBTQ person or as an adult because we grow up in this environment that tells us that the core identity we have is wrong.\u201d\n\nDue to this lack of support, many younger LGBTQ people are turning away from traditional therapy or exploring alternatives models, instead of waiting for people in the mental health profession to catch up.\n\nTherapists Who Think LGBTQ Sexuality & Gender Are \"Trendy\"\n\nAlthough acceptance of the LGBTQ community appears to be increasing overall, there is still a learning curve for older generations who didn\u2019t grow up with the same awareness of gender fluidity or the spectrum of sexual orientations. Even therapists, who are often on the forefront of progressive understandings of the human experience, can still have dated views about gender and sexuality. Many millennials who spoke to Bustle say older therapists tended to be less accepting, partly because they considered their sexuality or gender to be a phase. Some of the millennials interviewed say their therapists even seemed to think their gender identity was a choice they made in order to be \u201ctrendy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think part of it has to do with being young and not having people respect young adults\u2019 choices for themselves.\u201d\n\nJordan, 29, who identifies as queer and trans and lives in Queens, New York, tells Bustle that therapists they\u2019ve seen sometimes struggle to use they/them pronouns instead of he/she. \u201cIt\u2019s important to me to find someone who would listen in a non-judgmental way to the language I use to describe myself and what my own individual wants or needs are to get out of therapy, and not bring their own feelings about gender or transition into the session,\u201d Jordan says. They say it\u2019s difficult for trans people to experience a lack of acceptance from society at large and then walk into a therapist\u2019s room and encounter the same judgment.\n\n\u201cA lot of people were more polite, but you could tell that when you asked about pronouns they would act like you were being a snowflake, essentially,\u201d Alicia, a 27 year-old who identifies as bisexual and nonbinary, tells Bustle. \u201cI think part of it has to do with being young and not having people respect young adults\u2019 choices for themselves and thinking that when you\u2019re older you won\u2019t be bi and you won\u2019t be nonbinary.\u201d\n\nAmong the other complaints about lack of acceptance around nonbinary identities and bisexuality, queer and trans millennials interviewed for this piece say that there was a tendency for therapists to focus so much on their sexuality or gender that they didn\u2019t examine anything else in their lives. Nicole says bisexuality was just one of the reasons she had a complicated relationship with her parents, but for that one therapist, it was the focus of every session.\n\n\u201cA lot of therapists get really hung up on thinking that I have internalized homophobia or that my issues all have to do with coming out.\"\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of therapists who say they\u2019re LGBTQ-friendly and I\u2019ve never actually been able to work on the issues I want to work on,\u201d Nicole said. \u201cA lot of therapists get really hung up on thinking that I have internalized homophobia or that my issues all have to do with coming out. Nothing else in my life gets any attention from therapists who say they\u2019re 'LGBTQ-friendly.'\u201d\n\nJordan said they felt some of their sessions with therapists were \u201cconsumed by\u201d the issue of gender.\n\n\u201cIt was a thing where we couldn't really get past it because they weren't really on same page, so it was struggle to feel like could relate to or trust them,\u201d Jordan said.\n\n\u201cThis is just another facet of human diversity.\"\n\n\u201cA lot of the gap is terminology and cultural understanding,\u201d Chanach (their middle name), a 26 year-old, queer and gender-nonconforming person tells Bustle. \u201cEspecially for people like me there are added complications. I'm a dyke, and that's easy enough for a straight person to swallow. But being [nonbinary] means that even within the queer community there's not a lot of knowledge and awareness unless you're very in the community.\u201d\n\nThomas Coughlin, a licensed psychotherapist in practice in Washington, DC, and an educator who does trainings on issues relating to transgender people\u2019s health, tells Bustle that therapists need to understand this is just one part of who is someone is.\n\nChanach holds hands with their girlfriend. (photo c/o Chanach)\n\n\u201cThis is just another facet of human diversity. They\u2019re still a student struggling in school or dealing with family issues or addiction issues but people get focused and see everything through the lens of someone\u2019s transgender identity,\u201d Coughlin says.\n\n\"'It Goes Against Everything I\u2019ve Known And Practiced For 20 Years.'\"\n\nMany of the therapists who spoke with Bustle admitted the schools and programs that are training future therapists and social workers have a lot of catching up to do when it comes to working with LGBTQ community. Goldbach says that he thinks therapists could improve their approach toward all minority populations, but that therapists struggle to address the LGBTQ community in particular. Many therapists who lack training for working with LGBTQ clients, Goldbach notes, tend to either ignore sexuality and gender or focus so much on sexuality and gender that they didn\u2019t see the whole person.\n\n\u201cThey avoid it entirely and sort of don't want to touch it because they're not sure. Or they take the approach of \u2018Let's make everything about your sexual identity, because clearly that is the core of what is what's going wrong for you. So there needs to be more education,\u201d Goldbach explains.\n\nAccording to a June 2015 article published in the journal Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice which examined how clinical psychology programs could improve their training to better address the needs of LGBTQ clients, many training programs only address LGBTQ populations when a trainee first treats a client who identifies as belonging to the community. The authors write that conversations about gender and sexuality should be better integrated into the curriculum \"well before students start to work therapeutically with clients.\"\n\n\u201cA lot of younger people in the community are using different labels that maybe those of us who are older have never heard of, like pansexual, aromantic, asexual.\"\n\nHowever, as the article points out, it\u2019s tough to make the changes necessary to improve cultural competency because that requires that faculty have a baseline level of commitment and competence on these issues to begin with, and some senior faculty members may have outdated training. The authors also note that \"many if not most psychology training programs will lack a faculty member with personal experience, training, or expertise in transgender issues and treatment.\"\n\nDeborah Duley, MSW, LGSW, is the clinical director of Empowered Connections, LLC, a therapy practice based in Maryland. Duley, who graduated in 2012 from Howard University, tells Bustle she wasn\u2019t aware of classes she could take or certifications she could get to be an LGBTQ-affirming therapist. Duley sought out informal classes and trainings on her own after she graduated, and she recently took a class on suicide prevention for the LGBTQ community which was hosted by her county health department.\n\n\u201cA lot of younger people in the community are using different labels that maybe those of us who are older have never heard of like pansexual, aromantic, asexual,\u201d says Duley. \u201cA lot of the people in the trainings had never heard of that before and didn\u2019t know what they meant.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, Duley didn\u2019t see many other therapists at the training. In her estimation, only eight of the 40 people who attended were therapists. Duley says her community is fairly conservative, and that probably has something to do with it.\n\n\u201cThere may be more of a pushback [with older groups], more of a debate instead of \u2018Oh that\u2019s interesting. Tell me more.'\"\n\nCoughlin says that he occasionally sees some resistance to his training on gender and sexuality from some of the older therapists he trains, many of whom have been in the field for two decades or more. \u201cThere may be more of a pushback [with older groups], more of a debate instead of \u2018Oh that\u2019s interesting. Tell me more,\u2019\u201d Coughlin says. \u201cThere is this sense that I have to debate them because, \u2018It goes against everything I\u2019ve known and practiced for 20 years as a therapist. And now you\u2019re telling me this new thing and I have to learn this new thing and unlearn this other stuff and you\u2019re telling me it\u2019s not static.\u2019\u201d\n\nCoughlin says that despite his expertise and years of conducting trainings, he has to remind himself to keep learning. He says he learns something new from every training he does.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know it all and I have to remember that,\u201d Coughlin says.\n\nDuley says she\u2019s always tweaking her approach and learning more about what it means to be cisgender and how to talk about gender with gender minority clients. For instance, she learned from a training that she should ask, \u201cWhat pronoun would you like me to use?\u201d instead of \u201cWhat is your preferred pronoun?\u201d The latter phrasing suggests they are claiming a pronoun that doesn\u2019t really belong to them, Duley notes; that isn\u2019t really their true pronoun.\n\n\u201cI definitely have changed that because I didn\u2019t realize that small little tweak was important,\u201d Duley says.\n\n\"I Think The Change Will Come\"\n\nA \u201csmall little tweak,\u201d such as dropping the word \u201cpreferred\u201d when asking about pronouns is, as many of the young LGBTQ people pointed out to Bustle, incredibly meaningful. Not only that, but finding an affirming therapist \u2014 one that doesn't just adjust their language, but actually sees the whole you \u2014 can be absolutely life-changing, which makes makes putting in any extra work to find the right one totally worth it. For folks like Chanach, that means narrowing down their options by asking their friends and other members of their LGBTQ communities for recommendations.\n\n\u201cWhen straight, cis people recommend their therapists to me, I tend to nod, smile, and ignore them because they have no idea what I need. Queer people, on the other hand, tend to know what I mean and why it's such a struggle,\u201d says Chanach.\n\nAlicia takes a selfie. (photo c/o: Alicia)\n\nGiven the hurdles that they face finding affirming therapists, many queer and trans people simply create their own options, such as peer counseling groups, or seeking help through online therapy services.\n\nThe flexibility of peer counseling groups or online therapy is necessary for another reason \u2014 people in the LGBTQ community, particularly LGBTQ people of color , are also more likely to be low-income. which means they don\u2019t always have insurance or the cash to spend on an out-of-network therapist.\n\n\"I've always dreaded therapy because of the in-person component.\u201d\n\nChanach says they were considering Talkspace, an online and mobile therapy company, however, because events like the shooting at the Pulse nightclub and the election were stressful and have motivated them to go back to therapy.\n\n\u201cIt's been a rough year, and increasingly I'm looking into my finances to see if I can swing trying it,\u201d Chanach says. \u201cThe appeal of TalkSpace for me is, among other things, it's virtual, which takes a weight off. I don't have to travel out of my way, which takes time and money, and it's also great for social anxiety \u2014 I've always dreaded therapy because of the in-person component.\u201d\n\nAlicia, who has depression, anxiety, and Asperger syndrome, tells Bustle they have been dealing with thoughts of suicide since they were about 10 or 11 years old. They use peer support, which means they seek support from people of similar lived experiences who are trained or have degrees in counseling.\n\nOn their own accord, Alicia has also helped create programs to train people to work as counselors for LGBTQ people. Alicia said the peer support program they work for tries to be as inclusive as possible by hiring people in the community, doing trainings on how to support LGBTQ people, and making sure to respond to feedback from queer and trans people to make sure they meet the community's needs.\n\n\u201cI think the change will come,\u201d says Alicia. \u201cA lot of people who struggle to find a therapist actually ended up being advocates.

I know some folks who meticulously count the days to Hallow\u2019s Eve or plan their costumes for months, but as a mentally ill person, I find the holiday anxiety-provoking. In many ways, Halloween-themed activities trigger my PTSD, and create shame around my mental health issues, and I'm not alone. When you have a mental illness, celebrating Halloween can be a major trigger. Bustle spoke to millennials about how they cope when this time of year triggers anxiety or other responses, and how people without mental illness can be mindful of those triggers.\n\nIf you live without mental illness, you may be thinking this is all in my head. And guess what? You\u2019re totally right \u2014 it is, indeed, all in my head \u2014 but that does not make my mental illness any less valid. Mental illness can alter the size of different areas in your brain, including the amygdala. According to Psychology Today, the amygdala works as \u201can 'emotion storing\u2019 brain region that is often associated with primal fear-based responses such as automatically jumping or shrieking if you mistake a garden hose in your backyard for a snake.\u201d Conclusively, if this part of your brain doesn\u2019t function as it is supposed to, it\u2019s no surprise that graphic horror movies or haunted houses could induce a panic attack. Additionally, mental illness can cause emotional dysregulation and change the chemical responses in one\u2019s brain. Therefore, mentally ill people process stressful experiences (i.e., a haunted house or cornfield maze) in a vastly different way when compared to someone without a mental illness. Your mentally ill friend who does not want to participate in Halloween festivities is not \u201cweak\u201d or \u201cfaking it.\" They just have a different experience than you.\n\nHappy Halloween season! Asylum haunted houses are trash and mental illness is not a costume! \ud83c\udf83\ud83d\udc7b \u2014 Jess (@jromes19) October 1, 2017\n\nTriggers often are misconstrued as weakness or a choice, no thanks to political commentators like Tomi Lahren who appropriated the term to use as an insult. The politicization of the word \u201ctriggered\u201d reinforces negative stigmas about mental illness, and may even stop folks from seeking the support or treatment they need. Kim, an activist with Utahns Speak Out, tells Bustle, \"An ex thought it would be fun to see The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake when it came out, and I tried, but ended up having to close my eyes and cover my ears for 99% of the movie.\u201d She adds that she was \"fighting back tears because I didn\u2019t want to be the loser who cries during a Texas Chainsaw movie.\u201d Unfortunately, Kim\u2019s experience is not unique, as it reflects the pressure (aka, internalized ableism) so many of us who struggle with mental health issues feel. Before I understood my own mental illness, I strived to be the \u201cgood\u201d mentally ill person, meaning I basically kept my diagnosis secret, and didn't ask for external support. Often times, I refused to advocate for myself, my needs, and my limitations, which is so crucial to do.\n\nSome aspects of Halloween may also play into harmful tropes about mental health disorders, which in turn negatively impact mentally ill people, and skew public perception of what mental illness is actually like. A 27-year-old woman, who requested to remain anonymous, tells Bustle, \u201cI can't handle watching horror movies with the setting or plot line regarding a mental hospital or mental illness. It's too triggering to have such negative stereotypes and violence/danger associated with mental illness,\u201d adding, \u201cI'm not evil because I have bipolar disorder, and movies with [plot lines about mental hospitals and mental illness] can communicate that people with mental health struggles are evil. It can be very damaging.\u201d\n\nNot only do asylum-themed haunted houses further stigmatize mentally ill people, but they draw inspiration from a painful history. \u201cSome of the things that happened in [mental institutions] not so far in the past were beyond barbaric and disturbing, especially to women and LGBTQ+ people,\u201d says Anna, a store manager, who consequently fears \"being locked away and stripped of my freedom because people don't understand [my mental illness].\u201d Mental illness is not a prop, and when haunted houses feature mental institutions, they make light of a not-so-distant past that brutalized mentally ill women, or women who simply defied assigned gender roles.\n\nWhile many folks with mental health issues actively avoid Halloween-themed activities, there are quite a few who actually find horror movies and haunted houses to be therapeutic. \u201cI have pretty severe PTSD and, strangely enough, all the horror actually really makes me feel better,\u201d says Blue, a high school senior. \u201c[Horror movies] remind me that fear is normal and everyone feels it. And it re-associates the feelings of fear with supernatural things that will never actually happen, instead of my past.\u201d Dr. Mathias Clasen, from Aarhus University in Denmark, told Broadly that \u201cThe [horror] genre allows us to voluntarily \u2014 and under controlled circumstances \u2014 get experience with negative emotion.\" In a way, horror can help some mentally ill people reprocess, or even recover from fear or trauma in a safe, controlled environment. This method of coping is definitely not for everyone, myself included, and probably is a choice best decided between one and their support system.\n\nAttending a 'haunted house' for Halloween this year? Please think twice about choosing one that mocks mental illness and perpetuates stigma. \u2014 Zo\u00eb Alicia \ud83c\udf83 (@ZoeAlicia101) September 12, 2017\n\nSo, how can you better support your mentally ill friends around Halloween? The first steps are to simply listen, empathize, and validate them. If you go to a Halloween-themed event with a friend who starts to panic, show support \u2014 not frustration. Nicole, a college student and healthcare professional, tells Bustle, \u201cI wish there was a way to hide horror movie ads on Facebook and Pandora. It's very anxiety provoking for me.\u201d Her suggestion to nest or block content is such a small request, but it could keep many mentally ill people from feeling overwhelmed, or even stop a panic attack from happening before it even begins.\n\nI'm definitely not asking those who are Halloween-obsessed to not enjoy or participate in Halloween (seriously, go wild!), but I\u2019m requesting that you think of those around you who may have a different perception of the creepy holiday than you do. Respect that for many people with mental illness, Halloween can serve to trigger our mental health issues, further stigmatize us, and set mental health advocacy back. And that's scarier than any demon, ghost, or ghoul.", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/p/celebrating-halloween-when-you-have-a-mental-illness-can-be-triggering-this-is-how-to-cope-2779125", "summary": "When you have a mental illness, celebrating Halloween can be a major trigger.\nIf you live without mental illness, you may be thinking this is all in my head.\nYou\u2019re totally right \u2014 it is, indeed, all in my head \u2014 but that does not make my mental illness any less valid.\nIt's too triggering to have such negative stereotypes and violence/danger associated with mental illness,\u201d adding, \u201cI'm not evil because I have bipolar disorder, and movies with [plot lines about mental hospitals and mental illness] can communicate that people with mental health struggles are evil.\nRespect that for many people with mental illness, Halloween can serve to trigger our mental health issues, further stigmatize us, and set mental health advocacy back.", "timescraped": 1513838388.983069, "category": {"words": 1102, "personal": 17, "thirdperson": 10, "condition": 30, "recovery": 1}}, "a630ec098d3f56feb1bc983cab7d1a3f": {"title": "5 Things Your Therapist Won't Tell You (But Is Probably Thinking)", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost%2F2016%2F9%2F13%2F5c00a012-cd22-464b-aecf-e51d72fb1843.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "text": "Unless you find yourself hosting The View, every job in the world requires a bit of censorship. Your barista probably has a thought or two about your fussy order, as does your professor about the pajamas you wore to class. Your therapist is no exception. In fact, we are on the extreme end of the spectrum \u2014 often, our words are chosen at a White House Press Secretary-level of consideration. Which is exactly why therapy only works when certain conditions are met: To start, we don\u2019t want to make the relationship about us. You wouldn\u2019t be paying for counseling if you wanted us to chat with you the same way you chat with your friends; or if we pulled the rug out from under you just with a stinging comment straight from your mom's repertoire.\n\n\n\nWords have power; there is no doubt. A \u201cHe\u2019s Just Not That Into You\u201d-level comment may jerk your head in a different direction, but that doesn\u2019t mean harsh truths are the stuff of real change. And that\u2019s probably why you\u2019ll never have a Dr. Laura moment with a real professional, regardless of what they might be thinking. The best truths are the ones you participate in unraveling, because they\u2019re the ones you\u2019re more likely to take seriously.\n\nBut for those of you who just can\u2019t help but be curious, here\u2019s a little peek into what\u2019s going on in your therapist\u2019s brain \u2014 and what she\u2019ll probably never say to you point blank.\n\n1. \"If you\u2019re just looking for support, you\u2019re wasting your time.\"\n\nHarsh, right? But it\u2019s the truth. A client ready to take responsibility for their problems and the solutions is a thousand times more likely to get something out of the experience. You can show up every week and pay a therapist to make sympathetic noises and agree that your last boyfriend was an absolute tool, but you\u2019re never going to get anywhere. We might as well be somewhere ordering mimosas and casually checking our smartphones. Taking your side is a job for friends and family.\n\nIs there support in therapy? Yes. Is support alone enough to help you change? Nope.\n\n\n\n2. \"I can relate.\"\n\nIn my experience, I\u2019ve yet to meet a fellow therapist who\u2019s the epitome of mental health. Many therapists struggle with self-doubt, work/life balance, family issues, and even mental illness. Expecting us to be masters of mental health is like asking your doctor to never catch a cold.\n\n\n\nYou might think it would be refreshing to hear your counselor say, \u201cDude, I struggle with negative thinking all the time.\u201d But the problem is that if I share my own problems, then it becomes about me. And it was never supposed to be about me. So just know that while I might make a strategy sound like a breeze, I\u2019m laughing at myself three days later when I have my own crisis and remember how difficult change really can be.\n\n3. \"I hope you don't stop coming when things start to get better.\"\n\nWhen you're sick, you stop going to the doctor when your symptoms start to improve. So why shouldn\u2019t therapy be any different? Often, symptoms of depression or anxiety might start to fade as you work with a therapist and make changes in your thinking or behaviors. And so you stop coming. That money could be better spent, right? But if you haven\u2019t changed the relationship or behavior patterns that contribute to these symptoms, then you\u2019re likely destined to struggle with the same issues in the future.\n\n\n\nBut often, therapy is most effective when the symptoms aren\u2019t so severe. That way, you are less reactive and can think more clearly about how your decisions impact your mental health. And just like medicine, prevention is much more powerful and effective than simply treating symptoms.\n\n4. \"You're so not ready to stop being rescued.\"\n\nMaybe you\u2019re content to dive into another codependent relationship to avoid what it feels like to be alone with your thoughts. We wouldn\u2019t do what we do if it didn\u2019t work in some way, right?\n\nThe sooner you\u2019re ready to take responsibility for your own actions and emotions, the more you can grow as an adult. At some point, you have to stop letting others do things for you that you can do yourself. But guess what? If I as the therapist try to drag you kicking and screaming out of that unhealthy pattern, and I take responsibility for your improvement, then I\u2019m no better than your mother who drove you here.\n\nLack of autonomy is not something a \u201csnap out of it\u201d statement can fix. It takes time for you to understand patterns in relationships and take responsibility for yourself. Therapy is a high wire act. It happens inch by inch, and with time you won\u2019t need that safety net quite as much.\n\n5. \"Here's what you should do:\"\n\nI will stop writing about how change is hard when it stops being hard. But until our alien overlords arrive with that solution, therapy will continue to be about digging in your heels, being uncomfortable sometimes, and making mistakes along the way. Real change is like a good TV show \u2014 if everything were resolved in the first episode then we wouldn\u2019t bother to root for our favorite character. It\u2019s more of a journey, but ultimately more rewarding in the end.\n\n\n\nIt's true your therapist might have some pretty blunt opinions when it comes to how you life your live. But what's good for you ultimately has very little to do about our opinion. Only you can decide what it would take for you want to live and feel differently. While our thoughts might be intriguing, you're the expert when it comes to knowing yourself. We may tilt the mirror so you can get a closer look, but the person you see staring back is up to you.\n\nImages: HBO; Giphy", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/65974-5-things-your-therapist-wont-tell-you-but-is-probably-thinking", "summary": "And that\u2019s probably why you\u2019ll never have a Dr. Laura moment with a real professional, regardless of what they might be thinking.\nIn my experience, I\u2019ve yet to meet a fellow therapist who\u2019s the epitome of mental health.\nWhen you're sick, you stop going to the doctor when your symptoms start to improve.\nOften, symptoms of depression or anxiety might start to fade as you work with a therapist and make changes in your thinking or behaviors.\nIt's true your therapist might have some pretty blunt opinions when it comes to how you life your live.", "timescraped": 1513838390.24335, "category": {"words": 974, "personal": 22, "thirdperson": 2, "condition": 6, "recovery": 0}}, "df6e9ee476af51c979fa29b4e7444208": {"title": "What Is Sex Like When You Have Anxiety? 8 People Share Their Experiences", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost/2016/9/13/9c30866b-0917-41a9-9a6b-a0a3093232c7.jpg?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "text": "Our society already doesn't allow us a whole lot of room (if any room at all, actually) to openly discuss our mental health in a safe, empathetic, and helpful way. Mental illness is \"invisible,\" so it is considered secondary, if not outright imaginary, when compared to physical ailments. We may not often talk about mental health struggles such as anxiety, but pretending the disorders aren't real doesn't prevent them from happening. Combine the silence and stigmatization surrounding mental health with our overwhelmingly sex-negative, shaming culture, and it's no wonder that we never really honestly speak about how anxiety affects sexuality and relationships. And this silence remains despite the extremely large number of people dealing with some form of anxiety, and the fact that anxiety can permeate every aspect of our lives.\n\nAccording to the National Institute of Mental Health, 18.1 percent of the adult population in this country are diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. That comes out to approximately 40 million adults between the ages of 18 to 54. Anxiety disorders are broken down into several types of disorders, including panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, phobias, and generalized anxiety disorder. As you will read in the accounts shared by numerous people below, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is extremely common among survivors of sexual assault and sexual abuse. As a result, sexual activity, even when it is consensual, can trigger flashbacks and panic attacks. In fact, studies show that survivors are \"6.2 times more likely to develop PTSD\" than women who have not experienced rape.\n\nAnxiety can be treated through counseling, medication, therapy, open communication, a combination of all of the above, and lots of other methods. When we are afraid to discuss our anxiety and the role it plays in our sex lives, it is hard to develop trust and boundaries, so it's hard to achieve the healthy pleasure that we deserve. Let's combat the stigma by talking openly about what it's like to be in sexual relationships while managing anxiety. Here is what eight people had to say:\n\n1. Medication Can Dull Sensation, But It Is Often Worth It\n\n\"I am diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder. Without medication, I suffer from intense bouts of anxiety that can leave me paralyzed. During the periods that I was single, I used to have a lot of anxiety about potential sexual partners. I wasn't too fond of the idea of one-night stands because I couldn't trust that they wouldn't hurt me... A lot of that anxiety stemmed from past sexual abuse, so I was extremely protective of myself. Now I am in a great relationship with someone I can see my future with. We have a great sex life, but when I started taking an anti-depressant for my anxiety, it really affected my capacity to have an orgasm.\n\nFor about two months I was almost completely anorgasmic. Penetration felt good, but my clit was numb. This is a common side effect when initially taking anti-depressants. I tried not to let it bum me out too much because I was really grateful for the relief from my anxiety even though I was used to having fantastic orgasms with my partner. After three months, I have regained most of my ability to orgasm, though it is delayed. Hopefully my ability to orgasm will reach it's full potential again, but I will take the compromise for regaining my emotional and mental health.\" - Theresa, 28\n\n2. Becoming Comfortable With Your Sexuality Is A Gradual Process Helped By Supportive Partners\n\n\u201cSometimes I still have to make a conscious effort to try to love and appreciate my body and all of its capabilities. I have a partner now who loves everything about my body, but it took a while before I was able to be totally comfortable with him seeing every part of me. Every encounter with my boyfriend has always been consensual, but there have definitely been times where I've felt the need to disassociate because the experience is so overwhelming. This caused some early encounters to be painful and embarrassing. There have definitely been tears \u2014 both happy and sad. Like, I cried the first time I had an orgasm. I just have a lot of feelings, and a lot of the time they're unpredictable!\n\nAs our relationship has grown (it's been almost five years), my boyfriend and I have learned to be completely open with each other. I'm able to say straight up, 'hey, I just don't know if I can handle this right now. I'm feeling way too anxious' and he'll just get it. He's become more in touch with his own emotions, and can recognize anxiety within himself... We're also both on depression and anxiety medications that have made a world of difference in stabilizing our emotions and allowing communication to flow more freely. Even if there's a chance that these meds lower both of our libidos (I honestly wouldn't know since I've been on meds since I was 14), they've still allowed us to have a completely fulfilling sex life. We don't do it as often as we might like, but when we do, it's almost a spiritual experience where I feel like we're the only two people in the world. It's awesome.\u201d - Violet, 25\n\n3. It Can Feel Like You Don't Deserve Love\n\n\"I'm pretty well-regulated now (shout out to DBT therapy and finally figuring out a good medication regimen!) But there have been lots of times where I've been totally overwhelmed by my mental sh*t. This has obviously affected my relationship to my boyfriend. He is the person I'm around the most, so the person my disorders affect the most (apart from me, obviously) is him. And a lot of my anxiety is in relation to my body, which obviously affects my sex life. There have been times when I haven't been able to be touched because I hate how I look or because any physical contact brings up rape-related trauma feelings. And there have been times when I've started crying because I'm not getting enough physical contact and therefore feel like [my boyfriend] doesn't love me at all, that I'm ugly and worthless and unlovable. Depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder do this thing where they convince you that you have no value, that every aspect of your being is garbage. I've had this thing a lot in my 'sexual history' where I've been so convinced that I'm worthless/ugly/unlovable that I trust people more who seem to hate me, because their hatred confirms my own self-loathing and vice versa.\n\nMy current boyfriend of almost two years genuinely loves, values, and respects me and makes me feel safe... But I still have trouble believing that he really likes me, and that is all so much based in anxiety and depression and my sense of worthlessness and emptiness... Our sex life is really good the majority of the time, like kinda mind-blowing and close and special. But when the tentacles of anxiety wrap around me, it's like I'm not even in my body anymore. I'm way more in control of this than I used to be... I [no longer] seek out degradation from strangers who I hate and who put me in unsafe situations.\" - Tori, 22\n\n4. You Can Achieve Fulfilling Relationships And Struggle With Mental Health Simultaneously\n\n\"I was diagnosed with depression and Generalized Anxiety Disorder in 2009. I [found] myself clinging to people who showed me any type of love, affection, or attention. I began taking anti-depressants and going to therapy. On my road to recovery, I placed my energy in things I loved to do and got rid of the toxic people in my life. I soon realized that the most important type of love is the love that you have for yourself... I am now in a loving, healthy long-term relationship with a wonderful man. I still struggle with anxiety, but I maintain a positive outlook on life and do my best to stay happy and healthy.\" - Mia, 25\n\n5. Illness-Related PTSD Makes It Hard To Trust Your Body\n\n\"A couple years ago, I very suddenly got very sick and nearly died. I was hospitalized for over a month, and though I fully recovered, the mysterious illness, invasive procedures, and traumatic recovery made me feel like I couldn't trust my body, as if it wasn't the body I thought I'd known for my entire life. I was diagnosed with PTSD after leaving the hospital, and I couldn't imagine ever being comfortable enough with this new, strange body to be physically intimate with anyone again. Thankfully, I got over that discomfort after a year and have since had wonderful sexual experiences. However, PTSD and anxiety manifest themselves in a different, really specific way now in regards to sex.\n\nAfter everything happened, doctors let me know that pregnancy could be extremely dangerous for my health for multiple reasons. Since I don't want to have kids biologically anyway (if ever), that didn't upset me, but it made me terrified of accidentally becoming pregnant. Kind of like, no matter how safe or careful I am about pregnancy prevention, something will go wrong and I'll wind up pregnant because my body can't be trusted. And while I thankfully live in a state where I can easily access abortion should anything ever happen (by the way, my birth control methods have never failed, yet the anxiety remains), it's just a really stressful, expensive thing to think about. While I am happy to say that anxiety over a dangerous unplanned pregnancy does not creep up on me every time that I am sexually active, it still pops up in my brain and takes me out of the moment more often than I'd like it to. But I think I'll feel more secure in my health and my contraception choices as time goes on.\" - Josie, 26\n\n6. Touch Can Feel Threatening After Trauma\n\n\"Back when I was in eleventh grade, our family was undergoing a sustained five-month siege of police violence in our small, corrupt Southern town. Since my mom was darker skinned and an immigrant, we were always looked at as 'outsiders.' This unpredictable violence more-or-less caused a constant anxiety for me as well as my parents and sisters, not only from the fear of what could happen to us from the police, but also due to the fact that the stress of everything was literally tearing our family apart.I started dating a young lady, and when we started our relationship (which coincidentally began during the madness), I didn't mention anything that was going wrong and compartmentalized the relationship part of my life. I think the anxiety and stress from everything around un-did some of our chemistry too. By four months in, my girlfriend and I realized we couldn't express love to each other in the languages that we understood anymore, and we grew more distant until we broke it off. I got more unresponsive to her physical touch, as my mind was associating any foreign touch as something that could be a threat.\" - Steven, 25\n\n7. Casual Sex Is Difficult And Communication Is Key\n\n\"Anxiety makes it hard for me to open up to my partners about my needs and wants in the bedroom. This makes casual sex pretty challenging, since I won't make a peep about how to better please me until I've known someone for at least six months. Sometimes, that never comes at all. In my current relationship, that communication finally came through e-mail. So I e-mailed my partner a list of things I would like and that he could do better for me in the bedroom. It turned into a very long and certainly the strangest e-mail exchange I've ever had. But my partner appreciated it! He says he still goes back to that first e-mail from time to time, to remind himself how to please me.\" - Elizabeth, 26\n\n8. Intimacy Between Long-Term Partners Can Change Throughout The Years\n\n\"My anxiety has pretty much killed my sex drive. It's made me feel more incredibly vulnerable than ever before, despite being in a monogamous relationship for years. Having sex makes me feel more exposed as a result of my PTSD/anxiety diagnosis, and my partner struggles with this shift in our sex life. We're still intimate; it's just the penetrative sex part that's been difficult.\" - Emma, 24\n\nWant more of Bustle's Sex and Relationships coverage?

The new campaign is aimed at reducing the social stigma surrounding mental illness, pointing out that along with being a policy issue, properly addressing mental health is a cultural issue, too.\n\nIn a statement on the White House website, the first lady noted that mental health conditions affect one in five adults, but people often don't seek the help they need because they're worried about the social stigma.\n\nFolks are faced with all kinds of challenges. They are stretched thin at work. Their paychecks don\u2019t stretch far enough. Millions struggle every day just to get by. Then you add social, biological, and genetic factors on top of all that, and sometimes it\u2019s just too much.\n\nAt the Newseum in Washington, D.C., Michelle told the audience that it's wrong to treat people with mental illness differently from those suffering from illnesses like cancer or asthma. \u201cWhether an illness affects your heart, your leg or your brain, it\u2019s still an illness,\u201d she said, \u201cand there should be no distinction.\u201d\n\nAccording to the AP, the initiative was launched by the nonprofit organization Give An Hour, which has put together a network of more than 7,000 mental health care professionals. Other organizations participating in the Change Direction campaign include the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, The National Council for Behavioral Health, and Justice for Vets.\n\n\n\n[Twitter Embed: https://twitter.com/FLOTUS/statuses/573607362746937345]\n\nOn the Change Direction website, there's a list of five signs someone is struggling with mental illness to watch out for. Those signs include: personality or behavior changes, agitation and anxiety, withdrawal from other people, risky behavior, or neglecting hygiene, and hopelessness, or seeming overwhelmed.\n\n\n\nMichelle's interest in working to help those suffering from mental illness came from her work with the veterans' organization Joining Forces, which helps vets find jobs and other services. During her speech at the Newseum this week, Michelle told the story of decorated Navy veteran Ryan Rigdon, who returned from Iraq suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, and contemplated suicide.\n\nIn Ryan\u2019s story we hear the story of far too many of our veterans \u2014 the struggle to adjust to a new life. The terrors and anxieties that just won\u2019t go away, even when they\u2019re back home, safe in their own beds.\n\n\n\nMental health struggles are not unique to veterans, Michelle added; anyone suffering from depression or other mental disorders can improve their quality of life by seeking help and treatment. Connecting veterans and anyone else struggling with depression to resources will be the goal of the Change Direction initiative, Obama said.\n\nIf you're struggling and would like to talk to someone, please call the Crisis Call Center's 24-hour hotline at 775-784-8090 or text \"Answer\" to 839863.\n\n\n\nImage: Getty Images (1)\n\n", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/68166-michelle-obama-launches-change-direction-for-mental-health-awareness-and-its-a-necessary-conversation", "summary": "As an extension of her work with veterans, as well as her experience working with Sandy Hook families, First Lady Michelle Obama announced a new mental health initiative, Change Direction, this week.\nThe new campaign is aimed at reducing the social stigma surrounding mental illness, pointing out that along with being a policy issue, properly addressing mental health is a cultural issue, too.\n[Twitter Embed: https://twitter.com/FLOTUS/statuses/573607362746937345]On the Change Direction website, there's a list of five signs someone is struggling with mental illness to watch out for.\nMental health struggles are not unique to veterans, Michelle added; anyone suffering from depression or other mental disorders can improve their quality of life by seeking help and treatment.\nConnecting veterans and anyone else struggling with depression to resources will be the goal of the Change Direction initiative, Obama said.", "timescraped": 1513838392.987978, "category": {"words": 478, "personal": 2, "thirdperson": 11, "condition": 11, "recovery": 0}}, "3441836bcf187a4397481cf78edb0b0a": {"title": "5 Mental Illnesses That Are More Common Among Women", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost%2F2016%2F9%2F13%2F36399810-32ef-48bf-99f3-34c1f32c4691.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "text": "Although the stigma about mental illness is slowly being broken down, plenty of people still view their mental health struggles as a source of shame and are hesitant to seek help from medical professionals, family members, and friends. This is unfortunate, because when we discuss our mental health issues, we find out things that make us feel less alone \u2014 like that fact that a number of mental disorders are most common among women. In general, the consensus is that mental health issues are more common in women than men \u2014 especially certain disorders. Though recent research has shown that substance abuse is more common among men, and illnesses like ADHD and schizophrenia affect both genders equally, overall, women are 40 percent more likely than men to have mental health problems.\n\nThere's certainly a margin of error here, because it's been shown that women are more likely than men to seek a diagnosis and treatment if they're suffering from depression or anxiety, which may skew the statistics. But every mental illness is caused by a complex combination of genetic and environmental factors \u2014 and women may be at higher risk due to many of these factors. For starters, women have lower serotonin levels than men and our bodies process the chemical differently. And our predisposition to hormone fluctuations also puts us at a greater risk.\n\nThen there are the environmental factors to consider. Although men certainly face many of these struggles, women are more likely to live in poverty than men and we're at a greater risk of experiencing domestic violence and childhood sexual assault. These stressors and traumas can easily trigger a mental illness in any individual who's genetically vulnerable. With all this in mind, here are five forms of mental illness that tend to disproportionately affect women.\n\n1. Anxiety Disorders\n\nAnxiety disorders are twice as common in women as compared to men, according to multiple studies. Although income level appears to play a role in many mental illnesses, anxiety is not more common in any one income bracket \u2014 but it is more common in people under 35 and individuals with chronic physical illnesses. The New York Times cited cultural pressures placed upon women and a greater likelihood of reporting anxiety to doctors as possible factors in this statistic. There is also a biological component that could explain why women are more prone to anxiety \u2014 the \"fight or flight\" part of the brain becomes activated more quickly and remains activated for longer in women.\n\n2. PTSD\n\nAlthough women are slightly less likely to experience a traumatic event than men, females are twice as likely to develop PTSD. The American Psychiatric Association added PTSD to the The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 1980, after veterans returning from Vietnam exhibited many of the symptoms. For this reason, there's often the misconception that PTSD only affects veterans. But in reality, PTSD can be triggered by a wide variety of events, including car accidents, sexual abuse, surviving a natural disaster, and domestic violence.\n\nThe traumas most commonly experienced by women \u2014 such as sexual assault and domestic violence \u2014 are often intimate and personal, and the perpetrators are frequently people we know and trust. This is the main reason women are more likely to suffer from PTSD than men. Technically, PTSD is categorized as an anxiety disorder \u2014 but, unlike social or generalized anxiety disorders, it's tied to a specific event and the anxiety is triggered by reminders of this event. PTSD makes it incredibly hard to live your life, but treatment is highly effective \u2014 approximately 80 percent of people who seek professional help do recover, so it doesn't need to be a chronic condition.\n\n3. Specific Phobias\n\nPhobias are actually the most common mental disorder, but they often don't reach the point of interfering with a person's ability to function. Many people have irrational fears that they recognize are irrational and don't negatively impact their overall mental health. The difference between a \"fear\" and a \"phobia\" is that a phobia causes psychological impairment when a person is faced with the situation.\n\n\n\nOne of the most common illnesses in this class is agoraphobia \u2014 and women are three times as likely as men to be agoraphobic. Agoraphobia is characterized by intense anxiety regarding being in a public space, especially when it's crowded. The condition is usually preceded by a panic attack, which triggers the fear that another one will occur if the public space is reentered. If it goes untreated, agoraphobia can quickly escalate to the point where people are fearful of leaving their homes \u2014 and this, of course, severely limits their ability to function in their personal and professional lives.\n\nSocial phobia is also more common amongst women and it can be debilitating. Although this disorder is sometimes thought to be the same as shyness, it is not the same thing. People who are shy don't experience the extreme anxiety that characterizes a social phobia \u2014 and they don't necessarily avoid social situations. And people with social phobia can be comfortable with others in some situations, and have other situations trigger the phobia. The symptoms of social phobia include the belief that all eyes are on you and a fear of public speaking, dating, eating out, or talking on the phone in front of others.\n\n4. Panic Disorder\n\nPanic disorder involves repeated and unexpected panic attacks, which differs from generalized anxiety. A panic attack is characterized by shorter, more intense feelings of fear and includes physical sensations like a racing heart, trouble breathing, dizziness, nausea, chest pain, and shaking. At their worst, panic attacks can feel like having a heart attack or suffocating \u2014 some people even fear they're dying because the physical manifestations are so intense. Panic attacks go away on their own, but they're incredibly frightening and can be debilitating. Panic disorder is when the panic attacks are a common occurrence and the individual avoids any situation that may trigger an attack.\n\n\n\nWomen are twice as likely as men to experience panic attacks and panic disorder, though the exact reason for this is unclear. They're also more common amongst women who suffer from migraines, depression, and cardiovascular diseases.\n\n5. Depression\n\nApproximately 12 percent of women experience depression, compared to six percent of men. Doctors believe this is due to a combination of biological, psychological, and sociocultural factors. Fluctuating hormone levels play a role, as well as the fact that women are often more \"ruminative\" than men and experience more stress due to cultural expectations, like that they be able to balance a career, domestic obligations, and taking care of children and elderly relatives. And again, women are more likely to seek a diagnosis and treatment for depression \u2014 so there is a margin of error with these percentages.\n\nAs we open up to each other about our own mental health conditions, the more we'll learn about the illnesses and how others experience them \u2014 and it'll help continue to break down the stigma. A recurring theme among these illnesses is that, although women are often more vulnerable due to genetic and environmental factors, men are often hesitant to seek the help they need and deserve. So we should all be aware of the people around us and let them know that they're not alone if they're dealing with a mental health condition.\n\nImages: Pexels (1; 2; 3; 4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/173019-5-mental-illnesses-that-are-more-common-among-women", "summary": "This is unfortunate, because when we discuss our mental health issues, we find out things that make us feel less alone \u2014 like that fact that a number of mental disorders are most common among women.\nIn general, the consensus is that mental health issues are more common in women than men \u2014 especially certain disorders.\nThough recent research has shown that substance abuse is more common among men, and illnesses like ADHD and schizophrenia affect both genders equally, overall, women are 40 percent more likely than men to have mental health problems.\nAlthough income level appears to play a role in many mental illnesses, anxiety is not more common in any one income bracket \u2014 but it is more common in people under 35 and individuals with chronic physical illnesses.\nSpecific PhobiasPhobias are actually the most common mental disorder, but they often don't reach the point of interfering with a person's ability to function.", "timescraped": 1513838394.367881, "category": {"words": 1238, "personal": 14, "thirdperson": 20, "condition": 26, "recovery": 0}}, "ee42dbaa02bfe185ad618f5a899839a2": {"title": "3 Problems People From Toxic Families Often Struggle With", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost%2F2016%2F9%2F13%2Fa7589765-1fe6-43c4-8bf3-2ca68c5ac5bf.png?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "text": "So you've finally put some distance between yourself and your toxic family. Good for you! Whether you've stopped talking to your toxic parents entirely or just built some very sturdy emotional boundaries to protect yourself, you've taken an amazingly hard and amazingly important step toward building a happier, healthier life.\n\nI wish I could tell you that all the hard work is over. But as a fellow escapee from a dysfunctional family situation, I know that the legacy of your toxic family takes a little more time to shake \u2014 especially since you're probably dealing with some very real emotional or mental health challenges due to your upbringing.\n\nOf course, it's not a rule that all children raised in dysfunctional environments grow up to have emotional or mental health problems. Every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way, as they say, and you're the best judge of your own experience. But mental health professionals are in agreement that there is often psychological fallout from a difficult childhood. In fact, a 2014 Brazilian study confirmed that there are higher incidences of mental health problems in children from dysfunctional families. Sometimes, we can be so busy trying to push away the memory of our childhoods that we forget to look out for our own mental health.\n\nGoing into therapy to cope with your problems is often the most important first step for the adult child of a toxic family to move on \u2014 and doing it doesn't make you \"damaged goods\" or someone who is \"whining about your childhood.\" Check out the list below of three common problems that children from toxic households often have to deal with \u2014 and know that you're not alone if they sound familiar to you.\n\n1. Anxiety\n\nAnxiety is one of the most common mental health issues in the United States, so it certainly impacts plenty of people who had thoroughly idyllic upbringings. But children who grow in toxic homes often have an extremely intimate relationship with anxiety disorders \u2014 one 1998 study drew a connection between parents with generalized anxiety disorder and a dysfunctional home, and many mental health researchers find anxiety to be an extremely common problem among the adult children of dysfunctional homes.\n\nIn your toxic family, your parents may have made you unhealthily aware of their own anxieties (by doing things like refusing to let you do normal childhood activities based on an overblown fear of the consequences), or they might have even punished you for displaying early signs of anxiety disorder, which they may have derided as \"disobedience.\" As Susan Forward wrote in her classic book on the subject, Toxic Parents:\n\nChildren who are not encouraged to do, to try, to explore, to master, and to risk failure, often feel helpless and inadequate. Over-controlled by anxious, fearful parents, these children often become anxious and fearful themselves.\n\nToxic Parents, $14, Amazon\n\nAs a kid, I experienced it both ways \u2014 my mother's anxiety prevented her from permitting me to engage in normal childhood experiences like walking across my small suburban street by myself, and she mocked my own social anxiety was as something that made me pathetic.\n\nWhat can you do? When you're dealing with anxiety, no matter what the cause, getting professional help is essential. But when you anxiety was triggered or exacerbated by a toxic home situation, talk therapy can really help, especially cognitive behavioral therapy, which can help people unlearn negative thought patterns, and give them a greater sense of control in their lives.\n\n2. Trouble Interacting With Others\n\n[Embed]\n\nNo matter what their particular background, children from toxic families often have trouble letting other people get close to them, even after they've put space between themselves and their families. According to a 1989 psychological study of the adult children of alcoholics, \"Adults raised in dysfunctional families frequently report difficulties forming and maintaining intimate relationships, maintaining positive self-esteem, and trusting others; they fear a loss of control, and deny their feelings and reality.\"\n\nMaybe your parents raised you to believe that anyone outside the family was untrustworthy and looking for ways to hurt you. Maybe the way your parents hurt you made you have a hard time forging bonds with your peers. Maybe you kept friends at arms' length when you were growing up, because you were afraid of having them meet your parents or tell others about your dysfunctional home life \u2014 and now that you're an adult, you have no idea where to start when it comes to dating, making friends, or even just acting friendly at work.\n\nOr maybe you're feeling the opposite \u2014 your parents' approval was so unpredictable that you look for love everywhere, getting too close too fast with friends and lovers alike, in relationships that eventually crash and burn (right here, dude).\n\nAgain, from Forward's Toxic Parents:\n\nMost adult children of toxic parents grow up feeling tremendous confusion about what love means and how it\u2019s supposed to feel. Their parents did extremely unloving things to them in the name of love. They came to understand love as something chaotic, dramatic, confusing, and often painful \u2014 something they had to give up their own dreams and desires for. Obviously, that\u2019s not what love is all about. Loving behavior doesn\u2019t grind you down, keep you off balance, or create feelings of self-hatred. ... Genuine love creates feelings of warmth, pleasure, safety, stability, and inner peace.\n\nWhat can you do? Once again, therapy is always an amazing place to start. It can help you figure out what healthy boundaries are, and how to be less fearful of interacting with others.\n\nThere are also a lot of great self-help books out there dealing with these issues. Support groups for the children of dysfunctional adults, like Adult Children of Alcoholics, can also help people learn to connect with others in a controlled environment, where everyone understands what you've experienced. (If you're not able to go in person, online groups can help, too. Reddit's raisedbynarcissists is a great example of an online support group that can help you make sense of your experience and take tentative steps towards relating to others in an open way.)\n\n3. Difficulty Trusting Reality\n\nChildren from dysfunctional homes often notice early on that their experience of reality and their parents' experience of reality are very different \u2014 like, they might as well be on two different planets.\n\nMaybe your mother claimed your room was dirty when it clearly wasn't, and punished you for it anyway. Maybe your father remembers a birthday party that was marred by violent arguments as \"a wonderful day for the whole family.\" Maybe your parents went off on you for \"being promiscuous\" when you'd never even held anyone's hand. No matter how it presented itself, your parents' warped reality \u2014 usually accompanied by a discounting of your own reality and experiences \u2014 encouraged you not to trust not your own emotions, and possibly even your own sensory input.\n\nAccording to an informational report assembled by Texas Woman's University, \"In most dysfunctional families children tend to learn to doubt their own intuition and emotional reactions.\" The behavior described above is sometimes called \"gaslighting\" or \"reality shifting\" \u2014 a practice of either consciously trying to confuse someone about facts and reality in order to control them, or being so confused yourself about what is going on that you're a bad judge of reality, and so fearful and aggressive that you punish your children for contradicting you.\n\nMy own childhood was lousy with this sort of thing. My mother constantly questioned every element of my reality, from whether my boyfriends loved me to whether there was a \"regular\" cycle on our washing machine. It left me so mixed up and confused that to this day, I often don't trust my ability to gauge the emotions of others or my own memory of anything I've done in my daily life.\n\nWhat can you do? You guessed it! Therapy. As the same Texas Women's University report notes, \"Often outside support provides an objective perspective and much-needed affirmation which will help you learn to trust your own reactions.\"\n\nBut your outside support doesn't have to be limited to professionals. You can also ask close friends and partners who understand your situation to help you by providing positive feedback about your correct recall or reading of situations, or providing support when you question your own sense of reality. (I often recruit my boyfriend to confirm for me that I just had had a perfectly pleasant exchange with our landlord where no one was mad at me, etc.)\n\nI've also personally found journaling and list-making to provide a good anchor to reality. It helps me remember the things that have happened in any given day, and has strengthened by own ability to trust my own emotional responses, as well as my understanding of the emotional responses of others.\n\nThings might never become perfect for any of us. But things can get so much better if we just recognize the ways that we are hurt, and begin to let ourselves heal.\n\nImages: AMC; Giphy (3)", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/113750-3-problems-people-from-toxic-families-often-struggle-with", "summary": "So you've finally put some distance between yourself and your toxic family.\nIn fact, a 2014 Brazilian study confirmed that there are higher incidences of mental health problems in children from dysfunctional families.\nGoing into therapy to cope with your problems is often the most important first step for the adult child of a toxic family to move on \u2014 and doing it doesn't make you \"damaged goods\" or someone who is \"whining about your childhood.\"\nTrouble Interacting With Others[Embed]No matter what their particular background, children from toxic families often have trouble letting other people get close to them, even after they've put space between themselves and their families.\nAgain, from Forward's Toxic Parents:Most adult children of toxic parents grow up feeling tremendous confusion about what love means and how it\u2019s supposed to feel.", "timescraped": 1513838395.628884, "category": {"words": 1520, "personal": 20, "thirdperson": 25, "condition": 15, "recovery": 0}}, "937746f41121ccdda548ce6875b9e1fa": {"title": "'Crazy Ex-Girlfriend' Finally Diagnosed Rebecca, And Nailed The Reality Of Living With Mental Illness", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/uploads/image/2017/11/17/767ab13f-ddb4-4d34-9f44-3988253afe4d-ceg306a_0151b.jpg?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "text": "Spoilers ahead for Season 3 Episode 6 of Crazy Ex-Girlfriend.\n\nI have a confession to make: Just like Rebecca Bunch on Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, I have been desperately and not-so-patiently waiting to find out what her mental health diagnosis is. I thought that with that game-changing knowledge would come an immediate shift for her character, a sign that things would start to get better for her instantly... if only we could just find the right label to give her so she could begin the right treatment. It would be the magical fix for her spiral to rock bottom that culminated in her suicide attempt in the heart wrenching final scene of last week's episode. Because that's how it works in movies and on TV... right?\n\nWrong. As Rebecca learned recently, \"life is a series of gradual revelations that occur over a period of time\" and it \"doesn't make narrative sense\" (thanks, Josh Grobaaaaan!). Despite being a TV show, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend is determined to accurately depict mental illness, even if it creates a messier narrative. In tonight's incredibly moving follow-up chapter, \"Josh Is Irrelevant,\" both Rebecca and I finally faced some hard, honest facts. Even though the hour was centered on Rebecca finally receiving her diagnosis \u2014 a narrative beat that has been built up and teased for three years on The CW's groundbreaking musical drama \u2014 the situation is a lot more nuanced than that.\n\nThe CW\n\nWhen someone is living with a mental illness, it doesn't just magically go away once you find the right \"label\" for it. Living with a mental illness is just that: learning how to actually live with it and manage it as best as you can. It was extremely impressive how the episode touched on all the ways people tend to cope with mental health issues, both suffering from them or watching someone in your life suffer from them. First, obviously, was Rebecca's desperate need to find the right label for her mental health issues after receiving so many wrong diagnoses over the years that just didn't fit her. After her suicide attempt on her flight back to L.A., she ended up in the hospital surrounded by her friends (who of course forgave her for all the horrible things she said before she left town), and her new doctor diagnosed her with \u2014 drumroll please! \u2014 Borderline Personality Disorder.\n\nAfter her brilliantly optimistic anthem about finally getting the right diagnosis that would fix everything because she would finally fit in somewhere with others suffering from the same disease, Rebecca did exactly what her doctor told her not to do: she googled BPD. And she instantly hated everything she saw online.\n\nHer earlier hunger for a diagnosis became a desperate need to get a different, \"better\" one from a second source. It took Dr. Akopian to finally get Rebecca to see the truth: she does indeed have BPD, she can't trade it for something else, and she needs to listen to her doctor's advice and recommendations. Rebecca didn't like the stigma attached to having a personality disorder instead of something like depression or anxiety that she could be prescribed meds for. She didn't want to have to work at managing it for the rest of her life, because it actually required work. But that's the reality of living with mental illness: you can't pick and choose how your mind and body experience it, but you can't decide how you react to it.\n\nThe CW\n\nBy the end of the hour, Rebecca was newly motivated to follow her treatment plan and accepted her diagnosis, along with the knowledge that having that diagnosis wouldn't fix things for her; she had to work on fixing her life herself. She had hope and clarity of mind for the first time since, well, essentially since we first met her in the series premiere. Back then, she decided to drop everything to move to California to be with Josh, because she believed that she would be truly happy then for the first time in her life. And she finally learned in tonight's episode that, along with her diagnosis and coming to understand herself a little better, it was never really about Josh in the first place. And as Hector oh-so wisely puts it, \"Being suicidal has nothing to do with any one life event or person; it comes from a lifelong struggle with mental illness.\"\n\nDing ding ding! Rebecca's obsession with Josh and recent rejection and abandonment by him was never actually about Josh, though that didn't stop Josh from thinking it was (because of course). The whole episode, Josh tried to visit Rebecca in the hospital to try and apologize for making her want to kill herself (yeah, seriously). He even tried to bring her a puppy when she got home (and remember, this would be the first time he tried to initiate a face-to-face conversation with her since leaving her at the altar with no explanation).\n\nThis perfectly encapsulated the irrational egotism people can feel when someone they know and are close to tries to (or succeeds in) taking their own life. Blaming yourself for someone's suicide attempt is never the right thing, because mental illness and suicidal thoughts or actions are always about so much more than just one person. Josh finally realized this when he overheard Rebecca telling all her friends that she hadn't even thought about him in days. It's time for Josh to face the music and focus on his own issues ... but that's for another episode.\n\nThe CW\n\nAnother way that tonight's hour truly shined was in showing how all of Rebecca's friends reacted to her suicide attempt in authentic, yet incredibly different, ways. Valencia kept recording live video \"updates\" about Rebecca's recovery for her online \"fans,\" but only posted the highlights when she was actually having a really shitty (yes, literally shitty) time. Raise your hand if you actually give an accurate representation of your life on social media, including your lowest moments (no one's hand should be raised).\n\nPaula, meanwhile, coddled Rebecca and went along with every idea she had because she didn't know how else to help her friend. She's always been an enabler to Rebecca's wacky plans with her own, specific brand of mothering, but encouraging Rebecca to dismiss her doctor's diagnosis just because she didn't like how it sounded was not good motherly or friendly advice. Hopefully Dr. Akopian does get around to talking with Paula more, because there's definitely something deeper going on there.\n\nNathaniel (Scott Michael Foster) showcased how difficult it can be to reach out to someone going through a hard time because you don't know the right words to say. Watching him struggle to write a simple note to send with a bouquet of \"Get Well Soon\" flowers was all too real \u2014 I've lost count of how many times I tried to put pen to paper (or fingers to a keyboard) to send a message of condolences to family and friends, and my mind immediately went blank.\n\nThe CW\n\nBut it turns out there are no right words to say in that kind of situation; just the fact that you show someone you're thinking of them during a hard time is enough and what matters. And the side plot of his family revealing the truth about Nathaniel's mother's own suicide attempt when he was 10 was beautifully handled. It was a brilliant way to show the stigma that mental health issues and suicide still carry, especially in the upper class.\n\nIt's hardly a surprise that Crazy Ex-Girlfriend handled yet another story about mental illness with responsibility and authenticity (I don't use the word groundbreaking lightly), but the series continues to top itself with each new chapter in Rebecca's life. This episode serves as a refreshing eye-opener about the reality of living with mental illness, without ever getting stereotypical or cliche. There's no doubt in my mind that Rebecca's journey into treatment will be handled in an equally honest way, and I'm as cautiously optimistic as Rebecca is about the new path she's on.\n\nIf you or someone you know are experiencing suicidal thoughts, call 911, or call the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 1-800-273-8255.", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/p/crazy-ex-girlfriend-finally-diagnosed-rebecca-nailed-the-reality-of-living-with-mental-illness-5495597", "summary": "Despite being a TV show, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend is determined to accurately depict mental illness, even if it creates a messier narrative.\nThe CWWhen someone is living with a mental illness, it doesn't just magically go away once you find the right \"label\" for it.\nLiving with a mental illness is just that: learning how to actually live with it and manage it as best as you can.\nBut that's the reality of living with mental illness: you can't pick and choose how your mind and body experience it, but you can't decide how you react to it.\nThis episode serves as a refreshing eye-opener about the reality of living with mental illness, without ever getting stereotypical or cliche.", "timescraped": 1513838371.666186, "category": {"words": 1397, "personal": 8, "thirdperson": 72, "condition": 14, "recovery": 1}}, "9587d645bb98f79e90f60e32a6578f86": {"title": "6 Ways To Help Someone With An Eating Disorder Recover", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost/2016/9/13/2b251a98-4633-481f-8128-91edc5abe1d7.jpg?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "text": "A year ago, I had a traumatic experience that triggered a sharp turn in my emotional health. Eventually, this warped into a vicious battle with anorexia \u2014 and as anyone who suffers from an eating disorder knows, they come with a secret language, a bodily expression of internal pain that sometimes feels impossible to verbalize. Personally, I buried my shame and used punishing hunger to manifest my anger. As I did, the contours of my body sharpened, and I flattened into a flimsy shadow of my former, passionate self.\n\nMy eating disorder recovery has been a process of reading between the lines of my own self-destructive compulsions. My loved ones, after holding their tongues for a little too long, had to learn how to translate their worry into courageous compassion. Through tense trial-and-error, they\u2019ve discovered new ways of caring for me, and it's taught me how to stop, hear, and heal. Honestly, I have no doubt that I wouldn't be here without their vast, if imperfect, support. I'm also well aware that my illness hurt those I love almost as much as it hurt me, and that my recovery has been a process for us all.\n\nEating disorders thrive on isolation and shame. Few people recover on their own \u2014 it takes thoughtful, persistent, courageous intervention to help someone with an eating disorder return to a state of wellness. If you're close to someone who's struggling with an eating disorder, you may be in a position to save a life. Compassionate confrontation is often the first step to penetrating the all-consuming, truth-eclipsing cycle of disordered thinking.\n\nNo two people are alike, and no two eating disorders are exactly the same, either. How you help your friend with their eating disorder will largely depend on the level of intimacy and trust the two of you share. If you\u2019re close to the person, and know you have their respect, I invite you to consider the following six forms of support that I\u2019ve found to be key in my own recovery.\n\n1. Speak Up If You Feel Like Something's Not Right\n\nIf you suspect one of your loved ones is dealing with an eating disorder, say something. It won\u2019t come out perfectly, and you shouldn't gauge the success of your conversation by the response of your friend \u2014 chances are quite high that they'll be unreceptive, angry, or adamantly in denial. But it's also true that someone who is truly in the grips of an eating disorder has lost at least some ability to evaluate their condition objectively. It's very likely they're unaware of the toll their behavior is taking on their body, mind, and relationships.\n\nIt's important to remember that although eating disorders are miserable, most every person who struggles with one has believed, in some sense, that their disease is helping them. An eating disorder may be a way for your friend to contain the anxieties that riddle their mind. It may be a form of self-punishment, a manifestation of self-hatred they don\u2019t recognize. Know that your loved one may be caught in a cycle of futile comparison and perfectionism \u2014 their perceived control over their body and diet could be an attempt to conjure some feeling of accomplishment or self-approval.\n\nFor awhile, my family tried to intervene indirectly. They hesitantly offered food, asked me if I\u2019d lost weight, and made sad jokes about my melting curves. My friends murmured their concern to one another and watched me anxiously from a distance. Eventually, though, their concern boiled over into life-saving action. It was my best friend\u2019s unscripted tears, her loving, mumbling anger, and my family\u2019s firm embraces, that finally woke me.\n\n2. Listen To What They Have To Say, Even When It's Difficult To Hear\n\nYou must accept and respect your loved one's personal experience. It may not make sense to you that your friend, perhaps so obviously underweight, doesn\u2019t \u201cfeel thin,\u201d or that someone caught in a vicious cycle of binge-and-purge insists that they're \u201cin control.\u201d Even so, meet them where they're at. Approach them gently at first. Ask lots of questions. Let them tell you how they view the situation, and find out if they even believe there\u2019s cause for worry. You may not agree with their assessment, but it's important to listen anyway.\n\nLooking back, I\u2019m amazed at my loved ones\u2019 ability to listen to me so patiently. When I finally began to break my own silence, it took me time to decipher the knots of anxiety, regret, and fear that I was dealing with. I\u2019m sure I repeated myself, I\u2019m sure I talked nonsense half the time, and I know some of what I said was painful for them to hear. But they continued to reach out, gently, until I began to open up on my own. My trauma had locked me inside of myself, but my loved ones' compassionate, available ears slowly loosened isolation's steely grip.\n\n3. Encourage Them To Seek Professional Help \u2014 And Be Present Once They Do\n\nAs your friend begins to recognize the importance of recovery, encourage them to consider seeking professional help as part of their journey. Mental healthcare is still surrounded by an unfair stigma, but the value of psychological and medical attention in the eating disorder recovery process is crucial. If your friend expresses hesitation, listen to their concerns, and allow them to explore the reasons for their negative reaction.\n\nI, too, balked at the idea of involving mental health professionals in my recovery. It sounded excessive, inconvenient, and intimidating. Even so, as a long-time advocate for mental healthcare, I knew better. My chances of restoring my health would be far higher with a trained team behind me. I leaned on my family and friends for support. They frequently had to remind me that the appointments \u2014 doctors, nutritionist, therapist, repeat \u2014 were worth it. They held me accountable to my better judgement on the days when busyness or exhaustion drained me of my determination.\n\n4. Challenge Them To Take Their Recovery Seriously\n\nOnce your friend gets over the initial hurdle of recognizing their problem, it's important that they stay committed to consistent change over time. Under the care of professionals and loved ones, they should make it a goal to implement changes in their behavior, while also pursuing a healthier emotional and mental framework. A counselor once told me that the key to recovery is accepting discomfort \u2014 the strict parameters of an eating disorder must be challenged in order for a healthy pattern to take its place. This was crucial for me. It was so difficult to begin my \u201cturnaround\u201d that, afterwards, it was easy to overlook the importance of small, daily changes.\n\nI can't stress enough the importance of my healthcare team and loved ones. My doctors helped me understand the need to set goals for nutrition and physical recovery, while my friends and family encouraged me to practice a balanced routine of work, rest, and recreation. Looking back, I\u2019m amazed at their gentle patience. My nutritionist began by asking me to drink a cup of milk with my breakfast each day. That felt like a major imposition at the time, but five months and 15 pounds later, I see the wisdom in her gradual approach.\n\n5. Encourage Them To Have Fun & Laugh\n\nYour friend is not their disease. They may be captive to isolating compulsions, half-frozen by the effects of their anxieties, but your loved one is still a human being, an ecosystem of hope and passion as well as fear and uncertainty. It is possible that you could help them carry on living \u2014 recovery, after all, is a path back to life. Help your friend remember the way life used to be, and encourage them to engage again with what they once loved and enjoyed about it.\n\nFor me, the healing power of fun \u2014 the unadulterated silliness of dancing in the living room with siblings, the pleasure of a good book, the quiet thrill of beautiful music \u2014 revived my appetite for life and kept me motivated on the long trek back to health.\n\n6. Remind Them That You Value Their Life\n\nBear in mind that even the smallest step in this process may feel like a plunge for your friend. What we call \u201cobsessive\u201d is, often, a desperate attempt to externalize and control some very frightening feelings: helplessness, anxiety, depression. Suggesting to your friend that they should begin to give up the behaviors that have helped them cope may sound impossible to them at first.\n\nBut the beautiful fact is this: it is possible to get well. So many people do. I\u2019m doing it today. Right now, I'm at my laptop eating a peanut butter and banana sandwich (yum). It\u2019s a complex process, and the rewards are proportional to the courage and commitment I put into my recovery. It's not really about food (although I can\u2019t believe I forgot just how tasty mac\u2019n\u2019cheese can be). It\u2019s about so much more than poundage, or iron levels, or getting my doctors \u201coff my back\u201d by appeasing them with numbers.\n\nIt\u2019s about living \u2014 it\u2019s life, my life, at stake. I am learning to love living, to accept the reality of my body, my place and time in this world. Letting go of the numbing, destructive mechanism of my anorexia has left me facing the stark facts of my past abuse and present fears. It is much harder, and much braver, to deal with these things than to succumb to the soothing, strangling constraints of compulsive behavior. But in the pain and uncertainty of self-acceptance, of letting go, comes the freedom to live. And my loved ones help me realize that there is nothing more precious than being here.\n\nEditor's note: If you or a loved one is struggling with body image or an eating disorder, know that you\u2019re not alone, and help is available.\n\nImages: Sarah Aziza", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/137656-6-ways-to-help-someone-with-an-eating-disorder-recover", "summary": "My eating disorder recovery has been a process of reading between the lines of my own self-destructive compulsions.\nFew people recover on their own \u2014 it takes thoughtful, persistent, courageous intervention to help someone with an eating disorder return to a state of wellness.\nHow you help your friend with their eating disorder will largely depend on the level of intimacy and trust the two of you share.\nMental healthcare is still surrounded by an unfair stigma, but the value of psychological and medical attention in the eating disorder recovery process is crucial.\nAnd my loved ones help me realize that there is nothing more precious than being here.", "timescraped": 1513838373.382199, "category": {"words": 1654, "personal": 42, "thirdperson": 62, "condition": 4, "recovery": 6}}, "b7fdd1c23f2a64527fa0d1d429596543": {"title": "Can Anxiety Disorders Be Cured?", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost%2F2016%2F9%2F13%2F6ee2836f-1e7c-4084-8b79-807a3016d0a6.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "text": "Chances are strong that, if you have an anxiety disorder, whether it's obsessive-compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or something else, you'd do quite a lot to make it go away. Which is exactly why the idea of a permanent cure for anxiety is so tempting. If there is something that could take away your malfunctioning brain's difficulties forever, it's worth trying \u2014 right?\n\nWell, the notion of permanent recovery from an anxiety disorder is more complex than it sounds; some people, according to the American Psychological Association, \"are able to reduce or eliminate their anxiety symptoms and return to normal functioning after several months of appropriate psychotherapy\" (which is one of the big treatments for anxiety disorders), but that doesn't apply to everybody. Disordered anxiety is a complicated thing, and while you may be drawn to the magical cure advertised with such glamor on Twitter or a friend's Facebook, it may not offer exactly what it promises. So is a \"cure\" the right thing to be aiming for?\n\nScience hasn't yet developed a tool to delve into the brain and change the patterning of people suffering from anxiety disorders, though I'm sure the sign-up list would be pretty long if it did. Anti-anxiety medication can do some of the work, but it's not commonly regarded as a complete solution. Which means that, for desperate people with serious issues, the notion of a cure-all is incredibly tempting. Unfortunately, the likeliness that you'll live a life free of anxiety issues depends heavily on many things, and whether you click on that banner ad promising a miracle is not one of them.\n\nHere's what we know about anxiety disorders, the notion of the cure, and the difficulties of medicalizing mental issues.\n\nCan Anxiety Cures Ever Really Be Permanent?\n\nSurely if you try hard enough, work through enough therapy, and understand yourself sufficiently, you can defuse your anxiety permanently. Maybe you can use certain products or calming natural remedies to rid yourself of the entire issue. Right? Well, it's a tricky question, for various reasons. Anxiety disorders come in many forms, and can often be well-tackled with good therapy, medication, exercise and other treatments; but whether we can promise everybody a \"cure,\" a life entirely free of anxiety disorder symptoms, is another thing entirely.\n\n\n\nThe Anxiety And Depression Association Of America has an explicit warning on its website about the scam potential of anxiety \"cures\"; it's become enough of a problem that they've had to warn people away from false hope:\n\n\"Beware of extravagant claims \u2014 instant cures, guaranteed results of never again having anxiety symptoms, revolutionary formulas, \u201cnatural\u201d or unique methods or techniques that require payment... Just because it says \u201cscientifically proven\u201d doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s true.\"\n\n\n\nMany anxiety \"cures\" are targeted at the immediate: calming yourself down right now, using things like camomile tea, meditation, passionflower, or a bath. All of these are perfectly valid approaches; the Mayo Clinic lists a variety of herbal supplements whose scientific impact on anxiety levels requires more testing, but may produce possible anxiety-dampening effects. The problem with this should be evident: the nature of an anxiety disorder is often chronic and recurring, and focusing on the symptoms will likely not target the underlying issue.\n\nOther, longer-term therapeutic solutions may have more success. Exposure therapy for people with phobias, for instance, has been shown to help some people overcome their fears completely, while studies have shown that the practise of mindfulness (a kind of meditation) may have real therapeutic impact for anxiety sufferers. A 2013 study showed that mindfulness appears to reduce anxiety at a neural level, though the test wasn't done on people with anxiety disorders. But as for the silver bullet that kills anxiety dead in 100 percent of cases: well, we haven't found it yet. And we may never do so.\n\nWhy We Need A Little Bit Of Anxiety To Function\n\nAnxiety is actually not something to be completely dismissed from a healthy nervous system, which is why we can't just eliminate it completely and consider \"problem solved,\" except in the most extreme cases. The Cleveland Clinic calls it \"a natural response and a necessary warning adaptation in humans\"; in other words, we wouldn't have survived this long in human history without a dose of anxiety to keep us aware and on our toes. The fight-or-flight response associated with panic attacks is rooted in the body's adrenal system, which responds to threats by pumping blood and making us capable of taking on whatever threat is coming at us.\n\n\n\nAnxiety at a normal level is linked to high performance in stressful situations like exams: worrying about potential outcomes and being highly aware of your surroundings is a fairly good strategy in a high-pressure scenario. A little bit is not only a survival mechanism, it's also the brain's attempt to help you out. It's only when anxiety becomes overly-powerful and uncontrollable that it presents difficulties, so eliminating it altogether isn't really a solution in the first place.\n\nIs It Dangerous To Talk About Cures?\n\nThere's another issue to discuss here: whether thinking about anxiety, or any mental disorders, in terms of \"cure\" or \"recovery\" is actually helpful, or a misconception of the realities of mental problems.\n\n\n\nThe medicalization of mental health has, in many ways, been a good thing. It's helpful for people to comprehend mental health difficulties as, say, comparable to a broken leg when asking them to contemplate the real, physical obstacles of a serious brain issue. But there's a limit to the analogy, and that's the fact that mental health problems are extremely individual. Some may fade over time, others may go through phases of severity, and still others can be with the person for life. If they're going to be compared to anything physical, possibly mental health problems are most similar to a chronic pain condition, with highly individual details, a very unclear future, and a focus more on management than on \"cures\".\n\nThe other big problem with conceiving of all mental issues as \"curable\" or requiring \"recovery\" is that it creates a sense of failure. If you haven't \"gotten better,\" you're bad at having a mental illness and aren't trying hard enough. (This type of thinking will be particularly familiar to depressives, who can often include guilt at being depressed among their many self-castigating thoughts.) The range of mental illnesses is incredibly vast: from schizophrenia through bipolar disorder to anxiety and PTSD. And the reality is that, for those whose nervous systems create these particular conditions, the notion of a \"cure\" is sometimes not a valid one. Management may be very effective, therapy and lifestyle changes and bodily ageing and whatever else mean there's never a recurrence, and that's often as good as you can hope for.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nKeep this in mind when you're thinking about your own anxiety disorder and wanting to throw it out the window: that magical technique offered by a friend/Instagram/whatever may well have worked in specific instances, but it very likely can't be applied universally. Always check the research and discuss all possibilities with your GP and mental health professional before you embark on any new mental health regiment; and if you do strike it lucky and manage to live anxiety-free, don't go around preaching a cure to people who may be very different to you.\n\nImages: Pixabay; Giphy", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/159598-can-anxiety-disorders-be-cured", "summary": "Chances are strong that, if you have an anxiety disorder, whether it's obsessive-compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or something else, you'd do quite a lot to make it go away.\nWell, the notion of permanent recovery from an anxiety disorder is more complex than it sounds; some people, according to the American Psychological Association, \"are able to reduce or eliminate their anxiety symptoms and return to normal functioning after several months of appropriate psychotherapy\" (which is one of the big treatments for anxiety disorders), but that doesn't apply to everybody.\nScience hasn't yet developed a tool to delve into the brain and change the patterning of people suffering from anxiety disorders, though I'm sure the sign-up list would be pretty long if it did.\nHere's what we know about anxiety disorders, the notion of the cure, and the difficulties of medicalizing mental issues.\nA 2013 study showed that mindfulness appears to reduce anxiety at a neural level, though the test wasn't done on people with anxiety disorders.", "timescraped": 1513838374.685314, "category": {"words": 1241, "personal": 11, "thirdperson": 6, "condition": 43, "recovery": 2}}, "d43ca1545552baede8cbe56176dbd09a": {"title": "Online Support Groups For People With Mental Health Issues Are Super Important For Accessibility, & Here\u2019s Why", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/uploads/image/2017/12/7/1bf5c436-3ea1-41e7-a969-002421d4b1d9-stock_ab-0543.jpg?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "text": "As our society has become more tech-driven, health care options have made their way from IRL spaces into social media and apps. Online support groups for people with mental health issues and substance use disorders are becoming more widely available, and this is a big deal. Virtual support groups make mental health care more accessible, especially for people who are uncomfortable or unfamiliar with the traditional in-person support group model, or those who may be homebound due to disability.\n\n\u201cI believe peer support, personal or group, is instrumental in allowing individuals suffering from mental health or substance use disorders to re-integrate back into society. Peer support helps the individual in recognizing that their illness can be overcome due to experience sharing,\u201d Dr. Indra Cidambi, the Medical Director at Center for Network Therapy, tells Bustle. \u201cIn the event the individual is struggling, peer support can help through skill building, goal setting or mentoring. If these fail, peer support can connect them to resources that can help.\u201d\n\nIn August, the app Huddle was launched to provide people with mental health issues \u2014 from substance use disorder to body image issues \u2014 a social platform to receive and give support from peers struggling with the same issues. Tyler Faux, the co-founder of the app, told Business Insider, \u201cThe internet can actually be kind of a lonely place. I think there's an opportunity here to really help a lot of people who otherwise wouldn't have access to these kinds of conversations.\" Though the app is not intended to be a replacement for therapy, it allows people to anonymously or openly share Snapchat-like stories about their mental health struggles, successes, or advice.\n\nAnother app, called Nightlight: Social Meditation, connects users with meditation coaches and communities that foster a virtual, group meditation. Similarly to Huddle, Nightlight helps people connect and cope with mental health issues in a way they may have not had the ability or option to before. Mental illnesses boast the priciest health care costs in the United States, and this can have seriously detrimental effects on the ability or willingness to receive mental health treatment. According a 2017 report released by Mental Health America, around 6.3 million of American adults with mental illness remain uninsured, and 55 percent of American adults with mental illness who are insured reported not receiving any treatment in the past year. Additionally, the report revealed that 20 percent of people who did receive mental health treatment felt the services provided were inadequate, and did not meet their mental health care needs. This means free and readily available support for people with mental health issues is as important as ever before \u2014 whether those spaces are online or IRL.\n\nIntroducing Topics: a new feature just in time for #Thanksgiving!

They offer vital support which can often be received on demand, particularly in terms of online peer support groups,\u201d Dr. Dolores Cimini, the Director of the Middle Earth Peer Assistance Program at University of Albany, says. Sad Girls Club, an Instagram community that has over 20,000 thousand followers, provides mentally ill people with peer support, and posts with resources on how to cope with various issues. \u201c[People] spend a ton of time on the internet, it only makes sense to use online platforms to educate and uplift the mental health community,\u201d Elyse Fox, the founder of Sad Girls Club, tells Bustle. \u201cOnline platforms makes finding [mental health] resources easier.\u201d\n\nDespite the advantages of apps and online groups created for people struggling with mental health issues, professionals caution there are drawbacks to be aware of. \u201cWithin online peer support groups, as with any online communications, it is sometimes difficult to determine or understand the intent of a particular post or message, making it harder to respond to,\u201d Dr. Cimini explains to Bustle. She adds that another con of online spaces are potential \u201cliability issues, as the facilitator of an online peer support group may not always be able to control or verify the accuracy of information that is posted, or respond to very serious post in an efficient manner \u2014 such as those that may include threats of suicide.\u201d\n\nWhile Dr. Cidambi also expresses the benefits of having accessible mental health support through tech, she tells Bustle she prefers in-person peer support groups. \u201cReal life support is richer, in my opinion, because the individual knows they are talking to a real person who has gone through similar experiences. Real support groups also provide the opportunity to socialize and build a community around the individual suffering from addiction of mental health issues.\u201d\n\nOverall, mental health apps are a great tool that can and should be utilized. However, for people struggling with chronic mental health issues, it is important to have additional therapeutic resources. Whether through individual therapy, in-person support groups, or an app, continuing to build a bigger and better support system is key to recovery.", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/p/online-support-groups-for-people-with-mental-health-issues-are-super-important-for-accessibility-heres-why-7211912", "summary": "Online support groups for people with mental health issues and substance use disorders are becoming more widely available, and this is a big deal.\nAdditionally, the report revealed that 20 percent of people who did receive mental health treatment felt the services provided were inadequate, and did not meet their mental health care needs.\n\u201cPeer support groups offer people a sense that they are not alone in their struggles.\n\u201cOnline platforms makes finding [mental health] resources easier.\u201dDespite the advantages of apps and online groups created for people struggling with mental health issues, professionals caution there are drawbacks to be aware of.\nHowever, for people struggling with chronic mental health issues, it is important to have additional therapeutic resources.", "timescraped": 1513838377.0729349, "category": {"words": 884, "personal": 2, "thirdperson": 13, "condition": 21, "recovery": 0}}, "bff6b8ca9e2ecc238b9e3b30c953a1d9": {"title": "How To Tell If Your Depression Is Actually Bipolar II Disorder", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/2017/5/3/6e5dbd69-cea8-4bed-8e68-ee6174a36cff.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "text": "Many mental health disorders are widely misunderstood, with incorrect or unclear symptoms attributed to them in the public imagination \u2014 and bipolar disorders are no exception.

Read on to find out more about why bipolar II disorder is frequently misdiagnosed as unipolar depression \u2014 and how to know if that kind of misdiagnosis may have happened to you.\n\nWhy Bipolar II Disorder Is So Often Misdiagnosed As Depression The Balance Between Light And Dark: What Bipolar II Disorder Feels Like https://t.co/rQfUai087q \u2014 a\u2113\u2113\u03afe (@AllieBatey) May 3, 2017 First off, technically, people who suffer from bipolar disorders do struggle with a form of depression \u2014 or, at least, depressive episodes. People with bipolar disorder, across both types, experience similar periodic levels of low mood. But the specifics of how low mood plays out in bipolar II sufferers is what can get the disorder mistaken for unipolar depression; while people with bipolar II disorder typically experience more subdued manic episodes than people with bipolar I disorder, their depressive episodes tend to be relatively severe. These periods of low mood often create misdiagnoses because of their comparative severity. While bipolar I disorder sufferers experience periods of depression and mania, bipolar II sufferers experience \"hypomania\" instead. We'll go more in depth into the differences between manic and hypomanic states below, but the major difference is one of degree. In other words, due to their lack of severity in comparison with manic states, hypomanic states may not necessarily raise any alarm bells \u2014 especially when compared with the severity of a bipolar II sufferer's depressive episodes. The possible result? An incorrect diagnosis of depression. This is a problem, for one very worrying reason. Many people diagnosed with plain depression are given antidepressants; but increasing scientific evidence shows that, for those with bipolar I or II disorder, antidepressants without any additional medication may actually trigger manic episodes. In a 2013 study published by the Psychiatric Times, 100,000 subjects being treated with medication specifically for major depressive disorder were followed over 2.4 years; 8.2 percent of them demonstrated \"mood-switching,\" and the \"[c]umulative risk of mood switching increased up to 24 months of antidepressant treatment.\" It's now widely accepted that, in people who have unrecognized bipolar disorders, antidepressants, specifically SSRIs, can increase manic episodes. (There's some evidence that this occasionally happens in people dealing only with depression as well, but scientists have yet to figure out exactly why.)\n\nHow Is Hypomania Different From Mania? In 2011 actress Catherine Zeta-Jones, 41, revealed that she has bipolar II disorder, which causes severe depression. pic.twitter.com/nP4WxGZqwJ \u2014 AchieveTMS.East (@AchieveTMS_east) April 28, 2017 Depictions of bipolar disorders in the media (for instance, in the worldwide hit Norwegian TV show SKAM, in which a character's new boyfriend has a manic episode and ends up getting arrested), tend to focus on bipolar I. However, the lack of widespread coverage of bipolar II and hypomania symptoms means that they can slip under the radar. What symptoms differentiate manic and hypomanic states? Mania, the National Institute of Mental Health explains, can involve a huge catalogue of symptoms. People experiencing a manic state may: \"feel very \u201cup,\u201d \u201chigh,\u201d or elated; have a lot of energy; have increased activity levels; feel \u201cjumpy\u201d or \u201cwired;\u201d have trouble sleeping; become more active than usual; talk really fast about a lot of different things; be agitated, irritable, or \u201ctouchy;\u201d feel like their thoughts are going very fast; think they can do a lot of things at once; do risky things, like spend a lot of money or have reckless sex...\" Hypomania, by contrast, is a milder form. One of the distinctions is duration \u2014 mania lasts up to 7 days, hypomania only a few days \u2014 but mania is also distinguished from hypomania by certain other severe symptoms. While people going through a hypomanic state may also experience rapid thoughts, heightened confidence, euphoria, restlessness and risk-taking, a difference, as the mental health charity Mind explains, is that people going through a manic state experience it in much more extreme form. Individuals experiencing a manic state may believe that they're invincible or \"special,\" may be completely unable to focus on one thing at once, and may also experience psychosis, delusions, paranoia, a lack of ability to communicate clearly, and/or a tendency to engage in uncontrolled or disastrous actions. \"What really differentiates the two episodes or states from each other,\" notes the specialist bipolar treatment clinic Bipolar Lab, \"is the severity, duration, and from a psychological point of view the experience of each patient. The DSM-IV sets four days as the minimum duration for a hypomanic episode and states that the mood has to be 'clearly different from the usual non-depressed mood'.\" But, it adds, \"the two most important criteria... that refer to functional impairment essentially summarize the major difference between a hypomanic and a manic episode. The hypomanic episode is associated with an 'unequivocal change in functioning that is uncharacteristic of the person when not symptomatic'... and the episode is not severe enough to cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning, or to necessitate hospitalization, and there are no psychotic features.\" In other words, people experiencing hypomanic states don't necessarily act completely different when they're experiencing an episode, can keep functioning relatively normally, and generally do not engage in behavior that leads to emergency crisis treatment.", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/p/how-to-tell-if-your-depression-is-actually-bipolar-ii-disorder-55322", "summary": "Why Bipolar II Disorder Is So Often Misdiagnosed As Depression The Balance Between Light And Dark: What Bipolar II Disorder Feels Like https://t.co/rQfUai087q \u2014 a\u2113\u2113\u03afe (@AllieBatey) May 3, 2017 First off, technically, people who suffer from bipolar disorders do struggle with a form of depression \u2014 or, at least, depressive episodes.\nBut the specifics of how low mood plays out in bipolar II sufferers is what can get the disorder mistaken for unipolar depression; while people with bipolar II disorder typically experience more subdued manic episodes than people with bipolar I disorder, their depressive episodes tend to be relatively severe.\nWhile bipolar I disorder sufferers experience periods of depression and mania, bipolar II sufferers experience \"hypomania\" instead.\nIn 2011 actress Catherine Zeta-Jones, 41, revealed that she has bipolar II disorder, which causes severe depression.\nHowever, the lack of widespread coverage of bipolar II and hypomania symptoms means that they can slip under the radar.", "timescraped": 1513838379.49046, "category": {"words": 1076, "personal": 6, "thirdperson": 11, "condition": 11, "recovery": 2}}, "2044c1c321da345a45f71fb657486892": {"title": "Wear Your Label Fashion Entrepreneurs Describe How They're Reducing The Stigma Of Mental Illness Through Stylish Visibility", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost%2F2016%2F9%2F13%2F17cd4546-15b9-42b2-960f-9c9692bf3a3d.png?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "text": "Wear Your Label is a Canadian \"conscious clothing line with the goal to create conversations around mental health.\" I discovered the brand while browsing an Etsy-like website called Colabination. Due to my devastating personal experiences with depression, I was touched to see apparel printed with encouraging messages such as \"your story isn't over\" and \"it's okay to not be okay.\" I also really respect that Wear Your Label decided to remove gender designations from their online store. Furthermore \u2014 yes, there's more! \u2014 they pledged to never Photoshop their models. Wear Your Label insists, \"No skin retouching [or] slimming effects... We believe in perfect imperfection, raw emotion, and brand transparency.\" Amen to that!\n\nThe co-founders of Wear Your Label connected with me on Twitter, and we decided to have a conversation that delved deeper. Kayley Reed and Kyle MacNevin, respectively 21 and 22, are the passionate people behind this project. It's personal for them, like it is for me: MacNevin suffers from generalized anxiety disorder and Reed is in recovery from anorexia nervosa. So without any further ado, here is my conversation with them \u2014 where you can discover Wear Your Label's birth story and delve into the intersection between fashion and mental health.\n\nHow did you meet and get to know each other?\n\nReed: I was volunteering with a mental health group as part of a student co-op program for my undergrad degree. Kyle had been working with the same organization for a while as a youth consultant, and I got paired with him as my mentor. Later, I found out he secretly traded with someone else to have me on his team for the project! Haha.\n\nMacNevin: Kayley is absolutely right! I did trade for her, and I am so glad that I did. Sometimes, you recognize great potential in someone even when you first meet.\n\nClearly the stigma of mental illness sucks, and it has affected you enough that you're willing to work really hard to change the way society looks at people who struggle emotionally. When and how did you decide that this was something you wanted to combat?\n\nReed: There were a few different instances when I realized this was something I had to do. One was just meeting and working with Kyle. He was one of the first people I ever felt comfortable sharing my story with, because he was open about his. Conversations always inspire me, and really sparked Wear Your Label. Another was facilitating at the Jack Summit, Canada's only student-led mental health innovation summit. Meeting 200 others from across the country, all determined to end the stigma, was a pretty motivating experience that helped me realize that Wear Your Label could really mean something.\n\nMacNevin: I don't think there was ever an \"aha!\" moment for me. I grew up not really understanding the negative impacts that anxiety and ADHD had on me. Meeting Kayley, and being able to feel comfortable enough to share with her really made me think. These issues are invisible. I never would have expected that Kayley was someone affected by mental illness, at face value. So... mental illness is not like a broken arm or leg where you can see a cast. Mental illness needs to be visible, it needs a cast, or a vivid description that tells the world, \"I'm hurt, but don't worry; I'm getting better.\" I think largely that's what we are trying to do with our clothing.\n\nWhy did you decide to collaborate on Wear Your Label?\n\nReed: It happened really organically. Our project for the organization was to create a way to engage youth on mental health issues. We both love fashion, and came up with Wear Your Label over a dinner conversation (after the project had passed). We had already clicked personally and professionally, and were too passionate to NOT start Wear Your Label after we'd started thinking about it.\n\nMacNevin: Wear Your Label didn't happen over night; it took time. As do all ideas that eventually grow into ventures. Ours was moulded by a few strong driving forces: Our personal experience, our interest in fashion, and background in leadership and engagement activities.\n\nDo you remember any specific personal experiences with mental health stigma that affected you?\n\nReed: Growing up, I was always the \"skinny\" friend. I'd hear comments about my weight, how lucky I was, how my other friends were envious that I was so small. I never thought it affected me or was a big deal, until my eating disorder became severe enough that I was seeing doctors three times a week. Then, the more I heard these things from those around me, the less I wanted to work on recovery. I was scared that if I put on weight, I would no longer be the \"skinny\" friend \u2014 so what would I be? I felt like I'd lose my identity.\n\nEventually, I realized my health was more important \u2014 and now that I'm at a healthy weight, my friends actually tell me I look so much better, happier, healthier. But I think people just don't realize how harmful what they're saying can be. I was literally dying, and people were telling me how they wished they were my size. To be fair, no one knew I had an eating disorder. I was very secretive about it until just a few months ago. But our society is programmed to think that smaller is better, and after experiencing the other side, it can be so, so harmful to assume certain things and talk about beauty in a one-dimensional way.\n\nMacNevin: I still get stigmatized for having mental illness... especially in business. My relationships with suppliers and other manufacturers can become very exhausting. Because we are \"do-gooders\" and have mental illness, they think they can take advantage of that and delay shipments or add surcharges and we won't react. I can be kind of a jerk when it comes to our supply-chain management, and logistics. That being said, often the case is that people assume mental illness is weakness, which is simply not true.\n\nWhy did you pick fashion as your area of activism? And why actually making clothes as opposed to just, say, blogging? (I ask because it seems like a ton of work and I'm impressed.)\n\nReed: Haha, thank you! It is a lot of work. I don't think we realized how much work, to be honest. We both just LOVE fashion \u2014 I'm also a writer for a few fashion blogs and magazines. We had the edge of being so naive about the industry and starting a fashion line that we didn't know how hard it would be. We kind of just jumped into it and learned as we went.\n\nMacNevin: Like I said earlier, mental illness needs to be visible. It needs to be in classrooms, in business meetings, on first dates, at the movies, or your friend's birthday party. It needs to have its own symbol like a sling or a cast that explains to the world that you're sick but are getting better.\n\nHow would you each describe your personal sense of style?\n\nReed: It changes a lot based on my lifestyle and what I'm into at the moment. Like, I just graduated from university in the spring and am kind of at that Millennial dream \"discovering myself\" stage. I'm loving (slightly sassy) statement shirts that talk about that lifestyle, paired with leggings and big sweaters. Also, I've been binge-watching Friends this month and am so into Rachel's 1990s style (oversized plaid shirts, high-waisted jeans, crop tops).\n\nMacNevin: I get a lot of my influences from television and film. Some days, I want to look like James Bond in a fitted three-piece suit, Oxfords, and a tie. For other occasions I will wear joggers, crewneck sweaters, and Nikes. I often get very anxious about what I'm wearing, and it affects my decision-making, and the risks I take. I typically overdress for most occasions, even screen-printing at work.\n\nWhat does the future of Wear Your Label look like, ideally?\n\nReed: That's a big question. We have so many plans and ideas. But my little vision for the future, is just two strangers walking down the street and seeing each other wearing something with the Wear Your Label logo \u2014 and automatically having that silent connection, knowing that another person understands what they're going through, and supports this movement of positive mental health. I think that's what it's all about \u2014 just helping others understand that they're not alone, and it's okay to talk about whatever mental health challenge you may be facing.\n\nMacNevin: That is a tricky question. I would eventually like to see Wear Your Label go out of business because we have eradicated stigma. But I understand that changing people's perceptions doesn't happen quickly. I would really like to see us grow into more intricate designs, with woven fabric, and higher couture pieces that can be worn during special occasions. I also see real potential for Wear Your Label to grow into new markets that help reduce stigma about other social issues. For 2015 we are exploring what it means to be in retail and how that impacts our brand.\n\nStay tuned!\n\nImages: Wear Your Label; Flickr/daniellehelm/Laura Lewis; Giphy", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/67260-wear-your-label-fashion-entrepreneurs-describe-how-theyre-reducing-the-stigma-of-mental-illness-through-stylish", "summary": "Wear Your Label is a Canadian \"conscious clothing line with the goal to create conversations around mental health.\"\nReed: I was volunteering with a mental health group as part of a student co-op program for my undergrad degree.\nSo... mental illness is not like a broken arm or leg where you can see a cast.\nThat being said, often the case is that people assume mental illness is weakness, which is simply not true.\nWe both just LOVE fashion \u2014 I'm also a writer for a few fashion blogs and magazines.", "timescraped": 1513838381.80097, "category": {"words": 1559, "personal": 93, "thirdperson": 16, "condition": 19, "recovery": 1}}, "2fcf868469235545d04fcd2b15aa5317": {"title": "'Lady Dynamite' Star Maria Bamford's Plan: Depict Mental Illness, Save The World", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/uploads/image/2017/11/27/513b5c53-1b69-4416-89aa-44177e690561-ld_202_00783r.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "text": "In the first season of the comedian Maria Bamford\u2019s semi-autobiographical comedy Lady Dynamite, there\u2019s one moment where I felt a deep pang of recognition. After a chance encounter with the handsome Graham (played by Dean Cain, no less) at her own open house, our hero Maria begins dating him. The problem? His credit score isn\u2019t approved to purchase her home, and since they\u2019re newly dating, she makes the ill-advised decision to ask him to move in with her. \u201cGod, you\u2019re so strong,\u201d Graham says admiringly after he accepts her generosity. Cut to Maria, huddled over in the shower, screaming into a sponge.\n\nLady Dynamite features Bamford playing a fictionalized version of herself, so not all of that scene is a true story. But it\u2019s a scene that perfectly encapsulates the show\u2019s depiction of the ways one can crumble under the stress of mental illness. \u201cI'm not a very screamer-type person, but when I was feeling so bad during that time, I had a couple episodes where it's like I had to scream. So I'd scream into a pillow or something,\u201d Bamford says, referencing her own struggles with Bipolar II Disorder. However, as funny as the running screaming gag was, it\u2019s not something you\u2019ll see in the newly released season two, now available on Netflix, because the character \u2014 like Bamford in real life \u2014 is \u201cpresumably well medicated.\u201d\n\nNetflix\n\nThe show\u2019s skillful blurring of the lines between Bamford\u2019s real life and her life as created by a writers room, coupled with its nuanced depiction of mental illness, is what makes Lady Dynamite one of the most interesting and inventive shows currently airing on television. It\u2019s a hilarious, surreal portrait of a woman trying to recover \u2014 complete with shifting timelines, L.A. comedy scene in-jokes, and all the talking pugs you could need \u2014 and one that so closely resembles Bamford\u2019s life and mental breakdown yet doesn\u2019t all at the same time.\n\nA long beloved stand-up comedian, Bamford has never shied away from honestly talking about her lifelong mental health issues. But in 2011, when things were going well for her professionally, the death of her dog Blossom caused things to fall apart. In a span of 18 months, she did three different stints in the psych ward to keep herself from committing suicide. She was eventually diagnosed with Bipolar II.\n\nSeason One of Lady Dynamite, which premiered in May 2016 on Netflix, touches on Bamford\u2019s institutionalization, but doing so wasn\u2019t necessarily cathartic for the comedian. \u201cIt's still so funny that doing a show about a mental breakdown [...] is probably the fastest way you can get to a mental breakdown,\u201d Bamford says. Still, for a comedian who mentions she \u201cdefinitely, on some level, prefers playing a character,\u201d fictionalizing her life has helped Bamford tell stories that can feel universal while being intensely personal. While she\u2019s involved a bit in the writers room, giving them ideas for jokes and telling them things about her life all while eating a salad \u2014 Bamford is not a full-blown writer for the show, and that\u2019s what she prefers.\n\n\u201cIt isn't totally me, and that's OK,\u201d she says of Maria on Lady Dynamite. \u201cI can be a part of a group effort to make a delightful story and it doesn't have to be exactly me, although they do a great job of getting my voice and my point of view across, which is lovely. Also I just don't have the energy to do it,\u201d she admits.\n\nComedy Central on YouTube\n\nWhile Lady Dynamite certainly has more than its fair share of heavy storylines, as we see in its depictions of Maria\u2019s breakdown, hospitalization, and recovery, one of the funniest things that balances out the heaviness is Bamford\u2019s affinity towards animals. That includes both the pugs that she owns (Burt and Blueberry, RIP Blossom) who constantly give her advice, to a cavalcade of other animals who cross her path, like raccoons and goats, who are also seemingly therapeutic in both her real and fictional lives.\n\nLike a true animal lover, once we bring up the topic of animals, Bamford\u2019s mind instantly wanders to musing about how her furry friends are cared for on set. \u201cThe guinea pig is given so much respect,\u201d Bamford says, going on to mimic a dutiful animal handler. \u201c\u2018Oh, the guinea pig needs to sit down. Close the cage so he doesn't have to see anything and get anxious or triggered.\u2019\" One of the things that\u2019s obvious talking with Bamford is her seemingly endless compassion for everything and everyone. After discussing the high-class treatment of the animals on the Lady Dynamite set, she begins worrying about the extras.\n\n\u201cThe poor extras are there 17 hours, dehydrated in a dark hallway. I feel terrible,\u201d she laments. Bamford\u2019s own experience as an extra makes her familiar with the struggle, and she\u2019s especially sympathetic given her husband\u2019s hectic experience as an extra on the set of Lady Dynamite. \u201cIt just is heartbreaking to me,\u201d she says. \u201cI'm not sure how to fix it.\u201d\n\nNetflix\n\nEven if she doesn\u2019t have the answers just yet, knowing the passion that Bamford has put into her work destigmatizing mental illness, it\u2019s easy to imagine her leading hordes of extras into unionizing. Hell, it\u2019s easy to see Bamford, in all her \u201chigh, squeaky, insecure\u201d voiced glory, saving the goddamn world. And for many, Bamford already has.\n\nWith Season One of Lady Dynamite, Bamford gave voice to so many with her fictionalized depiction of her mental breakdown and subsequent bipolar diagnosis. She mentions that she\u2019s received so much support (but not so much that it\u2019s overwhelming) for the show's depiction of mental illness. It\u2019s been just enough, she says, that she\u2019s gotten some free bottles of water. \u201cIt's really been very heartening and helps me feel sort of useful,\u201d Bamford says. \u201cPeople have said that it's helped them feel less alone, and that's really wonderful and helps me feel less alone because all the other people are coming up to me. It's wonderful.\u201d\n\nNetflix on YouTube\n\nWhile Bamford might not acknowledge it, her comedy and work on Lady Dynamite is helping change the world, one person at a time. So what would be next in Maria Bamford\u2019s hierarchy of things to change in the world? \u201cExtras, number one. Well, things that I might have any access to,\u201d she suggests. Her brilliant, hilarious brain can already see how to address the work conditions for extras on Lady Dynamite: \u201cOh my gosh,\u201d she adds. \u201cIf there is a third season, one of the episodes will be the extras rising up and taking over the show.\u201d As long as an uprising doesn't cause Maria to return to screaming into sponges, we'll consider it a success.", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/p/lady-dynamite-star-maria-bamfords-plan-depict-mental-illness-save-the-world-6092427", "summary": "In the first season of the comedian Maria Bamford\u2019s semi-autobiographical comedy Lady Dynamite, there\u2019s one moment where I felt a deep pang of recognition.\nLady Dynamite features Bamford playing a fictionalized version of herself, so not all of that scene is a true story.\nWith Season One of Lady Dynamite, Bamford gave voice to so many with her fictionalized depiction of her mental breakdown and subsequent bipolar diagnosis.\nSo what would be next in Maria Bamford\u2019s hierarchy of things to change in the world?\nHer brilliant, hilarious brain can already see how to address the work conditions for extras on Lady Dynamite: \u201cOh my gosh,\u201d she adds.", "timescraped": 1513838383.151273, "category": {"words": 1123, "personal": 14, "thirdperson": 47, "condition": 10, "recovery": 1}}, "c4cf333abbe985536294d6c8de94c431": {"title": "17 Nonfiction Books That Need To Be On Every Woman's Bucket List", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost/2016/9/13/c42b181e-8652-4f7c-9dbe-73e3b461cbcd.jpg?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "text": "I first fell in love with nonfiction in college when I took a feminist-focused creative nonfiction writing class.

In an interview with The Telegraph's Bryony Gordon for her podcast, Mad World, the prince told Gordon of the serious effect his mother's death had on his mental well-being and how the scrutiny of the public eye compounded these feelings. While for a long time he pushed these issues aside, he has put himself in a better place with the help of mental health counselors and therapeutic boxing. By telling his story, he hopes others will be inspired to seek the care they need, and that's not the only action he's taking to make a change.\n\nGordon's Mad World podcast features interviews with high-profile guests about their mental health experiences. It provided a platform for Prince Harry to open up about some trying times in his life and how these periods impacted his mental health. While members of the royal family have started speaking out about mental health awareness in recent years, Harry's interview is significant in that he spoke about his personal experience. When his mother, Princess Diana, passed away, he was only 12 years old, and in the interview, he described spending most of his youth trying put his mother and the accident out of mind.\n\n\u201cI can safely say that losing my mum at the age of 12, and therefore shutting down all of my emotions for the last 20 years, has had a quite serious effect on not only my personal life but my work as well,\u201d the prince said. \"I have probably been very close to a complete breakdown on numerous occasions when all sorts of grief and sort of lies and misconceptions and everything are coming to you from every angle.\u201d\n\nGetty Images/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nLuckily, he realized it was important to confront his past and address his mental state. These days, he's doing well, and therapy and exercise have played a big role. When asked about seeing a professional, his answer was encouraging. \u201cI\u2019ve done that a couple of times, more than a couple of times,\" he said. \"but it\u2019s great.\u201d\n\nThe candid interview is part of a bigger movement on the part of the royal family to break the social stigma around mental health. Prince Harry, along with his brother, Prince William, and Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, have started Heads Together, a charity that promotes mental health awareness and wellbeing. On the organization's website, the cause is described:\n\nHeads Together aims to change the national conversation on mental health and wellbeing, and is a partnership with inspiring charities with decades of experience in tackling stigma, raising awareness, and providing vital help for people with mental health challenges.\n\nHarry was inspired to put a focus on mental health during his time in Afghanistan, where he worked in a personnel recovery unit. There, he heard the stories of injured servicemen and women on mental health issues, and their openness changed his perspective. \"I know there is huge merit in talking about your issues and the only thing about keeping it quiet is that it\u2019s only ever going to make it worse,\u201d he said. When he neared the end of his 20s and started to sense he might need help, his time in Afghanistan helped him realize it was OK to have an open conversation and lean on others.\n\nOften, starting the conversation is the most difficult hurdle in tackling mental health. Heads Together is a way for the prince to show his gratitude to those who helped in his recovery, and to make it easier for others who may be struggling to come out and seek help.\n\n\u201cBecause of the process I have been through over the past two and a half years, I've now been able to take my work seriously, been able to take my private life seriously as well,\" he said, explaining why he chose to share a personal story. \"And been able to put blood, sweat and tears into the things that really make a difference and things that I think will make a difference to everybody else.\u201d\n\nWPA Pool/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nIt took guts for the royal to be this open, but his struggle is sure to resonate with listeners and royal family followers. While they haven't shared personal stories like Harry, Kate Middleton and Prince William are equally passionate advocates of mental health awareness: Middleton became a spokesperson for child mental health care, bringing the issue into the public's eye; Prince William delivered a powerful speech to the Guild of Health Writers in February to warn against the taboo on mental health.\n\nThe Heads Together charity partners with many other groups which promote mental health awareness and wellness, and together these groups are doing important work to break the stigma. From the personal resonance of the Prince Harry's story to the empowering speeches from Middleton and Prince William, the royal family is doing their part to change mental health policy and perception for the better.", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/p/prince-harry-opening-up-about-his-mental-health-is-part-of-a-bigger-royal-movement-51654", "summary": "In an unprecedented conversation for the royal family, Prince Harry opened up about his mental health struggles to help break the stigma attached to discussing these issues.\nPrince Harry, along with his brother, Prince William, and Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, have started Heads Together, a charity that promotes mental health awareness and wellbeing.\nHarry was inspired to put a focus on mental health during his time in Afghanistan, where he worked in a personnel recovery unit.\nThere, he heard the stories of injured servicemen and women on mental health issues, and their openness changed his perspective.\nWhile they haven't shared personal stories like Harry, Kate Middleton and Prince William are equally passionate advocates of mental health awareness: Middleton became a spokesperson for child mental health care, bringing the issue into the public's eye; Prince William delivered a powerful speech to the Guild of Health Writers in February to warn against the taboo on mental health.", "timescraped": 1513838361.20513, "category": {"words": 847, "personal": 3, "thirdperson": 44, "condition": 19, "recovery": 1}}, "826a001733094281bba88da69835eff0": {"title": "What Is World Mental Health Day? 5 Ways To Show Your Support This Year", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/uploads/getty/2017/10/9/b1173eed-e20e-43d1-bb98-e80b78e46f93-getty-593252908.jpg?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "text": "Increasingly, research has shown that mental health plays a key role in a person's overall health and wellbeing. While achieving this delicate balance is a daily struggle for millions of people, one day each year is devoted to mental health. What is World Mental Health Day? Oct. 10 is dedicated annually to raising awareness about mental health issues around the world and to mobilize efforts in support of mental health, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nIf you struggle with mental illness, then you know how important it is to shine a spotlight on this issue. If you don't, you likely know someone who does, and there are myriad ways to show your support. While the body and mind are often treated separately, these two systems actually inform overall wellness. \"Health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social wellbeing and is not merely the absence of disease or infirmity,\" Benjamin F. Miller and Tyler Norris wrote on the Health Affairs Blog.\n\nBecause mental health informs every area of your life, the theme for World Mental Health Day 2017 is mental health in the workplace. \"Depression and anxiety disorders are common mental disorders that have an impact on our ability to work, and to work productively,\" the WHO noted. \"Globally, more than 300 million people suffer from depression, the leading cause of disability. More than 260 million are living with anxiety disorders. Many of these people live with both. A recent WHO-led study estimates that depression and anxiety disorders cost the global economy US$ 1 trillion each year in lost productivity.\"\n\nBecause adults spent a lot of time at work, addressing mental health at work is an important part of advancing the mental health conversation. Here are some ways you can support World Mental Health Day 2017 at work, and everywhere else.\n\n1. Educate Yourself About Mental Health\n\nIf you don't struggle with mental illness, you might not know that there are big differences between being depressed and feeling sad, having anxiety and being nervous, or feeling jumpy and suffering from PTSD. Contrary to some outdated beliefs, a person suffering from mental illness is not able to will themselves to be well, though as someone who has suffered from depression my entire life I can fake being well because sometimes I have to.\n\nResearch has shown that, like the late Carrie Fisher said, depression is a disease of the brain. And, the main subcortical limbic brain regions implicated in depression are the amygdala, hippocampus, and the dorsomedial thalamus, according to research by Mayur Pandya, Murat Altinay, Donald A. MaloneJr., and Amit Anand published in Current Psychiatry Reports. \"Both structural and functional abnormalities in these areas have been found in depression,\" the authors wrote.\n\nThe more you know about what mental illness is and isn't, the better you will be able to understand family and friends who might be battling mental illness. If you really want to commit to learning more, you can even take a class in mental health first aid class.\n\n2. Advocate For Workplace Wellness Programs\n\nSince you likely spend 40 hours a week or more at work, having a comprehensive wellness program in the workplace is important to your health and wellness. I actually didn't really know this until I worked for a company that had one. Aside from offering a host of wellness classes, like yoga, they also brought in a free meditation program. Anyone who wanted to join was allowed to take an hour out of their work day to practice mindfulness meditation with a teacher who came into the office once a week.\n\nThis made a huge difference in my overall work satisfaction, and actually helped to reduce my anxiety. At my next job, meditation teacher and career coach Amy Sandler, who became a close friend, led our team in regular meditation exercises. She has since dedicated her career to bring meditation into the workplace because, as she wrote for the Vistage blog: \"Workplace mindfulness enhances emotional intelligence, notably self-awareness and the capacity to manage challenging emotions. Neurologist and psychologist Viktor Frankl describes, 'Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.'\"\n\nIf your workplace doesn't currently have a wellness program, it never hurts to ask. There are plenty of virtual programs that your employer can give you access to. If you want to participate in a meditation on World Mental Health Day, Lady Gaga, who has become a champion for mental health awareness in recent years, is hosting her second global meditation Oct. 10 at 4 p.m. PT, 7 p.m. ET on Instagram Live. You can also download meditation apps and take a break to meditate during the day when it's convenient for you.\n\n3. Practice Kindness\n\nOK, this is something we can all do every day. However, I know how easy it is to get so caught up in the microcosm of your daily life that sometimes you forget to be kind to others. Small acts of kindness can make a big difference in someone's day, and even their life. The Kindness Movement posted 50 ways to be kind at work, and with World Mental Health Day 2017 being all about mental health in the workplace, practicing these acts of kindness is a great way to support others.\n\nSmall things like making a new colleague feel welcome, mentoring a colleague, offering to help, providing encouragement, taking the time to really listen, and more can make your workplace a much more enjoyable place to be. Consider starting a kindness movement at work. Because, being kind doesn't cost you anything, and it's never the wrong choice.\n\n4. Offer Support To Friends & Loved Ones\n\nOne of the most isolating things about mental illness is feeling like you're the only one. Finding the right kind of mental health care is difficult. It's a never-ending game of medical musical chairs searching for a doctor who gets you, the right combination of traditional and alternative treatments, and it can take years because everyone is different, which means that each person responds differently to the same treatment.\n\nFeeling like you're navigating this all alone is terrifying and exhausting. If you have a friend or loved one who is navigating mental health challenges, let them know that you're there for them, and take the time to really listen to what they're telling you. You don't have to try to fix it, just being available to offer a safe, judgment-free space is a huge gift.\n\n5. Speak Out About Mental Health\n\nThere's an old saying in recovery circles that goes, \"you're only as sick as your secrets.\" Staying silent about depression, whether you are directly affected by it or not, helps keep people sick. Speaking up is hard. Trust me, I get it. For years I didn't tell anyone I was depressed despite battling depression since I was a kid. When I finally spoke out, my admission was met with shock, and many people said, \"but you don't look depressed.\"\n\nDepression doesn't have a look, and seeming fine is fairly common for people struggling with mental illness, as this powerful story about Linkin Park frontman Chester Bennington's happy social media posts just days before his death illustrates. Many people are afraid to speak out about their depression because there is still a stigma that surrounds mental illness. We're afraid we won't get jobs, that people will avoid us, be afraid of us, and judge us. Every time someone speaks out about mental illness it helps to reduce the stigma.\n\nSmall acts of support by every single person on the planet could totally change the way we view mental health. But, on a smaller scale, if you commit to supportive acts for World Mental Health Day 2017, you just might change someone's life.", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/p/what-is-world-mental-health-day-5-ways-to-show-your-support-this-year-2840310", "summary": "Oct. 10 is dedicated annually to raising awareness about mental health issues around the world and to mobilize efforts in support of mental health, according to the World Health Organization.\nBecause mental health informs every area of your life, the theme for World Mental Health Day 2017 is mental health in the workplace.\nBecause adults spent a lot of time at work, addressing mental health at work is an important part of advancing the mental health conversation.\nHere are some ways you can support World Mental Health Day 2017 at work, and everywhere else.\nBut, on a smaller scale, if you commit to supportive acts for World Mental Health Day 2017, you just might change someone's life.", "timescraped": 1513838362.595668, "category": {"words": 1317, "personal": 21, "thirdperson": 11, "condition": 44, "recovery": 1}}, "16be867ed89a955f72a9a097f28ca19e": {"title": "8 Reasons The Stigma About Depression Needs To End, Because It's A Disease, Not A Choice", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost%2F2016%2F9%2F13%2F17e8294a-6d49-49b7-95d4-d788a8c177fc.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "text": "Despite its prevalence in our society, clinical depression remains a taboo topic of discussion for many people and a widely stigmatized illness in general. Which is a bit shocking, considering that depression is the most common mental illness in the United States, with approximately 17 percent of Americans experiencing a major depressive episode at least once during their lifetime. It's estimated that approximately 80 percent of people with clinical depression are not being treated for their symptoms, which can include loss of interest in activities, disturbances in sleep and appetite, and low self-esteem \u2014 and going without treatment can increase the likelihood of suicide.\n\n\n\nYet despite all this, many people still try to pretend that depression doesn't exist, or that a depressed person can be \"talked out of it\" (never mind the fact that the old adage \"pull yourself up by your bootstraps\" doesn't exactly apply when someone is battling a complex psychological disorder). The stigmatization of depression does nothing to help or encourage those grappling with depression \u2014 in fact, treating depression as a personal problem instead of a real illness can lead depressed people to avoid seeking professional help and instead blame themselves for their depression.\n\n\n\nSimply put, depression is a serious illness, not a sign of weakness or a character flaw. Even if you never experience clinical depression, you're bound to encounter plenty of people in your life who are currently suffering or have suffered in the past \u2014 even if they haven't told you about it. So it's important to fight against stigmatization, even if you think it has nothing to do with your life. if you need more convincing, check out these eight reasons why the stigmatization of depression needs to become a thing of the past.\n\n\n\n1. Stigmatizing Depression Is Ignorant\n\n\n\nYou've never suffered from depression? That's great! I'm serious. I am sincerely happy for anyone who's never dealt with depression, because no one deserves to suffer like that. But while people who have never suffered from depression may be lucky, they're not better or stronger people that those who have struggled with depression \u2014 and that luck is not an excuse to judge people who haven't been as fortunate.\n\n\n\nIf you choose to stigmatize depression, it's probably because you haven't taken the time to educate yourself. I'm not saying everyone needs go out and buy a psychology textbook to understand depression \u2014 but there are plenty of resources available online that can help you learn a lot in a very short period of time. It's well worth it to spend a few hours reading up on the causes of depression, the symptoms, and how it's treated. You'll be better-equipped to recognize the warning signs and help a loved one who is suffering \u2014 or to extend empathy towards any other depressed people in your life.\n\n\n\n2. No One Chooses To Have An Illness\n\n\n\nWhen someone is afflicted with a serious physical illness, we typically don't hear callous gossip about their laziness or how they're clearly not trying to recover. Talking that way about a person with a physical illness is pretty socially unacceptable \u2014 and for good reason.\n\n\n\nBut it's all too common to hear depression described as someone's failure to buck up and accept that life just isn't a picnic for anyone. \"I mean, we all have problems!\" Sigh. The bottom line is that depression isn't a figment of the sufferer's imagination. It's an illness caused by a combination of chemical imbalances and flawed mood regulators in the brain, which is hardly within the sufferer's control.\n\n3. Stigmas Can Make Sufferers Feel Guilty\n\n\n\nYour self-esteem is generally not at an all-time high when you're suffering from depression. And when you look around and see people stigmatizing your illness, it's easy to adopt their views and stigmatize yourself. It's easy to wonder if maybe you really are just weak and wallowing, like they say. Maybe this truly is a choice and you just need to snap out of it. Never mind that depression is caused by genes and chemistry \u2014 if no one else seems to care about the scientific facts, why should you? This self-perpetuation only worsens depression and deters people from seeking help from friends and mental health professionals. A few thoughtless words can have a real impact on the depressed people around you.\n\n\n\n4. Stigmas Make People Less Likely To Open Up To Friends\n\n\n\nIf someone anticipates judgement and an accompanying lecture about how \"happiness is a choice,\" they're not going to be open with friends about their struggles with depression. This is unfortunate, because when friends are supportive they can be a great source of hope and strength. Depression is an isolating illness and while no one single person can change that, it can mean a lot when friends want to understand what you're going through. It can help depressed people realize that they have nothing to be ashamed of \u2014 which can then motivate them to seek treatment.\n\n\n\n5. Stigmas Can Deter Sufferers From Seeking Professional Help\n\n\n\nStudies have shown that fear of judgement deters people from seeking professional help for their depression. Many people suffering from depression believe seeing a mental health professional would illicit a negative reaction from other people in their life \u2014 some even fear the judgement of doctors and therapists themselves. Since over 80 percent of people who do get treatment for depression report that it helps, having the courage to seek treatment is a key element of recovery \u2014 and it can be tough to summon that courage when you're hearing a lot of messages about how the depression that is touching every part of your life isn't even a real illness.\n\n\n\n6. Stigmas Breed Dangerous Misconceptions\n\n\n\nAfter a tragic event like a mass shooting, media sources will often offer the obligatory report that the perpetrator had a \"history of mental illness.\" This vague comment lumps all mental illnesses together, when in reality there are a vast array of mental conditions with wildly different symptoms. But the real problem with the discourse is that it promotes a stereotype that's not accurate: A study conducted by North Carolina State University in 2014 showed that mentally ill individuals are more likely to be the victims of violence \u2014 not the perpetrators.\n\n\n\nWhile it's true that many perpetrators of crimes and violence are mentally unwell, we need to stop focusing on the idea that people with depression are dangerous \u2014 because, generally, this is far from true. Our focus needs to shift towards promoting a culture that encourages people to seek help without the fear of judgement.\n\n\n\n7. Stigmas Can Lead To Inadequate Insurance Coverage\n\n\n\nThe stigmatization of depression is so ingrained in society that it's even written into our laws. While private insurance companies and the Affordable Care Act require coverage for those suffering from depression and other mental illnesses, Medicaid and Medicare laws are a different story. When the Medicaid law was written over fifty years ago, Congress included a provision declaring funds may be used for hospitals treating physical ailments, but not mental illnesses. A half century and boatloads of research later, the law remains the same. Similarly, Medicare places limitations on the amount of time an individual can spend in an inpatient psychiatric unit, while there is no such maximum for inpatient treatment of a physical illness. Stigmas that present mental illness as unseemly or \"not a real disease\" keep laws like this in place, even when they fly in the face of modern medical knowledge.\n\n\n\n8. Stigmas Cause Workplace Discrimination\n\n\n\nResearch has shown that the majority of people with depression want to work and are fully capable of being productive members of the workforce. However, a whopping 50 percent of employers say they would be reluctant to hire an individual who is being treated for depression. This is extremely troubling \u2014 not only because depressed people need money to survive, just like everyone else, but because, for many individuals, the structure and productivity of a work day can aid in recovery. And, not surprisingly, many individuals who are employed report feeling ostracized by colleagues if information about their depression is discovered. Sure, it's unavoidable that people will bring their personal biases to the workplace. But if we didn't demonize people with depression, painting them as dangerous or incapable, this kind of discrimination would be viewed as completely unacceptable. Very few people who stigmatize depression and mental illness are doing so on purpose. But thoughtless words and outdated attitudes can help perpetuate these kind of harmful stereotypes.\n\n\n\nImages: shandilee/Flickr; Giphy (7); oneonlychance/Tumblr\n\n", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/95076-8-reasons-the-stigma-about-depression-needs-to-end-because-its-a-disease-not-a-choice", "summary": "Simply put, depression is a serious illness, not a sign of weakness or a character flaw.\nif you need more convincing, check out these eight reasons why the stigmatization of depression needs to become a thing of the past.\nStigmas Can Make Sufferers Feel GuiltyYour self-esteem is generally not at an all-time high when you're suffering from depression.\nIt can help depressed people realize that they have nothing to be ashamed of \u2014 which can then motivate them to seek treatment.\nVery few people who stigmatize depression and mental illness are doing so on purpose.", "timescraped": 1513838363.895282, "category": {"words": 1448, "personal": 10, "thirdperson": 21, "condition": 43, "recovery": 1}}, "467939c1d68048112d6f8c94dec52a8a": {"title": "Is Binge Eating A Mental Illness? 5 Facts About The Disorder You Should Know", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost%2F2016%2F9%2F13%2F8b2c2f10-ba1e-4934-a6a0-b925d98b27af.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "text": "You might think binge eating is just a thing college-aged stoners or recently dumped people do, but in many cases, regular binge eating is actually an eating disorder that needs to be treated. In fact, in 2010, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) released a new version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Eating Disorders, officially listing binge eating disorder (BED) as a mental illness. To be clear here: we\u2019re not talking just occasional Sunday sessions of overeating at brunch or late night snacking (let\u2019s face it, we all need those from time to time). In its clinically diagnosed form, binge eating is a secret demon that can feel unbeatable.\n\nAnorexia and bulimia nervosa have been at the forefront of discussions about eating disorders for a long time. Lately, though, we are hearing more about how destructive bingeing can be, both physically and mentally.

Binge Eaters Aren't Necessarily Overweight\n\n\n\n[Embed]\n\nI kept my bingeing under wraps for ages by making sure I never got bigger than a size 4 and maintaining a regular fitness regimen. Similarly, yo-yo eating, dieting fads, and even the occasional fast or two can be used in between regular sessions of bingeing to stave off noticeable weight gain, making BED outwardly invisible in many cases.\n\nWhen the APA released revisions of the DSM in 2010, it stated that numerous doctors had been incorrectly using weight loss regimes to treat patients grappling with bingeing. Because many people who suffer from BED are not obese, simply addressing the number on the scale ignores the psychological issues that are at play. Most of those who undergo treatments specifically geared to losing weight find themselves grappling with bingeing once again shortly after.\n \n2. Bingeing Isn\u2019t Always Followed By Purging\n\n[Embed]\n\nThe last time you heard the term \u201cbinge\u201d it was most likely followed by talk of puking. Yes, the connection between bingeing (by the way, that is the proper way to spell it; not \u201cbinging\u201d) and purging are real symptoms of bulimia nervosa, but the latter doesn\u2019t always follow the former. Due to the automatic link we make between the two, we then wrongly assume that those who overeat but don\u2019t purge only have one problem \u2014 they simply need to learn when to put their fork down.\n\n\n\n\u201cFood addiction\u201d is a factor that appears strongly in BED (but not in bulimia) and doctors are considering addiction recovery treatments to address it. What makes this particular addiction extremely difficult to care for, unlike alcohol or drug dependency, is that food consumption is necessary for survival. Complete abstinence is not an option, so the programs used to heal BED need to be constructed differently.\n\n3. It\u2019s Very, Very Easy To Hide\n\n[Embed]\n\nExtra slices of cake, a few bags of Cape Cod salt and vinegar chips, Chinese takeout \u2014 it all gets consumed behind closed doors, usually after a particularly stressful day. Overeating in isolation is constructed in the mind as a reward, a guilty pleasure in the likes of watching Keeping Up With the Kardashians marathons. Plus, the hangover after an all-nighter nosh is imperceptible to the human eye. There is no faint smell of alcohol or milky red eyes to blow your cover. Maybe there is a faint stomachache, but none of the aftermath is visible on the body.\n\nEven scarier is the fact that a person afflicted by BED could appear to be the healthiest person at your office. She might always say no to sugar and pack a healthy lunch. Secrecy is the foundation of BED, and I know I used to spend a lot of time and energy hiding my unhealthy relationship with food.\n\nThere is much shame and guilt involved with bingeing, leaving little room for candid discussion, which leads me to\u2026\n\n4. The Stigma Can Be Crippling\n\n[Embed]\n\nEating large amounts of food isn\u2019t exactly considered sexy in today\u2019s society (when was the last time you saw platinum January Jones chow down on cheesy enchiladas?), making it almost impossible for women to come forward and admit their struggles publicly. We\u2019ll talk about binge drinking and binge shopping, two closely related disorders that are triggered in the same part of the brain, because they aren\u2019t nearly as \u201cdisgusting.\u201d The first person I tried to confess my bingeing to looked at me with such revulsion it brought me to tears. I thought, \"Am I really that gross?\"\n\n\n\nWhen the FDA recently approved the ADHD drug Vyvanse to be used for patients with BED, it sparked vibrant conversation about our society\u2019s view on this disease. L.V. Anderson of Slate wrote a personal response, reminding us that many still don\u2019t truly believe BED to be a legitimate eating disorder. For the first time, we are witnessing honest, informative dialogue that will hopefully change the way we think about BED and the people it affects.\n\n5. Mindfullness Is A Key Part Of Treatment\n\n[Embed]\n\nEmotions surge strongly through the body when the urge to binge appears, and when they aren\u2019t harnessed they take over and, bam, the tubs of ice cream in the freezer are empty. It is proven that mindfulness techniques help ease the stressful mental states that accompany anxiety and depression, both of which are strongly linked to BED. Being fully aware of our emotions leads to more conscious choices in how and what we eat. Like all forms of therapy, mindful meditation is not a cure for eating disorders, but it is certainly a good place to start.\n\nAs a yoga teacher, I've seen mindfulness bring an overall improvement to people's lives, encouraging us to be more present and connected. And using daily meditation has helped me get in touch with how I truly feel when I briefly consider eating an extra large pizza (or two). The happier we are and the more we are at peace, the more likely we are going to find healing from mental illnesses. It\u2019s no secret that our culture sends us daily messages on how women should look and eat \u2014 but the best way to wade through all the   is to reach a healthy, honest place with yourself.\n\nEditor's Note: If you're struggling with binge eating, help is available.

In recognition, each day this week, we\u2019ll be featuring a piece about women\u2019s body image. And please, remember: If you\u2019re struggling with your body image or an eating disorder, you\u2019re not alone, and help is available.\n\n\n\nFeb. 22 marked the beginning of National Eating Disorder Awareness Week, an annual outreach effort by the National Eating Disorders Association designed to help the public learn more about the signs and risks of eating disorders. This year's theme, \"I Had No Idea,\" focuses on addressing the most-overlooked symptoms and behaviors of those with eating disorders; signs that their friends and family often miss, either because they\u2019re not educated enough on the topic, or are simply in denial. But since early intervention and treatment offer the best chance of recovery for those afflicted with eating disorders, becoming familiar with the symptoms and signs of the illness is crucial.\n\n\n\nAccording to the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associate Disorders, 24 million people in the United suffer from eating disorders. Those most affected by the disease are women in their teens and early 20s, but tragically, kids as young as five years old can also be affected. Eating disorders also have the highest mortality rate of any mental illness.\n\nAs with any mental illness, educating ourselves about eating disorders like anorexia, bulimia, and binge eating are one of the most important methods of combating them. During National Eating Disorder Awareness Week, let\u2019s all take the time to make sure we're really informed about the disease and how it impacts those who suffer from it. Here are nine things about eating disorders that everyone should know, to help our loved ones, and ourselves.\n\n1. Eating Disorders Are A Mental Illness\n\nFar too often, eating disorders are dismissed as simply a compulsion to look thin, a phase that the sufferer will grow out of. But they\u2019re so much more than that. According to Mental Health America, eating disorders are a mental illness that stems from \u201csociocultural, psychological and biological factors.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn fact, it has been found that eating disorders run in families, leading scientists to believe that there is a genetic component. Those who have a mother or sister who is anorexic are 12 times more likely to develop the disease, and four times more likely develop bulimia than those in families where eating disorders are not present. And while research remains inconclusive, some scientists believe that one of those possible biological factors may be an imbalance in the brain chemicals that control hunger and appetite.\n\n\n\nAnd eating disorders are often just one of several mental illnesses that sufferers are struggling with. For example, 50 percent of those with an eating disorder also suffer from depression.\n\n2. Eating Disorders Kill More Often Than Any Other Mental Illness\n\n\n\nEating disorders have the highest mortality rate of all mental illnesses, and women between the ages of 15 and 24 who have an eating disorder are 12 times more likely to die from it than from any other cause.\n\n\n\nRoughly 20 percent of those with eating disorders will die prematurely, due to either heart problems from the physical stress of the disease, or suicide from the mental stress of it.\n\n3. Women In Their Teens And Early 20s Are Most Affected\n\nThe National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders has found that 86 percent of women develop an eating disorder before the age of 20, 43 percent develop them between ages 16 and 20, and 95 percent of those who suffer from eating disorders are between 12 and 25. Anorexia accounts for a third of all chronic illnesses among teens, and 25 percent of college women resort to binging and purging as a means to keep their weight down.\n\n\n\n4. Eating Disorders Affect Men Too\n\nWhile women are more likely to develop an eating disorder, men are affected, too. Of the 24 million people (of all genders) who suffer from eating disorders, about four to 10 percent of those with anorexia or bulimia are male, according to the National Eating Disorders Association. But among gay men those rates are higher; 14 percent of gay men suffer from bulimia, and 20 percent are afflicted with anorexia. Men are typically less likely to get help for an eating disorder than women because of the stigma that it\u2019s a \u201cwoman\u2019s disease.\u201d\n\n5. Girls Are Developing Eating Disorders At Earlier Ages\n\n\n\nAccording to Dr. Gene Beresin, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, anorexia nervosa has two peak times when women are most likely to be afflicted with the disease \u2014 first between the ages of 10 to 13, and then between the ages of 13 to 18. However, that hasn't stopped girls as young as five and six from suffering from eating disorders.\n\n\n\nStudies have found that 42 percent of girls in 1st to 3rd grade want to be thinner and 81 percent of 10-year-old girls are genuinely afraid of getting fat. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that the hospitalization for eating disorders in kids younger than 12 jumped by 119 percent from 1999 to 2006.\n\n6. One Person Can Have Multiple Types Of Eating Disorders\n\n\n\nAlthough bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa are different diseases \u2014 bulimia involves binge eating then \"purging\" or vomiting, while anorexia makes sufferers restrict their eating, or not eat at all \u2014 the two can sometimes overlap. According to Mental Health America, 50 percent of anorexics will also develop patterns of bulimia, adopting binging and purging in addition to restricted eating as they try to keep their weight down.\n\n\n\n7. Most People With Eating Disorders Aren't Getting Help\n\nOnly one in 10 people struggling with eating disorders get help, either on their own or because they\u2019re pressured by friends and family. And of those people getting treatment for the illness, only 35 percent are able to get specialized treatment at an eating disorder facility.\n\n\n\n8. Recovery From An Eating Disorder Is Possible\n\nAccording to eating disorder awareness site ANRED, 60 percent of people with eating disorders will recover if they seek treatment. As with all mental illnesses, no one is ever \"cured;\" but while they may struggle, many people who have suffered from an eating disorder can go on to maintain a healthy lifestyle.\n\n\n\nHowever, 20 percent will only make a partial recovery even with treatment, which means that while they may look like they have things in check on the surface, psychologically, they\u2019re still participating in eating disorder related behavior.\n\n", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/65550-9-facts-about-eating-disorders-you-should-know", "summary": "Feb. 22 marked the beginning of National Eating Disorder Awareness Week, an annual outreach effort by the National Eating Disorders Association designed to help the public learn more about the signs and risks of eating disorders.\nHere are nine things about eating disorders that everyone should know, to help our loved ones, and ourselves.\nEating Disorders Are A Mental IllnessFar too often, eating disorders are dismissed as simply a compulsion to look thin, a phase that the sufferer will grow out of.\nMost People With Eating Disorders Aren't Getting HelpOnly one in 10 people struggling with eating disorders get help, either on their own or because they\u2019re pressured by friends and family.\nRecovery From An Eating Disorder Is PossibleAccording to eating disorder awareness site ANRED, 60 percent of people with eating disorders will recover if they seek treatment.", "timescraped": 1513838366.4546628, "category": {"words": 1069, "personal": 2, "thirdperson": 13, "condition": 11, "recovery": 4}}, "67190c62f9b3b7163d9dee312a68b0f5": {"title": "Mental Health Awareness Week: 6 Reasons to Get Your Butt to the Therapist", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost%2F2016%2F9%2F13%2F3c4161c0-1ef0-45e5-8a1d-6102bbcaacbf.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "text": "It's Mental Health Awareness Week and in honor of this occasion we're here to encourage you to GO TO A THERAPIST ALREADY. Like health insurance, an updated resume and a reliable source of orgasms, it's something every young woman should have on hand in case of emergencies. Think of it as dental floss for your psyche, pinpointing and shaking loose all the residual gunk and helping to render your mental space clean and cavity-free. Here are six reasons you should get thee to ZocDoc and make an appointment.\n\n1. Going to therapy doesn't mean you're nuts.\n\n\"Going to therapy doesn't mean you're weak or crazy or don't know how to take care of yourself. It just means you're having a hard time right now. And much of the therapy offered these days is designed to help people work through their problems in a fairly short amount of time,\" Jennifer Yashari, MD, a clinical instructor of psychiatry at UCLA told Ladies Home Journal. \"There are lots of women who could benefit from seeing a therapist but don't ever do it.\" Men, too.\n\nIf you feel like you're dealing with the onset of serious mental illness, it's obviously wise to explore therapy. But if you're feeling moody or confused or in a funk or not like yourself, that's worth a therapy session too.\n\n2. Everyone is doing it!\n\nIn major cities at least. In 2011, there were 4,478 licensed psychologists practicing in NYC, or one for every 1,868 people. Los Angeles has one for every 2,380 people. According to HMO stats, Manhattan may have the highest concentration of psychotherapy referrals in the country.\n\nAnecdotally, I lived with 11 women in college and I believe that only one of them has not, at one point or another, seen a therapist. My coworkers, bosses, boyfriends and family members have all benefited from psychotherapy and, at least among the segment of society that I occupy, use of psychotherapy is simply too ubiquitous to feel embarrassed about. Sometimes we all need a little help.\n\n3. Your friends aren't your therapists.\n\nMaybe they're sick of hearing you talk about your toxic relationship with your mother and your disappointment in your career and your irresistible ex-boyfriend. Or maybe they just give really bad advice and you could stand to speak to someone who does this professionally. But, do keep in mind that the relationship between you and your therapist is, at its core, an exchange of goods and services. Cause one day she might, just to pull an example out of thin air, charge you a no-show fee when you have to go to an unexpected funeral and that might sting a little and maybe you'll get over it but maybe you'll need the help of another therapist to do so. Sorry, where was I?\n\n4. It feels good.\n\nYou know how you kinda dread going to the gym and while you're there it's really hard but afterwards you feel like a million bucks? Therapy can do that for your brain. The same way you leave those extra calories at the gym, you can leave that extra mental weight behind at the head doctor. It can be healthy and cathartic and mentally refreshing. And, though psychotherapy that is sought as part of a treatment program for serious mental illness may not yield such immediate satisfaction, there is comfort in the fact that you are taking steps toward your own recovery. You're doing something healthy for yourself.\n\n5. Your health insurance might pay for it.\n\nMental health coverage may vary significantly from insurer to insurer, therapist to therapist and diagnosis to diagnosis. But, The Washington Post says that all insurance under Obamacare has to cover a predetermined set of health benefits, one of which is mental health services. Not only may this provide financial relief for people that use these services, it will destigmatize mental health services by lumping them in with other required health benefits like emergency services, hospitalization, preventative care and chronic disease management.\n\n6. It's good for you in all sorts of ways.\n\nIt's proven that therapy effectively decreases patients' depression and anxiety. The American Psychological Association states that \"There is convincing evidence that most people who have at least several sessions of therapy are far better off than untreated individuals with emotional difficulties.\" What may surprise you is that therapy can improve a patient's overall health status, both mental and physical. In addition to easing anxiety and depression, psychotherapy also decreases related symptoms like pain, fatigue and nausea, according to the American Psychological Association. It's also been found to increase survival time for cancer and heart surgery patients.

And in the cases of many sufferers, families and friends may simply not believe in its existence, instead labeling it as exaggeration, laziness, selfishness, or an attempt to punish other people. Understandably, if you're already struggling with serious negative thoughts and imbalanced brain chemistry, this is not going to help. But how can you explain depression to the non-believers?\n\nDepression is a fact. It was not invented by Big Pharma; melancholia has been a recognized condition throughout the centuries, and while we're only just beginning to understand how it manifests in the brain, it definitely exists. But explaining it to people who come from a position of denial poses a lot of problems. One is that depression differs wildly from person to person, and that there are at least nine different types, including situational depression, postpartum depression, dysthymia, and major depression \u2014 so it's difficult to make it understandable in a one-size-fits-all way.\n\nAnother is that depressive symptoms are often misunderstood as escapable by pure force of will: it's not like you turn purple and swell to the size of Nevada. You can't defeat measles by thinking really positively. The symptoms are mental, which means it's harder for people to conceive of them as serious, outside your control, and medical in nature. Plus, mental illness is still, in some areas of society, a taboo, suggesting that you are in some way \"wrong,\" \"dangerous,\" or \"broken\" \u2014 which may make it difficult for others to accept the diagnosis.\n\nExperiencing depression in an environment that doesn't support or believe in it is going to be extremely challenging. (Believe me, I know.) Here are a few ideas to help you explain the situation, in a way that might turn their perspective around.\n\n1. Ask about why they don't believe in it.\n\nThis could be the real key to figuring out what's going on and convincing them to think otherwise. Do they think depression is an invention? That our happiness is all down to our willpower and mental strength? That it only happens to weak people or the confused?\n\n\n\nThis will likely get difficult for you \u2014 depressives do not, understandably, cope well with being told it's all in their heads and they're failures \u2014 but it may be necessary. We're formulating a plan of attack here, and you need to know the opponent's position.\n\n2. Be frank about how much you're struggling.\n\nOpenness about the seriousness of your struggle and how dark things have become may be the spark that's required for them to believe you. Do not hold back: the sleeplessness, the weeping, the self-harm, whatever you're feeling, all there on the table. Be frank and calm; do not exaggerate, appear as rational as possible, and rehearse it a bit beforehand if you need to.\n\nParents, family, and friends who don't like hearing about emotions will not appreciate this approach, in which case it's possibly better to target them with the science first (see #5).\n\n3. Be prepared for ignorant questions and outright rejections.\n\n\"But last week, at Emily's wedding, you were smiling!\" \"Oh, you're just exaggerating for attention, stop it.\" \"If you really wanted to stop being sad, you could.\" These kinds of comments might be thrown at you. If possible, do not get into a position where these things could be said if you're not ready to deal with it.\n\nChances are, you'll have heard this sort of song-and-dance before. Rehearse answers, if rational answers can be had. For instance, explaining that depression can come and go, or outlining your own efforts to defeat depression with pure willpower (see #4). And minimize accusations of attention-seeking by having this conversation privately.\n\n4. Highlight your wish to get better, and how denying it isn't solving anything.\n\nYou will possibly be told you could decide to snap out of it if you wanted to, or weren't so weak. It's valuable, in these situations, to have a counter-argument prepared: how you've tried to combat it on your own, and couldn't. (Because that is how depression works. You can't just magically talk yourself out of it.)\n\nTell them all the things you wish you could still do \u2014 get out of bed, see friends, enjoy what you once loved doing \u2014 and the invisible psychological wall standing in your way. Leave it in no doubt that you are trying. Because you are, and you're very brave.\n\n5. Have the science on hand.\n\nThis won't help for everybody, but if they're the kind of people to pay attention to facts and figures, have studies and respectable websites on hand to prove that it exists.\n\n\n\nI once overheard a father tell his daughter a meant-to-be-helpful story about a coworker who \"thought he was depressed, and he walked around all day so sad, so upset, but then he went home and it was just gas!\" Science may not be able to combat that kind of thinking, but a link to the Royal College Of Psychiatrists, the Washington School of Medicine, or even the World Health Organization may come in handy. WHO lays out the devastating fact that 350 million people worldwide suffer from depression, the Washington School points out that 17.5 million Americans have some form (and that it's likely to be inherited), and the RSP outlines the benefits of common treatments.\n\n6. Back up diagnosis with validation from somewhere they trust.\n\nHell, even Fox News treats depression as a valid mental illness. If the non-believers are more likely to believe a doctor than you, get a doctor; look for positive quotes about depression from politicians or parties that they follow; and if they look to religious leaders for guidance, cite them.\n\n\n\nThere's widespread openness about depression among pastors in the Christian faith, for example, and Islam has positive views on helping depressives. (This last decision may backfire, though: there's a strand of evangelical Christianity that believes depression is a choice and can be cured by prayer alone.)\n\n7. Be wary of comments about simply \"getting over it\" with drugs.\n\n\"So you're depressed. So you take a pill, you're fine, right?\"\n\n\n\nThis is a particularly tricky conversation if the people you're convincing are the ones who would pay for these options. If you can, try to research the easiest, cheapest, and most convenient options locally, from therapy to regular exercise to antidepressants.\n\nAlso, some people accept the depression but refuse point-blank to accept your taking drugs to defeat it. This isn't uncommon, but remember, these medications can be very useful, often lifesaving, things. Only you and a doctor can know what's right for you.\n\n8. Convey that recovery is going to take a long time, if ever.\n\nSome people will never come around to the idea that a person they love and respect has an illness they don't believe in (or think only happens to a \"certain type\" of person). This is, unfortunately, one of those tricky parts of life that make for fantastic novels and sh*tty family reunions. Try to be kind and understanding. I know it sucks. I am here, and I believe you, and even if those close to you do not, there will be people who do.\n\n\n\n9. Understand they may treat you differently.\n\nIf they do come around, having a family or support circle who do believe you're depressed may not be more fun than one that doesn't. They may not understand you, catastrophize, get scared for your safety, ostracize you socially, worry that you're ruining their reputation, or keep you away from others to stop it from \"spreading\".\n\nThis is a new frontier, in which you'll have to target an entirely new enemy: preconceptions and myths about mental illness. Be prepared for the future to require even more hard work, but be assured that help is out there\n\nImages: gratisography/Pexels; Giphy", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/92542-how-to-explain-depression-to-people-who-dont-believe-its-real", "summary": "One is that depression differs wildly from person to person, and that there are at least nine different types, including situational depression, postpartum depression, dysthymia, and major depression \u2014 so it's difficult to make it understandable in a one-size-fits-all way.\nExperiencing depression in an environment that doesn't support or believe in it is going to be extremely challenging.\nFor instance, explaining that depression can come and go, or outlining your own efforts to defeat depression with pure willpower (see #4).\nIf they do come around, having a family or support circle who do believe you're depressed may not be more fun than one that doesn't.\nThis is a new frontier, in which you'll have to target an entirely new enemy: preconceptions and myths about mental illness.", "timescraped": 1513838368.9612339, "category": {"words": 1325, "personal": 8, "thirdperson": 24, "condition": 19, "recovery": 1}}, "ab4ce3338c3bf8e35c5de1ed9fb17d25": {"title": "5 Things Too Much Screen Time Does To Your Body", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost%2F2016%2F9%2F13%2Fcd23933c-e942-494d-bec2-5650dc55faad.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "text": "When I was a kid, the only warning we had been given about technology and our health focused on televisions: \"too much TV will make your eyes go square.\" But these days, as all kinds of screen-based devices \u2014 tablets, iPods, laptops, mobile phones \u2014 are common in our everyday lives, scientists have been focused on figuring out what screen time does to the body and brain. And even if you steer clear of the hysteria and tabloid reporting on the issue, a lot of the facts don't look particularly good.\n\nMost of the research on screen time focuses on kids, because, after all, that's where the biggest difference in lifestyle is. Adults may stare at computers all day as a simple matter of course \u2014 you'd be hard-pressed to find a standard 9-to-5 that doesn't involve a screen \u2014 but children are supposed to be gleefully climbing trees, throwing apples at Nancy-Lou and engaging in other traditional manifestations of childhood, not staring at a smartphone for hours on end. Being concerned about whether children are spending too much time around screens is not exactly a new worry, but it's a field where some interesting new conclusions have been found recently. But what about adults in dorm rooms and bedrooms, scrolling Tumblr or texting until late at night? Are screens really causing prolonged physical effects on them, too?\n\nThe answer, appears to be \"yes, under certain circumstances.\" We all know about how excess device use impacts our sleep \u2014 using bright devices before bed can cause poor quality sleep, according to medical advice \u2014 but that appears to be only the beginning of the real effect. Reading on, and learn about five ways your excessive screen time changes your body.\n\n\n\n1. Your Brain Restructures\n\nAccording to Psychology Today, one of the fundamental consequences that a large amount of screen time has on adults is a restructuring of the matter that makes up your brain. (The brain consists of grey matter, the heavy bit that makes up the folds, and white matter, which transmits messages between neurons.) These results don't apply to everyone \u2014 they're all proven consequences of screen addiction, which is a psychological condition based around severely excessive use of electronic devices \u2014 but folks who aren't addicts but do use their devices heavily may experience some version of the same restructuring. Too much screen usage seems to result in grey matter shrinkage, problems with white matter's ability to communicate, a lot more cravings, and general poorer cognitive performance. Not great news, guys.\n\n\n\n2. You're More Vulnerable To Metabolic Syndrome\n\nThis particular finding comes from a 2008 study of adolescents, but its thinking still seems to hold true for folks of other ages. Metabolic syndrome combines diabetes, obesity and high blood pressure; it's a pretty toxic cocktail of poor health, apparently linked to an abnormally sedentary lifestyle. (You'll notice a pattern in this; the bodily damage done by screen time often doesn't have much to do with the screen itself, but rather hinges on the the fact that we sit still while binge-watching.) But the 2008 study found a a pretty strong link between screen time and metabolic syndrome, even if the kids also did a bunch of physical activity after the fact \u2014 so the effects of sitting still for hours can't be undone with a single brisk walk.\n\n\n\n3. You're More Vulnerable To Eye Strain\n\nYeah, yeah, my parents were right. My eyes may not have turned square, but it's pretty well-recognised by the medical community that too much screen time is seriously bad for the peepers. Blue light from screens isn't just keeping us awake; it may also damage the retina , and eye strain from too much device use is increasing. A report by CBS had a few recommendations, including the 20-20-20 rule: after 20 minutes of staring at a screen, look at an object at least 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Plus, try to use the dimmer switch on your devices rather than letting them burn brightly for hours.\n\n\n\n4. You May Not Be As Able To Process Emotions As Previous Generations\n\n\n\nThis is an intriguing one. It's a contentious discovery in children \u2014 several places, including HBO and NPR, have hosted controversial specials about whether screen time really inhibits the emotional development of kids \u2014 but it may impact adults, too. Even if you didn't grow up with an iPad within reach, lack of frequent face-to-face interaction, in favor of Facebook and other simulated emotional connections, may actually impact on your ability to process emotion properly. The results for adults aren't in yet, but it doesn't seem like such a far-flung idea; even late adopters can be seriously damaged by a technology.\n\n\n\n5. You're Likely To Die Earlier\n\nFor decades, studies have indicated that spending significant time parked in front of a screen \u2014 whether it's a TV, computer or tablet \u2014 lowers cardiovascular health outcomes and increases mortality risk. And the unfortunate thing about this is that exercising more doesn't seem to do much about it. If you're trying to offset your days of playing Skyrim on the couch with healthy amounts of exercise each day, it may not be enough; a 2011 study of 4500 adults showed that lots of screen time raised your likelihood of death by up to 52 percent, while being a good exerciser only lowered that by about 4 percent. So it's not just the sedentary lifestyle; it's something about screen viewing itself that causes our bodies to work less well. If you want to live longer, get fitter, have a healthier heart and be able to talk to your friends properly, it seems that logging off social media immediately and going for a long, long walk might be your best option.\n\nImages: Pexels, Giphy (5)\n\n", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/117838-5-things-too-much-screen-time-does-to-your-body", "summary": "But these days, as all kinds of screen-based devices \u2014 tablets, iPods, laptops, mobile phones \u2014 are common in our everyday lives, scientists have been focused on figuring out what screen time does to the body and brain.\nMost of the research on screen time focuses on kids, because, after all, that's where the biggest difference in lifestyle is.\nReading on, and learn about five ways your excessive screen time changes your body.\nMy eyes may not have turned square, but it's pretty well-recognised by the medical community that too much screen time is seriously bad for the peepers.\nSo it's not just the sedentary lifestyle; it's something about screen viewing itself that causes our bodies to work less well.", "timescraped": 1513838370.231246, "category": {"words": 984, "personal": 9, "thirdperson": 3, "condition": 0, "recovery": 0}}, "822887fa722c25ad4c21f460251ce571": {"title": "11 of the Most Realistic Portrayals of Mental Illness in Novels", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost%2F2017%2F11%2F19%2Fe915026c-ea30-4478-9d1a-74f2d30103e7.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "text": "There is a great tradition of mental illness in fiction. The Victorians loved stashing mad women up in towers or attics, where they could slow-w-wly peel the wallpaper from the walls or moan and groan with such abandon that it would frighten the young governesses trying to catch some sleep down below. Later, books would introduce readers to evil nurses, forced lobotomies, and botched attempts at electro-shock therapy. Needless to say, mental illness was even less understood in the past than it is today.\n\nThe last few decades have brought improvement in the way mental illness is treated and the way it is portrayed in literature. Characters are allowed to come down from the attic and tell their own stories. In memoirs, authors share their experiences in raw, first person accounts.

Part self-help book, part guide to seeking professional support, This Isn't What I Expected is all about overcoming postpartum depression and learning how to not only better understand the illness yourself, but how to explain what you're going through to those around you as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI Thought It Was Just Me (But It Isn't) by Bren\u00e9 Brown\n\nWhy read just one Bren\u00e9 Brown title when you can read two? I Thought It Was Just Me (But It Isn't) reminds readers that what connects us all within the human experience is our shared failings and imperfections \u2014 and perhaps also our equal unwillingness to show those imperfections to the world. As always, Bren\u00e9 Brown encourages women to abandon the desire to be perfect, and instead have the courage to believe that our wildly flawed selves are enough.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Angela Ognev/Instagram", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/116226-9-mental-health-books-for-women-to-make-you-feel-more-balanced-relaxed-and-eenergized", "summary": "Women\u2019s mental illness has been long portrayed in fiction \u2014 from Sylvia Plath\u2019s semi-autobiographical The Bell Jar to Wally Lamb\u2019s She\u2019s Come Undone \u2014 literature is fascinated with leading ladies who are dealing with more than their fair share of psychological hurdles.\nBut how about some mental health books for women struggling with issues in real life?\nAfter all, approximately 29 percent of us girls will seek mental health treatment at some point in our lives.\nWillow Weep for Me illuminates the unique challenges women of color face when dealing with mental illness.\nI Thought It Was Just Me (But It Isn't) by Bren\u00e9 BrownWhy read just one Bren\u00e9 Brown title when you can read two?", "timescraped": 1513838352.175564, "category": {"words": 996, "personal": 19, "thirdperson": 17, "condition": 16, "recovery": 1}}, "02b93dd223a2950126d0fee8b7b933eb": {"title": "During Mental Health Month, Pick Up One Of These 15 Memoirs About Mental Illness That Should Be Required Reading", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost%2F2016%2F9%2F13%2F3e487fad-29e6-470b-b079-40316db65393.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "text": "Mental illness touches every person's life in some way \u2014 that's one of the reasons Mental Health Month was created. Memoirs about mental illness can be invaluable resources, giving insight and detailed, honest accounts about what it actually feels like to deal with a disorder. You know that wise saying, \"Don't judge a woman until you've walked a mile in her shoes?\" Well, these memoirs allow us to slip into the shoes of people who live with these illnesses day in, day out.\n\nFor fellow sufferers, these personal, intimate accounts of eating disorders, schizophrenia, bipolar, depression, and OCD can be life-savers, making a diagnosis seem a little less isolating and a little more manageable. Education and awareness, both for the people who are diagnosed and their supporters, are the keys to recovery, and nothing is more eye-opening than a firsthand account.\n\nThe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration estimated that nearly one in five Americans suffer from some form of mental illness, and in reality, due to underreporting and lack of diagnosis, the number is probably much higher than that. That means you, your sister, your mom, your significant other, or your best friend is living with a mental illness.\n\nSo, take a look through these memoirs about mental illness; so much can be gained by reading what incredibly strong, brave people have written about how they learned to treat, manage, and live with their diagnoses. Reading and learning about these disorders can help erase the stigma they carry, and help you become a source of support and wisdom for yourself, for someone you love, or both.\n\n\n\n\n\nSally Brampton had the life many of us aspire to. She was the founding editor of ELLE magazine, a prize-winning journalist, and a wife and mother. She was literally the \"I don't know how she does it\" woman. But beneath Brampton's glossy, flawless exterior, she was falling apart. As she so poignantly makes clear in her memoir, no amount of success, love, or intelligence can save you from depression.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the course of one terrible year, Brampton slips completely into darkness, her descent hastened by a divorce, a move, a thyroid problem, and alcohol dependency. She was in and out of the hospital, on and off medications, and completely unable to pull herself out of a deep, sucking, all-consuming clinical depression . What makes Brampton's story important and powerful is the way she eventually scrabbles and claws her way back to life. She shares how she's learned to manage and contain her illness \u2014 friendship, long walks, yoga, acupuncture, cognitive behavioral therapy, and a plethora of other coping mechanisms \u2014 but the \"black dog days\" Winston Churchill famously referred to never feel far enough away for her to be comfortable. Brampton knows that her depression will never be cured, but she has gotten it under control, and her lyrical, moving memoir may be able to help others do the same.\n\nWasted: A Memoir of Anorexia and Bulimia by Marya Hornbacher\n\nClick Here To Buy.\n\nThis Pulitzer Prize-nominated memoir is a testament to Marya Hornbacher's immense talent, but nothing, not her obvious gift for writing, her family, friends, or endless therapy, could save her from herself. Hornbacher binged, purged, starved, abused drugs, and indulged in risky sexual behavior even after five lengthy hospital stays and the loss of everyone she loved and everything she cared about. She goes into her self-sabotaging behavior in wrenching, graphic detail, and her honesty makes it all the more affecting. What becomes painfully clear through the course of the memoir is that the decision to get help had to be Hornbacher's. No one could make it for her; she had to recover on her own terms. But once she decided to change her life, she was determined to \"never, never, not ever, I repeat never, give up.\" Hornbacher's story is deeply personal and intimate, and ultimately inspiring.\n\n\n\nHurry Down Sunshine by Michael Greenberg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Greenberg chronicles his 15-year-old daughter's terrifying descent into madness in this gripping, moving memoir. Sally was a precocious and vivacious adolescent one day, and in the throes of a devastating psychotic episode the next. \u201cShe had learned to speak from me; she had heard her first stories from me,\u201d Greenberg writes. \u201cAnd yet from one day to the next we had become strangers.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSo many people who are forced to watch a loved one grapple with a mental illness will deeply relate to Greenberg's utter confusion in the face of his daughter's devastating transformation. At one point he takes some of Sally's antipsychotic medication simply because he wants so badly to understand what she is experiencing. He doesn't try to make sense of Sally's illness, or even try to figure out where it came from, but instead records his struggle to get his daughter the help she needs. We don't often mental illness from this personal, intimate perspective, and it's one we can all benefit from.\n\nWillow Weep for Me: A Black Woman's Journey Through Depression by Meri Nana-Ama Danquah\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's no coincidence that the title of Danquah's eloquent, poignant memoir comes from a Billie Holiday song. Certain parallels exist between the lives' of the two women, from their difficult childhoods, to their substance abuse problems, to their creative, artistic personalities. Danquah is a performance artist and creative writing instructor, and her natural gift with language shines through in her memoir. She writes about being abandoned by her father, experiencing childhood sexual abuse, struggling with racism , and her subsequent descent into overwhelming depression, with courage and honesty. Unlike the tragic Holiday, Danquah was able to slowly pull herself out of the depths of her depression and alcohol dependency. Her memoir details her path to recovery, and her experience finding strength and peace in music, meditation, and vigilant self-monitoring. Like Billie Holiday's most moving songs, Danquah's story is poignant, heartfelt, and ultimately uplifting.\n\nAn Unquiet Mind: A Memoir of Moods and Madness by Kay Redfield Jamison\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm sitting here staring at this book, remembering how utterly transfixed I was the first time I read it. It was required for one of my psychology courses in college, and while I was reading it I felt for the first time like someone really understood me. Here was this smart, talented girl, who made extremely questionable life choices and engaged in risky behavior not because she was stupid, but just because \u2014 consequences be damned. Or, more accurately, the consequences were never even considered. Honestly, it compelled me to go to a therapist for the first time , because I did not want to hit rock bottom the way Kay Redfield Jamison did. And maybe I never would have, but honestly, I thank my lucky stars I read it when I did. This book isn't described as \"life-changing\" or \"transformative\" just to sell copies, it's described that way because it's true. Take it from someone who knows.\n\nProzac Nation by Elizabeth Wurtzel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen people think mental illness memoirs, they think Prozac Nation, and for good reason. It was pretty groundbreaking in 1994 because Wurtzel writes so candidly about her unpredictable, dangerous mood swings and bouts of debilitating depression. And she's funny. I know mental illness is nothing to joke about, but supposedly laughter is the best medicine, and a little comic relief here and there can be a beautiful thing.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe memoir also delves deeply into the dark side of mental illness, and Wurtzel unflinchingly details her absolutely inability to feel happiness, and how that in turn made it very difficult for her to feel empathy. She is brutally honest about how her depression makes her an almost perpetual navel-gazer. In the end, she is far from well, but at least has found a bit of equilibrium. Her intensely personal narrative helped a whole generation open up about depression, suicidal thoughts, and mood swings.\n\nBlue Genes by Christopher Lukas\n\n\n\nClick Here To Buy.\n\nI was devastated by this memoir. If only this family had felt like they could talk about their history of mental illness, the outcome may have been so different. But therein, also, lies the power of the story of Christopher (Kit) and Tony Lukas, because it is a testament to the absolute necessity of discussing every aspect of mental illness, from the symptoms, to the diagnosis, to the treatment.\n\nThe Lukas' mother committed suicide when they were children, and no one discussed it, or their family history of bipolar disorder and depression. Both brothers grew up to be gifted, successful, adults, Tony as an accomplished journalist, and Kit as a television director and producer. Kit was able to make peace with his own depression as well as his family history of mental illness, but Tony continued to be haunted, and tragically committed suicide in 1997. We need to be talking about these issues.\n\nLucky by Alice Sebold\n\nClick Here To Buy.\n\nAs the prevalence of sexual assault on college campuses becomes higher-profile, memoirs like Alice Sebold's become more and more important. Sebold was an 18-year-old college freshman when she was brutally raped and beaten in a park near campus. Her memoir details the fallout of this excruciatingly painful, horrible experience. While struggling with PTSD and other side effects of severe trauma, she had the grit and determination to pursue justice and helped secure her attacker's arrest and conviction. This is such an important read for anyone who has experienced sexual assault, or loves someone who has. These survivors need to know that they are not alone, that they can gain control over what happened to them, and ultimately, their lives.\n\nSkin Game by Caroline Kettlewell\n\n\n\nClick Here To Buy.\n\nCaroline Kettlewell began cutting herself at age 12, and continued into her 20s, physically hurting herself in order to deal with her feelings of pain and alienation. I think this disorder in particular is often portrayed in pop-culture as an affliction of the \"crazy\" adolescent girl, but as Kettlewell writes, \"in the U.S. alone as many as two to three million people engage in self-injury.\" Obviously hurting yourself on the outside to deal with the overwhelming feelings you're having on the inside is not as \"crazy\" or uncommon as people would like to think. Which is why it's so important for people like Kettlewell to tell their stories, to bring attention to the problem, and to help those suffering from it realize that they can ask for help.\n\nThe Quiet Room by Lori Schiller and Amanda Bennett\n\n\n\nClick Here To Buy.\n\nA full-blown schizophrenic episode is absolutely terrifying, both for the person who is experiencing it and for the people in her life. At 17 Lori Schiller had a pretty perfect-seeming life \u2014 an affluent, close-knit family, a bright future, and tons of potential. Fast-forward six years, and Schiller is wandering the streets of New York, suicidal and dressed in rags, a slave to the arbitrary voices in her head.\n\nWhat follows is Schiller's struggle to find some small measure of sanity. Over the next several years she is in and out of institutions and halfway houses, fighting against relapse and often falling into utter despair. She ultimately finds a bit of equilibrium, but she makes it clear that she never would have survived without the help of an incredible doctor and her family. Like so many others, Schiller will never be \"cured,\" but she is managing her illness. What she makes so startlingly obvious through her narrative is the arbitrary nature of mental illness. It can strike anyone at anytime. No one is immune.\n\nJust Checking: Scenes From the Life of an Obsessive-Compulsive by Emily Colas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObsessive-compulsive disorder is often portrayed humorously in our society. Like \"Oh, it's so funny, my aunt can't leave the house without touching the doorknob exactly 45 times,\" but really, it's not funny. Colas uses humor in her memoir to connect with her readers, and also as a coping mechanism, but she doesn't minimize the disastrous effect the disorder had on her life. Through a series of personal vignettes, Colas shares how the illness infiltrated every aspect of her daily life, from her relationship with her husband, to her ability to leave the house. Her struggle to regain control over her compulsions is touching, realistic, and an eye-opening glimpse into what it's like to live with OCD.\n\nElectroboy by Andy Behrman\n\n\n\n\n\nMania is often associated with intense periods of productivity. People who experience manic episodes often describe them as the most energetic periods of their life, when they had the stamina and relentless drive to stay up all night writing, or painting, or composing. But as Behrman so eloquently describes in his memoir, what goes up must come down, and people who experience mania crash hard.\n\n\n\n\n\nBehrman hid his own manic episodes behind a larger-than-life personality \u2014 he was always jumping from high to high, relentlessly searching out the next big thing. Misdiagnosed for years, his craving for stimulation eventually led him to the world of art forgery. The experience ended in incarceration and house arrest. At this point Behrman was swallowing antidepressants and tranquilizers by the handful, and he knew he was losing his grip on his mind for what might be the last time. As a last resort, he opts for electroschock therapy. Behrman's memoir is simultaneously deeply entertaining, and a cautionary tale about the\n\nBehrman hid his own manic episodes behind a larger-than-life personality \u2014 he was always jumping from high to high, relentlessly searching out the next big thing.

Highly intelligent for sure, but nothing like the \"normal\" kids. From 13-year-old Jesus freak to teenage shoplifter, Pershall documents her eating disorders, self-inflicted injuries, and chronic mood swings. She is eventually diagnosed with bipolar and borderline personality disorder, but her journey to understanding her illness and her struggle with the mental health care system are well-documented in this moving, eye-opening memoir.\n\nWelcome to My Country by Lauren Slater\n\n\n\nClick Here To Buy.\n\nSlater's memoir is a fascinating, astonishing look at treating mental illness from a therapist's perspective. She writes about her patients and their disorders \u2014 schizophrenia, depression, bipolar \u2014 candidly and with compassion. She really humanizes the treatment process. So often people who suffer from mental illness can be made to feel sub-human, like having this illness strips them of basic personhood or something. Slater's memoir gives us a glimpse at what a therapist should be: sympathetic, understanding, and above all, invested in the treatment of her patient.\n\nEventually we discover that Slater's deep devotion to her clients comes from a place of personal experience, as she herself was hospitalized for mental illness as a young woman. This is such a powerful story, emphasizing the incalculable importance of finding the right treatment and support.\n\nGirl, Interrupted by Susanna Kaysen\n\n\n\nClick Here To Buy.\n\nSusanna Kaysen, and her story about life in the psychiatric ward, were made famous when her memoir was adapted into a movie starring Winona Ryder (as Kaysen) and Angelina Jolie.\n\nIn 1967, after one session with a psychiatrist she had never even laid on eyes on before, Kaysen was shipped off to an institution renowned for its famous clientele like Sylvia Plath and Ray Charles. Her vivid account of what she witnessed as a patient there was groundbreaking. She exposed the fine, arbitrary line society drew between sane and insane, and her critique of the mental health system was, and still is, much needed.\n\n\n\nMake a vow to grab one of these books during Mental Health Month \u2014 there's a lot to learn.\n\nImages: Helga Weber/Flickr; Giphy (4)\n\n", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/78021-during-mental-health-month-pick-up-one-of-these-15-memoirs-about-mental-illness-that-should", "summary": "Mental illness touches every person's life in some way \u2014 that's one of the reasons Mental Health Month was created.\nMemoirs about mental illness can be invaluable resources, giving insight and detailed, honest accounts about what it actually feels like to deal with a disorder.\nThat means you, your sister, your mom, your significant other, or your best friend is living with a mental illness.\nProzac Nation by Elizabeth WurtzelWhen people think mental illness memoirs, they think Prozac Nation, and for good reason.\nSo often people who suffer from mental illness can be made to feel sub-human, like having this illness strips them of basic personhood or something.", "timescraped": 1513838353.7985458, "category": {"words": 2692, "personal": 22, "thirdperson": 148, "condition": 28, "recovery": 1}}, "bc030346f63db18e6d3feddc82221b02": {"title": "14 Mental Health Quotes For World Mental Health Day 2016, Because The More We Talk About It The Better", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost%2F2016%2F10%2F10%2Fa9c05e50-3c10-4c05-9591-270c3662f193.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "text": "If you've ever wondered how you can help those who suffer from mental health issues, the biggest piece of advice that I can offer you is to keep talking about it. These mental health quotes for World Mental Health Day 2016 do not shy away from the often tabooed topic of mental health, and for that reason, they are some of the most effective words somebody suffering from depression, anxiety, or any other kind of mental sickness can possibly hear.\n\nStigmatizing the topic of mental health helps no one, and studies have actually shown that the more somebody feels stigmatized, the less likely he or she is to seek support services. And the less likely somebody is to seek support services, the less likely he or she is to be treated and potentially overcome his or her mental illness. So long story short? Talk about mental health and mental illnesses. Don't turn it into something that makes people feel ashamed or awkward.\n\nIn America an estimated 26.2 percent of adults (ages 18 and older) suffer from a diagnosable mental disorder in any given year. That means that one out of every four adults struggles with mental illness within the short course of 12 months. That is a high percentage, translating to approximately 58 million adults. All that being said, it's clear that mental illness is not a rarity, and it shouldn't be treated as such.

It ranges from person to person, and as someone who has dealt with different levels of anxiety most of her life, it's certainly a tricky thing to battle on a day-to-day basis. While there are a bunch of different ways one can start conquering anxiety, one method that has helped me is journal writing.\n\nAccording to Psychology Today, \"There's simply no better way to learn about your thought processes than to write them down.\" Journaling has a lot of health benefits, and no matter who you are or what you do, everyone can use a journal. It's a private and relaxed way to unwind from the day, jot down your thoughts, and dive deep into those complicated emotions and anxieties bothering you.\n\nI love to write in general, but writing in my journal has always been a healthy way to organize my thoughts, stressors, anxieties, and fears. While there are a ton of journal prompts avalaible to use when it comes to writing about anxiety, I often find myself jumping from one to the next just because they're somewhat basic questions. So, I got creative. Using ideas from friends, teachers, family, and other writers, I've come up with seven creative journal prompts that you'll have fun with, while also bettering yourself and your mind along the way:\n\n1. Write Out Your Emotions Like A Grocery List\n\nMaybe you need avocados, bread, and oranges this week \u2014 but what does your mind need? Maybe some alone time, a half hour with a good book, or even a night of just binge-watching a show with your best friend. Whatever it is, treat those needs like you would a grocery list and make sure you find a way to get them.\n\n\n\nAnother way to do this is to start listing off your fears and anxieties on a piece of paper, and then writing out your strengths. Push yourself with the strengths and list out more strengths than fears if possible. Then look at the two lists, keep it close by when you need it, and you'll find you have a lot more strengths than you probably realize.\n\nOne last \"grocery list\" that can help with stress is to list out all the things you feel you need to do, then list out all the things you can do within the time you're given. Realizing that you're not Wonder Woman or a time traveler is often a way to help snap your anxiety and stress back into place. It often helps to list things out like this because it gives you a moment to calm your thoughts and organize your to-do list, rather than let it all take over your mind.\n\n2. Write A Letter To Someone And Never Send It\n\nSometimes anxieties and fears can build up to the point that you just need to rant or tell someone about it, and that can be completely healthy. However, sometimes anxiety attacks strike in the middle of the night when no one is around and able to help. Use your journal when this happens. Address the letter to the person you want to talk with (this can be anyone you want, real or not), and tell them how you're feeling. Don't be afraid to say everything you want to say because you won't be sending this. This prompt can also help you organize your thoughts if you do need to talk to someone in real life but aren't sure how to go about it.\n\n\n\n3. Imagine Your Anxiety As A Monster And Write A Story About It\n\nI know, this sounds weird, but stay with me. As a kid, you were probably afraid of some sort of monster, and as you grew older, you realized it wasn't much to be afraid of. Taking your anxieties and forming them into a creature may sound terrifying, but every monster has a weakness. Write a story about you battling this monster. Find its weak spot. If you like, you can even reshape and mold your monster as time goes on to see if this monster grows smaller, bigger, or completely disappears all together.\n\n\n\n4. Interview Your Past And Future Self\n\nDon't look at this like a stressful job interview. Do look at this as a way to reflect and motivate. Interview your past self by asking questions like: Are you scared of anything? What do you want to be when you grow up? What's your favorite memory?\n\nThen interview your future self with questions like: How did you get to where you are today? What advice would you give your past self? What are your current fears and anxieties? Compare the two and see the similarities and differences. Obviously your future self is imagined. But picturing where you'd like to be and realizing that you'll get past whatever your current anxieties is important to keep in mind.\n\n\n\n5. Imagine Your Favorite Fictional Character Has The Same Problems As You And Figure Out How They'd Solve Them\n\nPut Hermione Granger in your shoes \u2014 or even Matilda or Elizabeth Bennet \u2014 and imagine how they would react to your stressors and anxieties. It often helps to have a great role model, and by having these strong characters to take on your fears just might reveal a creative solution to any tricky issue you're facing.\n\n\n\n6. Use Colorful Markers Or Pens And Write Out All The Things That Make You Happy\n\nThanks to the adult coloring book, we now recognize coloring is a beneficial and fun activity for tackling anxiety, no matter the age. And while coloring books can help you relax and become less anxious, journaling about what makes you happy is also another way to turn your mindset on a more positive note. Using vibrant colors is just a way to make those happy things even brighter for you. By the time you're done, it'll be a masterpiece \u2014 one that should be hung in your bedroom so you'll always have a happiness reminder when you need it.\n\n\n\n7. Start Your Journal With The Phrase \"I Remember Feeling...\"\n\nI remember feeling happy when... I remember feeling upset when... I remember...\n\nThis phrase can bring up a lot of different emotions and memories, some of which you may be scared to tackle \u2014 and that's OK. Often anxiety is rooted deeply into our past, and it can hide so well we aren't sure where a fear came from. This journaling prompt allows you to revisit happy or sad times and take a better, more mindful look at them. It's good to realize how you're feeling, but it's even better and more helpful for tackling anxiety to understand why you feel or felt a certain way.\n\n\n\nImages: Stocksnap/Pexels; Giphy", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/156986-7-journal-prompts-that-will-help-tackle-anxiety", "summary": "While there are a bunch of different ways one can start conquering anxiety, one method that has helped me is journal writing.\nI love to write in general, but writing in my journal has always been a healthy way to organize my thoughts, stressors, anxieties, and fears.\nRealizing that you're not Wonder Woman or a time traveler is often a way to help snap your anxiety and stress back into place.\nHowever, sometimes anxiety attacks strike in the middle of the night when no one is around and able to help.\nImagine Your Anxiety As A Monster And Write A Story About ItI know, this sounds weird, but stay with me.", "timescraped": 1513838356.4017122, "category": {"words": 1141, "personal": 9, "thirdperson": 7, "condition": 7, "recovery": 0}}, "57079a4bd9bcba356bd647550acd9545": {"title": "This Girl\u2019s Tweet About Her Father\u2019s Mental Health Journey Is Resonating Hard On Twitter", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/uploads/image/2017/11/29/19fb5786-1a3f-46e7-ba06-3c5b4e7ac7fa-screen-shot-2017-11-29-at-30814-pm.png?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "text": "Mental health stigma has long been a major issue worldwide \u2014 and sadly, it's still ongoing today, making efforts to break the stigma more important than ever. A young woman\u2019s tweet about her father\u2019s depression has done just that, drawing attention not only to the importance of mental health awareness, but also to the hope that things can and do get better. What\u2019s more, the very fact that the tweet has gone viral in the first place offers even greater encouragement: Not only are people speaking out about these important issues, but moreover, people are listening to them.\n\nIn June of 2014, Brian Wilkie\u2019s son Jordan, then 22, died by suicide. As a result, Wilkie\u2019s daughter Ellie tells Bustle, \u201cMental health is massive in my family\u201d: The loss of Jordan, who was Ellie\u2019s step brother, \u201cstemmed [her] dad\u2019s depression and ultimate breakdown.\u201d After the first anniversary of Jordan\u2019s death, Wilkie sought treatment \u2014 but it can sometimes take a lot of trial and error before finding effective treatment, and he began to feel worse. In January, he attempted suicide in the family home in Edinburgh.\n\nBut he survived \u2014 and he\u2019s been on the road to recovery ever since. It hasn\u2019t been easy, of course, for Wilkie or for his family; says Ellie, \u201cIn the beginning, my whole family fell into the darkest hole. As my dad was the rock, him falling apart left [us] lost and unable to see a breakthrough.\u201d But he sought help: He\u2019s received specialist treatment, he began going to the gym regularly, he gave up alcohol, and he puts his energy towards helping others. He is now a recovery support worker.\n\nThe family, too, has recovered along with Wilkie. \u201cAs my dad gained the help, the family did, too,\u201d Ellie tells Bustle. \u201cMy dad\u2019s headspace was so low with depression he truly couldn\u2019t see the family around loving and support[ing] him. His recovery has now meant we are stronger and closer than ever.\u201d\n\nThis year began with my dad mentally suffering depression and suicide attempt. Today he ends the year starting his new career in becoming a recovery support worker. Words can't describe how proud we are #breakthestigma It's okay not to be okay\u2764\ufe0f \u2014 (@ellzthelephant) #\n\nIn tribute to Wilkie\u2019s recovery and her family\u2019s strength, Ellie posted a photograph of her dad and herself to Twitter on Nov. 22. The photo is simple; taken with a smartphone in a mirror, it shows father and daughter in her bedroom, both smiling together. \u201cThis year began with my dad mentally suffering depression and suicide attempt,\u201d she wrote. \u201cToday he ends the year starting his new career in becoming a recovery support worker. Words can\u2019t describe how proud we are.\u201d Using the hashtag #breakthestigma, she added, \u201cIt\u2019s OK not to be OK.\u201d\n\nAnd she\u2019s right: It\u2019s OK not to be OK. And we need to make sure that message is heard loud and clear.\n\nApproximately one in five adults in the United States will experience mental illness in a given year, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI); meanwhile, in the UK, one in one in four adults will experience mental illness in their lifetime, according to the Mental Health Foundation. But how our culture deals with mental illness is telling: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 57 percent of adults believe that people are caring and sympathetic to people with mental illness \u2014 but only 25 percent of adults who actually have mental health symptoms believe the same. And although most adults both with and without mental illness believe that treatment can be a big help for people with mental illness, the stigma against mental illness rife throughout our culture can actually prevent people from getting the treatment they need. This stigma can also cause discrimination in real, tangible ways \u2014 or, as a Huffington Post piece from 2016 put it, mental health stigma really is discrimination.\n\nThis is why breaking the stigma is so important \u2014 and acknowledging that, as Ellie puts it, it\u2019s OK not to be OK can go a long way towards accomplishing that goal.\n\nEllie\u2019s Twitter post went massively viral; as of this writing, it has received nearly 30,000 retweets, almost 170,000 likes, and hundreds of replies expressing support and solidarity. The ITV morning television program This Morning even reached out to the Wilkies to feature their story on the show; however, news of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u2019s engagement unfortunately resulted in the segment getting pulled.\n\nUnfortunately today was not the day for our story to be heard. Due to breaking news our story was cut off live tv. The royal wedding will go ahead however mental health issues will always remain \u2764\ufe0f until next time Dad. #breakthestigma \u2014 (@ellzthelephant) #\n\nThis Morning released a statement on Twitter about the schedule change, writing, \u201cUnfortunately due to yesterday's breaking news, we had to reschedule some of our planned features. Ellie and Brian had prior commitments this week, but we have extended an open invitation so they can share their story with us when they next become available.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately due to yesterday's breaking news, we had to reschedule some of our planned features. Ellie and Brian had prior commitments this week, but we have extended an open invitation so they can share their story with us when they next become available. \u2014 (@thismorning) #\n\nSome Twitter users have noted that the schedule change is problematic, especially consider that both princes \u2014 Harry in particular \u2014 have made mental health awareness a large part of their work; however, the Wilkies\u2019 story is still being told loud and clear: Media pickups include those ranging from the BBC to BuzzFeed, and the power of social media has continued to pass along the family\u2019s message of hope.\n\nEllie describes the story going viral as \u201cscary yet amazing.\u201d She tells Bustle, \u201cI knew it had the public captivated because it\u2019s clear they need this. Mental health is a taboo hidden away and never spoken about. We are just real people with a real story hoping to engage the public to help save people in their darkest days.\u201d\n\nFor those who may either be dealing with something similar to that which her dad and family have gone through, or for those who know someone who is, she has these words of advice: \u201cIn the beginning, you may feel resentful towards [your] family member; however, my advice is, stick by them regardless. They will need it and thank you for it. Keep your family together and reinforce constantly that it\u2019s OK not to be OK. Eventually there will be light. It will take constant effort; however, with love and support, we can end the stigma.\u201d\n\nIf you or someone you know might be at risk for suicide, you can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 in the United States and the Samaritans at 116 123 in the UK.", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/p/this-girls-tweet-about-her-fathers-mental-health-journey-is-resonating-hard-on-twitter-6687480", "summary": "Mental health stigma has long been a major issue worldwide \u2014 and sadly, it's still ongoing today, making efforts to break the stigma more important than ever.\nApproximately one in five adults in the United States will experience mental illness in a given year, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI); meanwhile, in the UK, one in one in four adults will experience mental illness in their lifetime, according to the Mental Health Foundation.\nAnd although most adults both with and without mental illness believe that treatment can be a big help for people with mental illness, the stigma against mental illness rife throughout our culture can actually prevent people from getting the treatment they need.\nThis stigma can also cause discrimination in real, tangible ways \u2014 or, as a Huffington Post piece from 2016 put it, mental health stigma really is discrimination.\nMental health is a taboo hidden away and never spoken about.", "timescraped": 1513838357.785547, "category": {"words": 1146, "personal": 18, "thirdperson": 39, "condition": 21, "recovery": 6}}}
